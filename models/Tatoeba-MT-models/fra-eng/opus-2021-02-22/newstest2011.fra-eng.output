What is going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new elected CSSD members at the city hall of the capital will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier in order to understand each other at the level of the city council with their old and new colleagues of the ODS.
The daily Actualne.cz has "tested" the new members of the city council belonging to CSSD, whether they know the argot that was born in the last few years at the town hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition that led in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political cream set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was with surprise that it was discovered that the new elected officials did not understand very well the terms known.
At least they say so.
"Who's Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a young man in Prague politics has reacted Lukas Kaucky, the chosen one to culture, to the test of the vocabulary of the "sponsor".
And as far as the political veteran is concerned, elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
"It's the only expression among the ones you propose to me that I use"
Otherwise, I don't use the arbot.
From the vocabulary, of which the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-electoral congress of the ODS, the editorial has chosen 6 examples, in priority those that are related with the town hall of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the patisserie", "beef nerve", "trahison of the capital" and "enter".
Three of the elected officials agreed to the quiz, the fourth- Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek totally refused the test.
"I do not care at all about these things and how the representatives of citizen democracy have fun: I will not give my opinion."
"I'm currently working on how we're going to understand each other in our programs," he responded.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky apparently does not recognize in the above legend that this is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former Mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky said and immediately added: "But I know it from the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the chosen for the environment, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two Social Democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of the meaning of "go to the pastry".
"It's, I think, going to a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it's the head office of the Janousek companies.
In the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests there is no argot lexicon in social democracy.
"I took advice with colleagues and it appears that we really don't have anything of this type."
"We say to ourselves the names sometimes we use abbreviations and symbols," says Peter Hlinsky, president of the Social Democratic Party, which the members of the Party call Hulda.
"They called me Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," says Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily Actual.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for the members of the Party or the least friendly Little old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by scams during the party's sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones admitted to be used within the party by the Social Democrats.
It seems that Hulinsky doesn't like to hear Hulda much, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this Pragois president.
"Doctor of Truncheon Law" says Petr Hulinsky obtained his title of Doctor of Law JUDr. at the Police Academy of Bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches", published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women who have been declared witches have common features.
Rather, they are part of the old generation, cannot work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The woman who becomes a witch is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man very rarely has this destiny."
"We also do not judge young women in good health because they participate in work and give birth to children," says a sister who works in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He published a brochure that should help limit witch hunting.
There's a "hic" in the case.
"More than 70 per cent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the daily Die Standard warned about the disadvantage of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighbor of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and burned with oil that they had sprinkled on her.
This information was transmitted by the BBC server.
The criminals say it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointings was flammulated in contact with the woman.
The oil flaming, it seems, when the team wanted to "hunt the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people at all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human spirit eaters have always been a danger," he says.
As Burkina Faso strives to reduce witch hunting, the Gambia has even seen the President himself participate in the process as recently as last year.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt which, it seems, took part in his death and tried with black magic to kill the President as well."
"Shams from nearby Guinea came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal custody of the President, men and women randomly chosen from villages in Gambia," Amnesty International said in a message.
On the farm, imprisoned people had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects which in addition caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
About a thousand people were released from international pressure.
The tenant of Bakal: The stoves are heating, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man came out through the door of the RPG Byty customer centre of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new leases for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and son who is serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 second category apartment 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works with solid fuel", point out on the new contract of his son the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed anyway," he explains, motivated angry and half resigned.
The citizen association of apartments BytyOKD.cz who described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, the date on which a notice will be published explaining the method to be followed to claim.
But the man reacts to this by a gesture of the hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" by frowning.
The Ostrava region became the laboratory for deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
For this reason, Aktualne.cz decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The waiting room of RPG in Havirovska Street is one of the four in the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Right next door stands a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is on the touch screen.
Only one pressure and one paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" as your number already starts to light up on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it's your turn.
After a short while, an old couple arrives to find out about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems like everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving mail with new leases in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special window for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still on trial," answers the employee behind the counter after a moment of hesitation when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The deragulation and the former apartments of minors of Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of parliament and from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported it in a fairly sustained way before the elections and it now fills the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change me a put...n board in the toilets, relieves himself in introduction the man mentioned.
However, according to the employees, it is mainly pensioners who come to make sure that they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they sign now as promised by RPG in a special offer.
This is a rebate of half of the rent that will be paid to the other lessees who have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by the questions.
"Of the 360 clients who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," says the employee at the counter.
And yet RPG is posing individual interviews on rents when needed, both on its website and in the showcases.
If both parties do not agree on the rent, an independent tribunal will make the decision.
"It's not a question of threats, it's just to inform about the unique and legitimate way to act legally," says RPG on its website.
"Here no one will go to court" thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man in the street in front of the customer center agrees.
"I have 13,000 pension crowns and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore the people wait," she says.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the fund for housing that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase of the rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rents to invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs of the waiting room of Havirosvka Street, repeats however some information indicated in red.
'The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments'.
"And it will always be no more than 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," says the screen.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, it is an increase of a really very low sum 19.66 Czech kroner per square metre", adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement have priority.
The nursery school is also part of the offices that have understood the architects.
Brno's Avriopoint administrative building is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini kindergarten with everything you need - color walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of Arch. design employees can go there.
The architectural-project company Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini nursery business school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially of the age to make children, and it was important that women architects and project managers could quickly return to work.
At the same time as reduced employment contracts, nursery school is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work taking care of children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who imagined this nursery school and with the support of the management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-school is financed by the European Social Fund through the Human Resources Operational Programme and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding allocations (up to CZK 2.8 mil.) they were able to purchase equipment and appliances and after two years provide qualified personnel and start-up.
After the use of the funding endowment (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini nursery school from its own funds.
Project preparation lasted one year and Economy rating helped make the staffing request.
The children are cared for by qualified staff, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of the children all day long. Children can go to kindergarten without age limit but they are over three years old for the most part.
Since it is a "mini nursery school" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who replace each other.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although there is individual care and education, the nursery school curriculum is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children don't just play, but quality education is also provided - from the beginning to school preparation, English is taught.
The classroom is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can control their child at any time and do not have the stress of being late to pick up the children from a school away from the parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty is created between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design. has thus registered among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and that are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens the marketing of HR.
The bone house fascinates again after 100 years. Take a look in Gaudi's interiors.
The toit resembles the back of a prehistoric saurien, the stairway to a dinosaur spine and the balconies to open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona of architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house was given the nickname Bone House by the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, façade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is ypic for the Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaudi.
The front façade of the house unfolds its dream lines, pleasant colours and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation one sees the geometry, the rhythm and the thought order with precision.
In the night the façade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood reproduces in waves the window frames, balustrades, decorative elements of the doors, the eyepiece and the slats.
The Battlo house which stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at number 43, was born from the construction of a house in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another brand new one but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-dwelling house was not conceived by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations were born for a representation apartment of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade.
For the facade have also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for the plans of Casa Battlo House began with successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi Casa Mila's house and Guell Park in which there are other Gaudi's works.
The locals nicknamed the hot house just after it was finished because of its organic shapes "the Bone House".
Others, in view of the specific window opening mechanism, have called it "the house that yawns".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculpture elements of the construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination seems odd.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not comply with the construction directives of the time and did not allow himself to be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained a building permit from the city, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the finish the city council was horrified and asked for modifications.
For example, members of the city council were not pleased that the pillars of construction were encroaching on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) for permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and in the third there was a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which one accesses to an independent toit terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the salons and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit itself to the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi received in addition to new facades a non-traditional roof and two more floors.
Gaudi's play with the light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which is decorated the inner courtyard and with the skylights.
The two-color game gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was simply to bet on the principle that the white reflects more than the dark which on the contrary absorbs the rays of the sun.
Casa Battlo House, which was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found it to be a lucrative business and extended the scope of the visits to the common areas and the attic, including the toit terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discounts.
The sum is still above the entrance price in Gaudi's other buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the residents of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a bed base: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for the bed, so the mattress and bed base give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive: the weight, the height, the age, the state of health as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and spring are to be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where latex mattresses are not continuously sleeping, they are not suitable because they "warm up" gently.
In addition, they have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they do not also have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they also remain on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mould can also form there.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
The person who spends the clear of time abroad where very thick mattresses with a softening layer are frequently used, will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how everyone who comes back from NHL complains that they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a simmering layer of lazy foam."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder which therefore assume poorly "information" of joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hokeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything works well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses, for example.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to be able to enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won't turn around in the night like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against squars.
To choose the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220cm.
The minimum width for each for a two-seater bed should be 90 cm or a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, singles for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should lay hands comfortably with the elbows slightly bent. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-mattressiers and decorators who has been dedicated for several years to the problem of a healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and sign in specialized schools.
For a two-seater bed each needs its own bed base and mattress, so be careful however during the purchase to choose the height of the mattress well.
Otherwise, you will only have to mount the base at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which count for the layer of shape and ventilation at least three centimeters.
"To the touch or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a specific type of spring.
The bed-bed, when the mattress and the bed base are united like siamoese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; it should not be washed, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night we normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress starts to recall a large (and clogged) sieve.
For this purpose the specialists refuse to make a claim over a life of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But everything to his but.
And for this, an experience advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the coating of the mattress, hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to make coatings with zippers for the whole set, that is to say that after the opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the handling for the big models (and for one person only) becomes when they are removed a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight in a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a springboard?
Never!
Maximum for a bed intended for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are none) with ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with sachet springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an aeration layer.
A polyurethane mattress must not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-slatted mattresses with 14/18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut) are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are doubled in the lower part of the kidneys and it is thus possible to regulate the rigidity of them.
For multi-position mattresses, spring mattresses should not be taken because they do not respond to position changes.
Next to the adjustment of the rigidity of the slats we can also install what is called a shoulder cradle.
This is a special connection of the slats that allows to pressure or even tilt the slat so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have "shoulders as wide as their backs," this is really an important thing.
This thing is already being considered by mattress manufacturers who for "masculines" have begun to use a softening area at shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they offer them a softer surface at the hips again.
For the most difficult customer there are winged or padded bottoms with what is called a multi-force suspension.
Pressure spreads to more points and diinches tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and swollen with air) on good mattresses and springboard, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that the Scandinavians prefer by example.
When lying on the side, the pillow must level (with the cradle of the shoulder of the spring or the area softened in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones based on straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also with organic mattresses.
The petrole-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soya oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soy.
"The Bio term for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop perfumes from the forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of birch plants so that the coating of the mattress absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
The red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
The current favourites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cellular structure so more breathable than the standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesses of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, lower back and feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7,000 crowns and more.
Those characterised by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached first place.
Saving for the mattress and the bed base is not simple.
From time to time, two mattresses for the price of a single mattress may be used as part of special actions by manufacturers or producers.
For example, Magniflex offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory memory foam sewn to cover for 11990 crowns.
We can obviously take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a great thickness was started with Tempur material at a "cosmic" rhythm.
This began as a matter for NASA because astronauts were subjected to enormous load factors at start-up.
The Tempur softens with heat and hardens, on the contrary, with cold.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this purpose against sleeping sickness and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special cushions for feet that relieve legs and venous system.
Czech manufacturers use e.g. EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly being requested by parents who want to watch over their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can just as well be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases as exemple that of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a match box but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka has moved a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not espionage but only another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware of it, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
"The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons," adds Pilin.
According to him, children should always know for what purpose "the box" is used and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to focus on him something of this type, he will get rid of it.
'And even the smaller ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something on purpose when they don't want to be under control'.
"Mobile phones, which can be cut off like these tracking devices, have already led parents to long expectations," says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of an attack is highly questionable.
"If it is a prepared abduction, the author will do everything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him or her."
"Currently, it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracing devices develop, they (the criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases the criminals will always be ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
She admits, however, that such devices can help in an assault not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an assault.
"The device may be set in such a way that it is in regular emission after a specified period of time".
"In the event that the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned".
"The more expensive devices also have a reclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and ends up lying down without moving," says Cech.
According to him, the so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after formatting it with a special prologist.
The problem with current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn in pendants the size of a match box or the smallest telephone sets.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, that is why tests are being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"It will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracing device."
"Or he'll find out after a while, which will give the police a little more time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as for tracing cars.
This is a combination of GPS position acquisition systems (which are commonly used in auto-navigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating ropes that it could go around the Czech Republic with it, but it can only last two years.
The army bought for 445 km of cords used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense had purchased 224 km of them.
So the army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the ropes is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating ropes from the limited company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as reason for the purchase of a huge amount of detonating cords to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be made by the army's pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with command, secretaries or household staff should have an annual exercise in explosives.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating ropes.
At this distance is 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army reserves could support it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is sufficient to more than 2 m of detonating ropes, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase ensured - also with the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that the shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
We're not talking about the lack of body linen.
"And I don't mind if they buy from us such a large amount of detonating ropes."
"And it's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"For us the army is a good customer that we strive as traders to be content," says STV Group sales manager Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of kilometres of detonating ropes will be lost by the fact that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reported only four years of life of the detonating cords and the pyrotechnicians of the police and army of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can go up to four years," says one who does not want his name to be published in view of the army's criticism.
Each munition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the soldier's life.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The Department's other argument is a quantity discount for 445 km of detonating ropes.
"They cost us 60 per cent less than last year's supply of 245 km," says spokesperson Pejsek, who interprets the advice of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of the police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their lifetime.
This has been established for reasons of safety of pyrotechnicians and to be able to obtain more modern and reliable types of detonating ropes in a more flexible way.
The Ministry of Defence today has major problems for the neutralisation of dozens of tons of ammunition coming from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army strong of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading on the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating ropes that it buys today "at cheap".
Until now, I have benefited from contacts I have obtained through the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the Best Individual Entrepreneur competition.
The winner of last year's Best Individual Entrepreneur competition was 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukas Pytloun.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Libérec there was missing a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in his third year of graduate studies, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our region has made me want to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building which he converted into a boarding house with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, another of the same quality came to him.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the Pytloun franchise came forward", the number 1 of last year's entrepreneurs.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition served well," adds Pytloun with gratitude.
Victory brought him more popularity and to be known to Libérec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win, but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he's been using his contacts and knowledge until now that he couldn't have gotten in any other way.
"With those I met through the contest I began to maintain business relations regularly.
According to him, the reputation associated with success also had an impact on employees.
And he's got about 70.
"I especially observe in them the loyalty and pride of having engaged in something that has been generally recognized."
"This is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to pick up the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million kroner.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged my staff and increased our self-confidence to fight competition," says the winner of last year's competition today.
At the beginning of the history of the Farmet company there was the desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some comrades in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not very long after they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After 18 years it has become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even to the non-specialized public after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers really get to know the Farmet brand better, but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were working with a company that got the greatest success in its home country," says Zdarsky.
But last year did not happen at Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's valuation was based on the economic results of 2008 and part of 2009.
And precisely in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We obviously did not escape this situation."
"Business figures have fallen by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off," Zdarsky explains.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and maintained benefit-earning results even though they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued uncompromisingly to invest in research and development.
"We built with endowments a training and research center, strengthened the company's presentation in international fairs and won the main awards in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything leads us to believe that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of cases go up and with them the number of employees also.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that suppresses insane regulations.
The Absurdity of the Year investigation is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be removed.
The little glorious winner of this year's survey on the Absurdity of the Year was the obligation to bring to the offices documents that officials can obtain on-line.
More than one-third of the 4000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social affairs authorities asked for a paper extract from the business register while the official can obtain it with two clicks of a mouse.
It changes because of the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require the extract from the Trade Register for the control of insurance payments," said Jana Buranova, spokesperson for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs have to fill in in the Czech Republic and to remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this year's absurdity contest.
This investigation is again this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3000 voters came forward, at least 4000 this year brought their votes.
And it's not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only slow down the business, and, that, more and more.
"We may be among the documents to fill out for tax returns in the top places in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank the Czech Republic is in 74th place in terms of conditions for the company, i.e. 8 more places compared to last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first introduced in 2006 and continues each year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic absurdities every year from April to the end of September, which is the final deadline for the closing of the competition.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest selects seven candidates for "the prize" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received the highest number of votes is declared the winner.
Until last year's survey, it was about a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that lost their sense of existence.
Comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also by professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore among the nominees is, for example, the obligation that the maintenance vehicles of motorways and high-speed roads pay the tolls, or that the contractors with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the contest, which still begins in early November at Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the highlight of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts astonishment in the hands of entrepreneurs and for this my objective is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs which today only complicate the enterprise', said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd decrees is not a sword stroke in the water.
In 2007, what was not popular with people was the requirement for entrepreneurs to declare three days before at the office for the sole proprietorship at the location of the business, the intention to go to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the amendment of the Sole proprietorship Act.
The second most popular requirement in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a 30-day tour of duty for a foreign employee, was removed with the so-called Green Card Act.
And everything's fine until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their practice, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the year 2010.
The focus of this competition is reasonable and fair business support.
"We want to support companies that monitor their company's environmental impacts and conduct socially responsible business," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this contest, as in the case of the rebel contest of the year.
For this first year of this sub-category of the competition of the firm of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodaphone, registered companies that have not succeeded with a single long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each of them is full of inspirations and an independent article would be to be published.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be seen as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic is not found the Pragian prologist company Et Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
Another example is Podebrad's old paper manufacturing plant, which employs more than 70 per cent of the workforce and which has obtained the title of Head for the Central Bohemia Region and placed third in the region at the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, which has won for having introduced flexible working hours and even reduced up to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionately, a reduction in wages.
The jury also awarded her the title because she bought first of all from Czech manufacturers, supported a ditoyenne activity in the vicinity and was concerned about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the company's executive director.
the company responsible IT Enlogit of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has put in place for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the Man in the Shadow Foundation, which helps the local Roma community," says Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
In the very last rank is, also for its activities, a company of Washing and cleaning of the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increased skills and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the brustal construction company Czasch, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition, who had responded to the questionnaires as an attachment to the registration document and had sent it to the organiser before 15 August, were automatically registered in the responsible company category.
Uncompleted or incomplete responses in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in competition had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the responsible firm but were not disqualified from the "principal" competition of the year of Vodaphone".
"Independent registration is not possible because it is a sub-category of the main competition of the Firm of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public contest
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed the local entrepreneur and real estate merchant Lubos.
He had tried to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a request for restitution in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a particular candidate.
This one had to pay Lubos G. half a million kroner.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider trading in the context of a public tender and competition." said for the newspaper Pravo the head of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is under way.
The police released the 46-year-old contractor after 24 hours.
To know how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate in view of so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, the spokesman for the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund said that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
"He was a client and in no way an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land according to the Law on Land" and is set up when several candidates become beneficiaries of rights.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to re-situations which must be settled before the value of the land is announced".
"According to the proposed rights a ranking of the purchasers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights", explained the spokesperson of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information concerning the persons who had registered in the appeal and since he is himself, also, a beneficiary because having bought a large number of rights to restitution, he had offered the candidates on the ground not to participate in the competition.
And he probably cashed in by withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above the standards at the FdT (Fonds des Terrains).
He appeared in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted in criminal proceedings for editing land for which the decision to set up a building had already been published.
For example, Lubos G. had obtained land intended for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the access artery to the Borske Pole industrial zone was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it risked endangering the construction by blocking the land.
Households will pay a supplement of about 100 kroner per month for housing.
From January onwards, households will have to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
From January onwards, families will have to draw up to a hundred crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 per cent, gas by almost 2 per cent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be close to 100 more crowns per year for households in apartments than at present.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices given the significant development in encouraging the manufacture of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at a time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
One can therefore also count a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan the increase in prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 more crowns per month, families in Libérec will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague is preparing an increase of 9 percent for water and sanitation in case the city increases the infrastructure rents.
If rents do not change the Pragois will pay a surcharge of 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest compared to the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are increasing by 7.4 per cent.
Rent prices will increase significantly, for example, in the 450 thousand apartments rented from January onwards, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example the company CPI Byty which owns in Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments, has decided an increase up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by the company.
The regulated rents that people pay in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk with rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts softly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best whisky brand are stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in hospital for re-offending are no exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions from the children's departments of hospitals.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk."
'The trend is really strong alcohols', says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department at Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chip a bottle of daddy's in the closet, it's sometimes about wisky but it's the fernet and vodka that prevail."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so do not feel it," explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman for Motol Hospital, also says so.
"It's usually rum or fernet."
"Today it's fashionable alcohol, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought back from the house," added Jurinova.
According to the Head of Department Pelikan, seeing drunk children between the ages of 13 and 14 in hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he practised for ten years in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the wide, drunk neighborhoods.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times
"She started her career at 12 when she was brought in with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with in addition a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it didn't seem weird to the mother that her daughter was absent for 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the disinterestedness of parents or their extraordinary tolerance for the fact that their offspring drink which is the main cause of the development of alcoholism among children.
According to experts, however, there is no mention of dependence, in its strict sense, on children.
"Under the term alcoholic one hears a chronic dependence on alcohol of several years with all the phenomena that follow from it but which one does not find in children".
"In those who use repeated alcohol, it is rather a socio-familial background that is significantly unfavourable," explained the Head of Department Pelikan.
According to spokesman Jurinova, about forty drunken children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the paediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with acute intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in statistics.
Intoxicated children who are after emergency care taken home by parents or the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pelikan he exsites three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of witches, the saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"If they drink in spite after bad results, on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holiday".
"Of course I lived at the witch's day an admission of 7 drunken children at once," said Pelikan.
The drunk child who spent the night in the hospital in detoxification under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffered the day after the "wooden hog".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better off because they spend an excellent evening then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them".
"They are only amazed where they are," adds Pelikan, knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and intensive care bed hospitalization can reach tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I have applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their drunkenness has cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to pay back a single evening," added Pelikan.
However, in his view, the health insurance companies in their declining management, which should recover care expenses from parents, do not deal with cases of drunken children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, for which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off Tuesday for Seville, Spain, where the manufacturer of Casa-EADS aircraft is based.
This is the first time that aircraft of this type have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
They have, however, been abroad as part of demonstration exercises or flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that were up to now in service in the Czech Army and were in flight condition.
The remaining three devices are single-seater versions of the L-159.
They are currently stationed at Aéro Vodchody and the commercial intermediary - Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of Vodchody's planes is currently unknown.
"The L-159 single-seater aircraft intended for exchange were taken from aircraft that had been stored for a long time without causing additional burdens or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The L-159 T1 two-seaters were exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seaters since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million kroner for the transformation of four unused L-159 single-seaters into two two-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second aircraft scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS has committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
"In the contract it is clearly stated that the one who takes the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used for the training of pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the person who takes into account how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa plane and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion kroons was endorsed last year by the Mirek Topomanek government.
The Ministry of Defence did not tender and contacted EADS directly.
The Defence Directorate argued that the exchange ensures a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aéro Vodchody and uses only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will probably have judicial implications.
the European Commission has nevertheless filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because the planes should have been chosen in the framework of a European-wide tender and in no case by contacting directly a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the annular is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men with a longer index than the ring finger are at lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men under the age of 60," declared the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Great Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had a shorter right hand index than the ring finger.
For them, as for the 19 percent of those with the same length of fingers, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
For those with a longer index than the annular, however, the risk fell to 33 per cent, and for men under age 60, the risk decreased to 87 per cent.
The length ratio of the two mentioned fingers - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is testosterone that helps develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said for TKC that he is aware of this study but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, motorways D1 and D5 are closed.
The Czech Republic like most of Europe is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On roads and sidewalks, there is most of the time compact snow, the clearing machines worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and cars and the road D1 in Brno towards Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher from the Automobile Club Central (UAMK) told the news
At the 91st kilometre a truck was crashed, at the 93rd two lorries struck, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars were also found in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should exit just after Brno at 190 km or go through Brno and then enter at 182 km to Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometers has formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimetres thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, lines of cars are created in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams are lagging behind, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the Prague Crisis Staff still has to meet.
There are also problems with the railways and the airport.
The Czech Railways have already had to eliminate 7 rapid connections due to snow.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
The airport of Ruzyne was closed from Wednesday 11h00 in the night until 5 o'clock in the morning.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but increasing vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impassable, on the road to Brno there are beginning to be snow gusts in places and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass some communication routes in the places above.
The region of Vyskov was one of the most affected areas.
Until now the axes are closed: Rusinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, it may be necessary to send snowmen and snow strawberries.
We can't estimate when they're going to be rollable right now.
On the Hodonin road caution is required in the White Carpathian region.
On roads that are, with regard to the protection of nature, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimetres of snow warns TK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two and 10 centimetres of snow; it fell the most in northern Bohemia, often with up to 18 centimetres of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell up to 15 centimetres of snow.
Snow was gradually disappearing in the Czech Republic.
Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army sent a new "smart" weapon to Afghnistan, known only as code XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" to their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super-precise cannon.
Its projectiles are guided by laser with an accuracy of a few meters.
The special 25 mm calibre ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly breaking explosive, actually works like small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode at the contact of the target but also at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is also not protected from above and when it falls on a deadly rain of steel bursts, it can put it out of combat as well.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtains a precise point of sight, according to which he corrects his site sight and presses the trigger.
"Let's say you shot at 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the weapon loads and shoots at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters," said Audette.
400 off-site jobs
Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently located at the Mareinbader Square office building in the Bad Homburg area.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer manufacturer and maintenance giant said on Wednesday, next July the 400 men's and women's workplace, located so far on the Marienbader Square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße Street in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesperson explained that in the medium term, the group would have to bring together another 100 jobs scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive. Furthermore, Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location with a remarkable infrastructure for us."
He claims that the connection to the airport is of great importance to a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company inside the region yesterday sparked the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again a "global player" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of establishment".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and is an important impetus for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
Management informed the municipality of this intention very early.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our assistance to this company," Korwisi said.
However, friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer vis-à-vis the owner of the Marienbader Square building.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of preventing such an exceptional place from remaining unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu and the nearby "small vertical", as well as the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
The result of a joint project between the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the railway station and the Town Hall. This one attracted many criticism, not only because of the impressive development of the surfaces that used to be used in part as parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment consulting company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Immobilien-Chancen group in Frankfurt bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group is considered to be the third largest supplier of IT products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad. Other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this purpose, 7,000 square meters have been rented out in the Astro Park building.
This 20-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronics and Electrotechnical Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing increasing difficulties.
The Internet service provider Amazon has expelled from its servers the site dedicated to the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may hide political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
Wikileaks founder Assange apparently lives in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is attacked with ever greater force.
The group of cyber-activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a webhost in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, probably stays in Britain, according to news reports published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom", said on Wednesday (local time) the cyber-activists behind the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber-enterprise, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists used Amazon's Web Service (AWS) to reach the largest number of accesses to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now being spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression is a problem for Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The CNN TV channel, citing Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation conducted by Senator Joe Lieberman's staff.
The president of the Senate Commission for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier in view of previous Wikileaks publications of classified information," said the senator.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the platform's use of servers.
"Wikileaks are acting in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous manner, putting our national security at risk and endangering life around the world," according to a statement by the independent senators.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the contents of stolen documents."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to information published by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described Swedish prosecutions against him as intrigues orchestrated by his critics.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson told London that threats have been made against the site.
"Calls have even been made for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is particularly concerned for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was clearly responding to the statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that those responsible for Wikileaks' revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Head of Government Advisor Stephen Harper said on television, ironically, that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for U.S. President Barack Obama, described the fact that Mr.Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton as "ridiculous and absurd" if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," Gibbs says.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the assertions of a website."
The U.S. government is now completely testing the protection of its databases.
According to a statement from the White House, Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Anti-Terrorism Centre, was appointed responsible for the fight against leaks.
Mr Travers is responsible for putting in place "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the whole administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the US government announced that it wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they were ever threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We have made every effort to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the Gelato University in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where's all the ice coming from?
Glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, the somewhat old-fashioned ice confectioner in German, manufactures cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window with a spatula, disposes it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice, can not avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The sherbetières manufacturer founded the Ice University in 2003 to ensure that ice creams released from its machines meet high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses are also offered on chocolate ice cream, which lasts for several days. Practical sessions are also organized in private ice cream shops.
In the middle of the mid-life crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others risk simply fulfilling their ardent desire on smooth ice.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of arts education from California, is a fan of the Slow Food movement. He wants to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial ice.
Anke of Berlin is an advisor in business management and after a few years she wants to draw something singular from this challenging job for nerves.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian maid came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice cream.
Is decisive not only the good flavor, but also the silky flexibility and the good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still keeps a hell of a dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats everything to 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
He then opens a faucet installed on the machine: a pasteurized base white cream, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately assailed with the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can one give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr Luciano cautioned against being misled by the spirit of time.
Those who speak only of ice creams "made from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers in spite of this: most often a natural product, such as guar seed flour obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will chew nothing but ice pellets.
Some changes to the base mass are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with aromas.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit or confectionery department of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to give you dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in fruit sorbets recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it, becomes a yellow cream and, when added cocoa powder, constitutes the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must move on to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice creams: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice creams are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purées: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily have the taste of the nut, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a well-balanced mixture is the taste of ice," says Luciano.
Ice making is a calculation exercise: if you use peach puree with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the winemakers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the calculations easier.
Icemaking no longer requires as much physical intervention as it used to be.
It is not only the machine for the automatic manufacture of the basic mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the available ice mix is simultaneously beaten to make it unctuous and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, minor failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo bathes himself with fruit purée from head to toe and, thus, splashes his fellow students when control of the colossal bowl blender escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that an "incident like this is likely to occur during each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has formed the nucleus of the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the Testbiotech Expert Group, which is considered an independent institute for assessing the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," said Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, in Munich on Wednesday.
There is some information that the Chairman of the Efsa Expert Group on Genetically Modified Plants, Mr Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Elsi Pressure Group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in developing the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The requirements drawn up correspond, by sub-paragraphs, to the positions taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the mark of the industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities established in Parma in Italy.
This is already the second time Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior Efsa official recently joined the Swiss food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period. In so doing, she changed sides.
Not long ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicions from both the German Federal Agency for the Environment and MEPs.
However, the Efsa does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
There is an opinion that all reliable data, including industry data, are being used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Efsa are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi, based in the United States.
This organization sees itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and policy, among others, to assess the risks of biotechnology without being on the payroll of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feed testing in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the impact of genetically modified maize causes in the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If we do not look for risks, how can we then discover them?" asks Mr. Then in an accusatory tone.
That is also Mrs Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been conducting research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic.
In this region, as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
For this reason, there are hardly any researchers who are not related to societies.
In the opinion of companies, the critical studies would not be published.
Ms Hilbeck said that "industry controls safety research".
The Stone Trace
Uli Gsell obtained it, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart railway station with her tube on her back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: By September, the excavators had come and started to demolish much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people protested against the S21 project, the transformation of the central station of Stuttgart into an underground station which will cost several billions.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations resulted in a stop to construction work.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (coquillary limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement badly constructed between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor residing in Ostfildern.
He got a few fragments of it.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically declared: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and earthly."
He claimed that by cutting it by the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he'll do with this fragment yet.
Rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
traces of Stuttgart stones lead to a former ammunition depot of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappeared in the dump," he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He says he was insulted and threatened when in September newspapers reported that he had purchased the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to keep using the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project later took one of the stone parallelepiped weighing an average of 80 kilos with a value of between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir in while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half is still piled up in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came from everywhere and took away everything that could enter the trunk and trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or into limitations of grass beds.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"had not been this political component."
He enters his all-terrain car, goes around his vast 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and later began studying biology before becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a carrier.
And a stone lover.
It stores 40,000 tons.
It collects treasures all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest merchant of ancient stones.
He's repressing.
Artfully carved sandstones are laid on the snow.
"Once upon a time, they were part of the bridge of Marienbrücke in Dresden".
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he says enthusiastically.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
It shows a heap of the finger: Red sandstone, formerly, part of Karlsruhe railway station.
And so on.
"Joli travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from the Cathedral of St Blasian, the tuff from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thought that the stones were once hand-carved and moved with simple hoists and carts pulled by oxen, he became completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a patrimony were to be set apart."
He didn't get rich, let alone rich.
But today this carrier employs 14 people. In addition, stone tailors, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's rewarding," says the waste recycler.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There, too, there are stones to save.
Fighting talent to conquer high potentials
There's a lot of traffic in the counter.
16 students rushed to buy salmon loaves, tomato sauce and white food.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen car manufacturer invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a kind of competition of ideas, they have to talk business about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen firm.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go to the competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most gifted graduates as far as possible in the amphitheatre before they enter the labour market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify exceptional talents in the framework of practical projects and to retain them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automotive group amasses the talents.
A young lady from the staff department shares pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs for young talent; she shows them the paths to reach the group's premises.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, it can know the students, take a closer look at the serious candidates and appreciate those who take into account as a collaborator."
According to Mr. saddle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive we're trying to attract students with.
"In the past, the focus was more on the professional project," says Mr. Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much tougher.
In many sectors, companies are no longer able to recruit their employees by sorting out a pool of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and above all woo the highly skilled workforce.
It is mainly graduates from engineering disciplines who find themselves in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineering association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the gap in engineering positions will widen further.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, audit firm, accounting and consulting firm.
It organises expensive events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the United States in this way.
Participants can also visit KPMG's subsidiaries and know the company.
The person who must participate in the selection process shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to search for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the pack thanks to the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little."
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the count seems to be there.
"Until today, we have been in contact with all those who took part last year in a similar action."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to address their requests to our company soon," he says.
Apart from the direct leaning on the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are proceeding in a very classic way by participating in professional fairs where they hunt for brains.
"We try to reach the graduates by participating in trade shows."
"For example, at the solar technology fair," says Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This Bonn-based company employs about 1,500 people in Germany.
Ms Stübe is aware of the problem of succession.
Currently, 35 positions are put to the competition on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It's expensive and takes a lot of time," he says.
Another way to make contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Freiburg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to do work placements or to write his or her graduation project at home."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often a large group can't do that," says Chief of Staff Stübe.
It has been a long time since money has played the leading role in job search.
The other determining factors are flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among Germany's top 100 employers.
The Institute is an annual honour table for German employers.
To this end, he asks employees about their level of satisfaction with their work and its context, while looking at the employee's framework conditions.
Chief of Staff Ms Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the company's image among job seekers.
"I think the candidates rely mainly on external assessments for a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German DEBA Academy (Deutscher Employee Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means, above all, taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to make himself attractive is through his own employees," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand within its own workforce.
"satisfied collaborators train the best messengers."
When people treat their employees well and identify with the company, they themselves advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," says Kriegler.
Obama Stops New Oil Drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, the southeastern state of the United States, in the coming years.
The Washington government has imposed a ban An equivalent ban and, thus, definitively annulled its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the time being.
Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
The explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig is the reason for this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of this accident, which cost the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this industry, indicated that he was prepared to allow further drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in golf has not been definitively resolved to date.
The British oil group, which is facing billions of claims for compensation, is at the centre of the charges.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling freeze decreed after the platform explosion.
As a result of this decision, various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster with stricter controls and stricter security instructions.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited after numerous accusations of corruption, is currently undergoing extensive reform.
At the same time, Obama announced that they would remove the lucrative tax niches of gas and oil companies.
Stakeholders in this industry are now publicly warning that feed flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's objective is to curb the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector" according to the results of a current survey conducted in the sector by the BDO audit firm, before the drilling ban pronounced on Wednesday.
Indeed, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows what will change exactly with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing through the rivers is brown oiled; it emits a smell similar to that in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live on theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't wear yourself out," the environmental activist said to journalists to calm them down: "You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man in the muddy water to the chest, as well as the greasy trail that surrounds him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the glow of water in the color of the rainbow.
It cannot be seen that the basement is full of brown tables of crude oil.
On the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells us that she used to collect shrimp by whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil came out of a pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the small nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The full extent of the ravages is evident when traversing mangrove marshes through streams.
Instead of a clear water, the motorboat splits a brown cradish water. Anyone who dips his hand there removes it all covered with oil.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the soil like liquorice sticks. Isolated palms sadly allow their palms to hang.
We seek in vain the clouds of birds, as we usually encounter in wetlands: As soon as the outboard motor stops, a ghostly silence falls on this paradise of old which looks like a gas station by the smell it emits.
"What is happening here is war on the environment," says Celestine Akpobari with a sad look: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger in terms of health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The Ogoni region has been under siege for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. The latter was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the return to the Ogoni country is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometers of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are unexploited, because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
Every few hundred meters stand in the water of steel tretals like strange sculptures: We very affectionately refer to "Christmas trees" the heads of boreholes.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are rodents by corrosion to the marker.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time in pieces, as a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion litres have been spilled into the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that occurred in the sea during the accident of the super-oil tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the largest environmental catastrophes in human history.
Who should bear the responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, the sabotage and siphoning of pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists consider the blasts of boreholes and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, US researcher Richard Steiner criticized the Shell Group for applying essentially lower safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of pipe failure is "always higher than the number of people in the world."
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of junk and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with junk to the neck.
A fire shimmers under one of the many barrels that sometimes connect to the pipes, sometimes scattered without motive on the site must be repeated: a small underground refinery.
We heat the crude oil in the barrel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
Initially, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then at the end of the kerosene drop pipe, and diesel is finally obtained.
For example, Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-litre diesel barrels every day: "It pays us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
Delta residents benefit from the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a lower price than the ridiculously low price of barely 40 euro cents per litre of Diesel: because they acquire their raw material free of charge.
This is offered by the "protectors" who drill the pipeline network throughout the Ogoni country. According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil in the Niger Delta as a whole.
Only a small and insignificant part of the raw material temporarily stored is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include politicians and high-ranking military personnel, charge the lion's share in tankers and rob it in the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers that the debate about whether to attribute environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or to the lax mode of production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and the basics of fishermen's lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries."
But in the meantime, Ogoni's relations, especially vis-à-vis Shell, have deteriorated so much that it was only a matter of withdrawal from the group. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will prove to be better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you got out of here," announces the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers mainly from the north intend to enjoy the raw material like all Nigerians.
"In any case, this damn thing has brought down our country," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 is clearly suffering from a major safety problem.
Examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "disaster failure of the reactor."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas had obviously been more fortunate so far: In the course of its investigation, the Australian Aviation Safety Authority found that the reactors of certain A380 aircraft presented a serious safety problem, and warned against a possible construction defect.
This potential failure could have serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of the oil pipe, it is said in a statement published this Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a "disaster failure of reactors".
This applies to reactors manufactured Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 A380 series aircraft.
The Quantas airline, which had to land urgently on 4 November in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now brought legal action against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, giving her the opportunity to take further legal action against society.
Quantas' manager, Alan Joyce, stated that his company would claim damages for the incident at the beginning of November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, the damage is caused by the ignition of oil.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos which are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered to be of sufficient importance to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his aircraft, the Quantas airline had grounded its entire A380 fleet for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily detained three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa replaced, as a precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-storey aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall across the territory causes chaos in transport
All-white Germany: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany blush: By freezing temperatures, almost the whole republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimetres in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On National A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff worked on a permanent basis, but they were unable to cope with the snow that was constantly accumulating.
In addition, violent gusts swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Marine Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal waves to take place on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow piles on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the Weather Alert Center Meteomedia announced the violet alert level was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In some places, it fell 30 centimetres of fresh snow that the strong and cool winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars remained stuck there at night.
Even in the Saxonland-Anhalt, the police authorities have announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On Highway A2, snow and wind caused traffic to stop and traffic to stop.
In Thuringia, snowfall hit highways A4 and A9.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions in rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, trees fallen on railways, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, the inter-regional transport between Leipzig and Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train with blankets, food and beverages.
Snow winds swept the roads.
Snowfalls have led to numerous flight cancellations at Germany's main airports.
According to a spokesperson for the standard and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesperson for Fraport reports that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides permanent service.
It is true that there are no more passengers stuck at the airport, despite which only 400 beds are made available.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Because of the snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a crossing because the vehicle was immobilised there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car rolled on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists report good news: The snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will swirl in case of slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by strong and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, up to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to newspaper reports, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could bring in up to 500 million euros.
The Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group's headquarters: The twin towers located in the Business District have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group is clearly seeking to recover the renovation costs and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper Financial Times Deutschland writes, citing a spokesperson.
This spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we check whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or to sell them, and to lease them again later".
Thus, the largest financial institution in Germany has already given up its seat shortly thereafter.
It was only in the middle of 2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for an amount of 272 million euros from the equity holders and then rehabilitated them.
The transformations aimed at energy optimisation have swallowed up, according to some indications, about 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector estimate the value of the towers, renamed in the meantime "Green Towers", at around 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesperson, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the miners who have perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of buried miners who were declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
The bodies had not yet been able to be raised because the security situation of the disaster well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the disaster well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue team was able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that minors no longer had any chance of surviving.
Until now the bodies could not be reassembled.
Today, parents and friends organized a party in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people gathered under a bright sun in Greymouth, south of New Zealand Island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried miners, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and belongings, including clothes and surfboards, were also included.
The flags were half-masted in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the commemorative party that New Zealand has nurtured the hope that miners will rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the pits said that he cannot resign himself to accepting his son's death until he sees his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
Minors of South African and British origin also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
First aid workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police Commissioner Gary Knowles told reporters that when explosive gas masses are displaced, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter film an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the old genre thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising", epic of the fighter.
What kind of audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of by turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal murder methods. When he is in a bad mood, he rips out the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to be dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the blind man doesn't say a word about his real name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, the detour of one or two sentences some terrible cries of agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and we celebrate in Scotland's incredibly beautiful mountain landscape, which is the setting of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travel.
When a film targets more than one target group, it is a pity that the target groups are mutually exclusive.
Since the release of "Pusher", director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish Quentin Taratnon, his trilogy about the fierce and styled drug dealer, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to the art and essay cinema.
Most art film sympathizers must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and the intestines.
The amateurs of action films die of boredom, when the one-eyed ship embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any distributor of films in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that have deserved some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not about dialogues in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
The viewer cannot escape it.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with icy images and a gloomy soundtrack, but above all with an elusive hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who faithfully stands beside the blind, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the blind hero whose motives are never known, but who comes back from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning himself into a warrior, is perhaps sent from the devil himself.
It represents decay, but perhaps also, just for those who are, in any case, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, with the aim of annoyance, enthusiasm and astonishment.
It's a traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications for a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, let alone submit to the Agency's controls.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007, around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest town nearby is located at 30 kilometers: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in IAEA documents, because it refers to the reactor that Syria apparently built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a U.S. intelligence briefing, the CIA, dating back to the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby town of al-Kibar, would be well-suited to produce plutonium, which would allow the manufacture of atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with fuzzy satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each reactor component prior to the destruction of the plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building in the vicinity or even the interior of it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be commissioned, but was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, we have barely more information than at the time, and even with time the mystery is getting thicker and thicker.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor at al-Kibar, but had little evidence showing that country was developing "an active nuclear weapons program".
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "summary reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation to be "plausible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as at the IAEA.
When asked how he made sure that he was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior diplomat from the United Nations gave only a laconic response in the summer, claiming that the IAEA had "sufficient documentation to ask questions".
The Syrians have certainly hastily removed the rubble of the "unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical flattening of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of uranium produced by men in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite imagery from commercial providers through a Member State showing the moment that directly followed the attack. It seems that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity in an objective manner.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret atomic programme and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found on the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the particle analysis, calling it improbable.
Since then, damas has refused to discuss this, as well as satellite images.
Moreover, Syria does not allow the monitors to carry out a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and refuses access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel remains stubbornly silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
For example, the investigation into this case has been slow since June 2008 without a result being achieved and is becoming "an increasingly serious problem of the Agency's credibility", as recognized by a high-ranking Western diplomat serving at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, and ultimately a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the other three facilities which must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities they are dealing with here, what their function is or what they are suspected of being contained.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also by the names of the neighbouring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C., has identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that is most likely one of the suspected objects.
It is possible that it is located in or directly adjacent to a military base; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to IAEA inspectors at all three sites.
In Vienna, it is claimed that Syrians fear that the inspection group is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that attracts the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have shuttled between the three sites and the stone parallelepipede to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat stated in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serve to fuel production".
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities", such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works with unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible assumptions about the following fundamental questions: where uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed to make the bomb would have been separated later.
It is not known whether the rubble, which could hide high-value traces, has been stored at all three sites.
Once the hundreds of trucks loaded with land have disappeared, no one will have information about the place where the rubble is stored.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometres from al-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River, examined in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
In a recent analysis of satellite photographs taken on behalf of the famous Jane's Intelligence Review, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked them to the reactor in question.
Satellite photographs show, however, that Syria undertook earthmoving work at the three suspect sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began to demand access to these locations.
It may be a coincidence, but it did not help to rule out suspicions.
In diplomatic circles, he said that the IAEA had spent several months drawing up a plan for the inspections to be carried out there, which was intended to allow Syria to preserve any military secrets. Only the time invested shows how much interest the inspectors have in this matter.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported in this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the United States ambassador who has been talking for a few months about what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The IAEA Director, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitant.
This means there is a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives to reflect: "To this it will serve, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in Time of War
It's been bad since Angelina Jolie made her summer debut as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it is a story of love between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything more about this story, but it's enough to cause discomfort.
There is persistent rumour that the Muslim woman fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the Yugoslavian war.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested. In response, some filming footage planned for Sarajevo was moved to Hungary at the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organisation of women victims of war sent correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet the actress. Jolie is herself a goodwill ambassador of UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she offered these women a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must take place in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario tells a lot about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended that the United Nations High Commission withdraw the status of Goodwill Ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, by the way, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, granted a filming permit in Sarajevo after some hesitation, but it is not known why it did not come after that.
The young author assures herself that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a great deal of effort that she has learned about the Yugoslav conflict. She maintains that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give all the interested parties the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: Lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is still a big difference with the version "a rape victim is in love with her executioner".
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, as Jolie says, is "unjust and based on erratic information".
From now on, only Hollywood fanatics can give him peace: By illegally putting this scenario on the Net, like many others before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, everything is going well again among the Irish.
No sign of consternation.
This is why the local team overly dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy against a background of strong music, they trip feet.
Cork Baileyu-Pub in southern Ireland vibrates because the players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in beer cups of the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong". The winner picks up 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to attend in January in Las Vegas at the world beer-pong championship.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the tremorous question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his plans. In January, he will lead job interviews in New Zealand.
"I have a strange feeling though," he says.
"The country of birth is so far away and I don't have a job there."
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as event manager, maybe a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Due to the bleak prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, and his brother Colin is now a computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts at the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even expect 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are made, it will be a flow of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish have enjoyed great ease, sorrow is now taking its place.
The economic crisis, however, affects mainly the well-trained young people in Ireland, who have had only moments of happiness so far.
The loss of employment and social loss seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's money in excess.
In the meantime, however, three out of every ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times publishes extensively the letters from readers written by young emigrants who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes adrift."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the possibilities, goes away and our country so a whole generation."
"The last one to leave the light goes out."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future coming because the government is just throwing powder in the eye and offering young people no prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades cling to one unpaid practicum to another.
She says that her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to address this theme positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" trade show, which offers comprehensive support on the theme "Working Abroad".
"But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," the manager says.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a mess, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was nothing more to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector and Germany.
A fashion house just came out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his native country, as he participates in an additional workstation, in order to be able to complete the repayment of the credit contracted to build his home in the native country.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I hardly live."
He bursts with an embarrassed laugh as he crosses the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars from large brands are parked on access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, 100 percent financed by the credit.
"These were moments of madness, without a doubt, money was easy," he says.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse because of credit?
O'Donovan reflects for a moment, stirs up hot tea and says, "I have no children to care for and I am young; even everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The building engineer doesn't like the lamentations he's been hearing lately.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as dramatic as we once experienced here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe it's what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and in Ireland, life simply went on."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future and discover how life is happening elsewhere.
In his record, He already has a few years of work in London. That's why life in New Zealand shouldn't be as easy for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that worries him well in recent days: the celebration to be held on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's worried she won't be able to turn into a farewell party.
"Only, not a lot of emotion," he said, drinking a long sip of beer.
"Good-bye, it seems disturbing."
"Let's call it a good-bye night, all relaxed, bringing together some friends, some drinks and some games."
Democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the most recent Latinobarómetro poll in 18 countries published exclusively by The Economist.
Given that the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it tracks attitudinal changes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from this year's survey conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after experiencing a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase out of the 25% in 2001 (Chart 3)
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but up sharply compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shook support for democracy.
While this continued during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have suffered only a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say that they or someone close to them have been the victims of an indictable crime in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela agree (and 80% support private enterprise); although their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private enterprises.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, reported by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the disaster-stricken and fearful country.
Poll boxes and a new ballot were introduced, ballots were dispersed in the gutter, polling stations were ransacked and intimidation was reported.
The polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced as a result of the January earthquake, were wandering around to find where to vote.
Some of them ended up giving up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favourites, denounced the fraud and called for the annulment of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, considers the event as "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they “did not believe that such irregularities, however serious they may be, had necessarily invalidated the process”.
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no visible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second round, reaches the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, there was concern that participation would be possible.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, necessary for voting, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are important.
Donors see the election of a legitimate people's government as an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And so, it's clear, Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the toes towards the center
In the weeks after she suddenly became a widow, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, received a wave of sympathy from the public which improved her approval rate by 20 points, to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on Mrs Fernández's choice, apparently in mourning, that she would abandon or not the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, was used to preparing budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has fallen into disarray following Mr Kirchner's death from a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian struck one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to fight," said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, giving the President even more flexibility to spend at will.
The economy is overheating widely: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and union wage demands, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, he harassed the private sector and purged INDAC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by high world prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the boost to growth following a strong devaluation in 2002.
That is perhaps why Mrs Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the government concluded an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled its maturities in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be developing towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve surveillance by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index; which looks like a prelude to the consolidation of INDAC.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term of office, now that her husband is no longer with her.
If she does, she needs to gain support from the middle class, among whom Kirchnerism is highly advocated.
When the Argentinians return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have refluted.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether to repudiate many of her husband’s policies without any noise.
Half a horra for China
Taiwanese voters are moving towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its older brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million electors ran on November 27, 70% of eligible voters, to elect mayors and municipal councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings about the continent, having forged innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the greatest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) won three of the five mayors, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (DPP), which leaned towards Taiwan's full independence, won nearly 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including rough country trucks and mass gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal dress.
A mandatory mysterious assassination attempt was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, Honorary President of the KMT, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Oddly enough, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences for the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Maybe the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking that the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates have joined the plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its links with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from fuelling the anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, sought confirmation as to whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let's start from the beginning.
It is better to wait for this to happen after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, he was ill: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur in favour of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under Ms. Tsai's leadership, and the PDP is making every effort to attract professionals and youth.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party presents a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that the PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic man, not to run for the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will find it difficult to choose between its potential candidates.
The KMT has to do a self-introspection.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite staggering economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A spokesperson for the KMT said that his office and its local branches would be reorganized.
The PDP's good results suggest that Taiwan's support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Awards Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
Carry out at the request of a president, and people are required to read it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer handpicked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the Grammy Awards surprises this year with a large-scale nomination in the "Best New Artist" category.
Considering Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the Grammy Awards rules according to which an artist must not release more than three albums before the recording; which "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skilful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line at Spalding compared to Norah Jones' brilliant success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Award voters by taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy Award voters have rightly honoured Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "instrumental album" category, a trip on an invigorating thrill of a recording that was one of the top favorites last year.
Among these Iyers, "Moody 4B" of veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of keyboardist John Beasley will notably compete.
Trombone Shorty, a favorite in the raucous New Orleans voice and frequent guest at HBO's "Treme", has been honoured in the contemporary jazz category; which is also strongly inclined towards a definite fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, won some well-deserved recognitions in the grand ensemble category; in competition with Billy Childs Ensemble's rich chamber-jazz and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his byte's live was a fine example of this bassist's democratic hand as a band leader.
Grammy Awards nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classical nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from all over the world.
Top of the nominations are Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No.4, "Los Angeles", a work commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also competing for an award.
The classical appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classical album are the Symphonys No. 3 and 4 by Bruckner of the Royal Orchestra of the Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - l'art des Castrati" featuring various artists; and the "Requiem" by Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg's "Lulu" from the Royal Opera House Orchestra, Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" from Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the Orchestra and the Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition count Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
The "Mandolin Concerto" by Dorman was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he had written the 15-minute work especially for the performer at the Avi Avital mandolin, which performed the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of ranges and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, was appointed to the orchestra performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received a nomination were pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalist-solist nominees: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixtures, soprano Jessie Norman received a nomination for her recording "Racines: ma vie, ma chanson"
The Temecula mosque project is approved by the planning commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics attacked the project by claiming that it promoted both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But the commissioners ruled on Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you mention him," said Hadi Nael, President of the Temecula Valley Islamic Centre, speaking Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it, as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight, with, most of the time, people voting for or against the centre, speaking time roughly equally distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including the Ground Zero, the site of the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 families has co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years, but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a property shared with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24.943 square foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would be composed of two minarets and would be 43 feet high.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents may still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
An arsenic tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, widens the field to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has opportunities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organization has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or arsenic."
"That's why it's very special, even though it's far from being a truly "foreign" life form," commented Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday's online edition of Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacterium, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We wonder what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
Discovery is important in the search for life beyond the Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not divulge the details of the finding, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could divulge the discovery of an alien life.
This was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms may be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute for Planetary and Spatial Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element for another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; for example, it speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to substitute for each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behaviour is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms find it difficult to distinguish these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and, in a way, erases the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
Researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea, that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of the Earth's existence, she says; for example, researchers hypothesized that early life forms could have used it.
This suggests that there may be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at first," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs were found in Compton
The other two exhibition dogs on four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, and the Los Angeles County sheriffs announced it Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two akitas and two Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower motel 6, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the evening on Wednesday, told Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is dogs are fine," Whitmore says.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say precisely where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood and in what circumstances they had been discovered.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
Dog owners Kristina Rickard and David Peek could not be contacted to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were safe and sound, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of Japanese dog owners, were missing until their discovery on Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the national champion "AKC/Eukanuba" of Long Beach, where they planned to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba", Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the couple's nearly a month-long dog show tour.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked the motel.
They often stay in the motels and park their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell burrow and a Breton spaniel - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so that the dogs could have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM waits for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York, on Thursday officially praised the plan "pre-packaged" by creditors that about $5 billion of the debt would be erased; paving the way for the entertainment company, having 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With Thursday's decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no legal obstacles remain before MGM to recover under the tutelage of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general directors of what will be a light studio.
Staff will be reduced to approximately 320 out of 400 on departure.
MGM will not really move from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase enters into a $500 million credit facility to finance the new operations and productions of MGM.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which is itself up to $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to place its finances as it could not afford to pay the interest of $300 million per year.
In August, Executive Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in recovery known for his work at Krispy Krame Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the studio's more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the additional $2 billion sought by creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be redone as the MGM team began to work on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially emerged from bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper received multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have raised $375,000 a month for their corporate management services, will receive a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum intend to revive the production of MGM, which has released only one film this year, and to create an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros.
The studio has to make a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to fund its share in these two films, which must be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM's debt, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful toy is the IPAD, followed perhaps by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make a significant breach in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic beads jumping strings, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technology toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best-known ones, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button battery toys are increasing, as are rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years or more) are stuffed toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when you squeeze them on their stomach.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second one is used to compose a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start pressing, you can no longer stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years or more) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can perform lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you're a 1980s child, you'll remember Alphie, one of the first computer-based educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a backpack filled with quiz game cards designed to turn a drive into a session with a self-correction and a valve binder.
If you are suspicious when your child is holding your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for the 3 to 8 year olds) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games don't educate as efficiently as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for the 3 to 12 year olds), this is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL ($90, for ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-type system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card entry to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a match box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing blocks online before the time runs out, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
More and more, toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest ones are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6 to 12 year olds) that includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credit at the Club Penguin store for two items of choice.
These can be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the tip of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years or more) is the latest button-pile micro-robot.
The false bug moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pasta in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It's also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage through our dog's mouth.
Bringing a softer side to the maintenance of order in China
Tang Shenbin walked a square in the city as an urban trainer by rigorously inspecting his nerve loads, issuing orders in a low voice with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan - imposing officials of public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and their inclination for violence - to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"Just stand right!"
"Be piercing!"
Show them, he said, "What do pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely spent their teens in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-colored jackets and pants, froze at your attention.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned to the ruler.
Four neat hats perfectly perched on top of hair tied by a blue and white striped knot.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, scornfully.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a higher education diploma.
Guangdong Province exchanged grey-green uniforms for a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced the lower-eyes with the strong way:: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black glances, firmly for half an hour, until the colporteur packed his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in urban areas with 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, shape and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have trouble drawing attention to this underground urban brigade of China.
And for good reason, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media portray the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei province inspectors beat an observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and put online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without bloodshed.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon hawker was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained in assaulting street vendors.
"Chengguan marked the government," lamented China Daily, a national publication last year, after an umpteenth controversy about tactics.
The newspaper called for "a complete clean-up."
The skeptics say that the approach is far from it.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had any real jobs or whether they were merely tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district announcement required female candidates, between the ages of 18 and 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five facial features in the right order."
They must be larger than the average size of 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
The officers stated that the work was physically too difficult for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First of all, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are appropriate: height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities."
Chengguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not agree with this description.
But he noted that the height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement relative to the order of the facial features.
That it means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, disabled or disfigured persons must not apply.
"We can't let a lame person or a hunchback come and serve here," says Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who is patrolling on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheeked cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the presentation of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in that uniform?" she asked disillusionedly.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old colleague with dimples, says: "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They did not object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they had greater career ambitions than simply chasing sellers into the alleys where they were supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen walking merchants who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many rolls or bowls of tofu as possible before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you have to leave."
"We've already told you several times!" said Mrs. Xu as a salesman fled on foot, temporarily abandoning her noodle cart bike.
Officers describe their duties as monotonous rather than arduous.
"It's about the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the sellers' property.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rebelled after the spread of false rumours that chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen chengguan policemen and agents were injured, 14 government vehicles were hit or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from placid Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
The officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the motorbike was shouting at the scandal.
A 15-minute arm of iron followed before the police officers, with their sinister faces, crossed their way to their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men 40 years of age or older - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li Said in a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the audience that starts."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Department of Justice lifted criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, arising from a case involving an assistant in an old campaign and his efforts to obtain lobbying work for the wife's husband, said the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision put an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr.Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal around his case did national headlines last year and harmed his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" by the decision, the result of a one-year investigation.
The honourable senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Counsel for Mr.Ensign stated that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer under investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this matter."
The Department of Justice has refrained from commenting on this issue.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who claimed that there was significant evidence that Mr. Ensign had conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr.Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative lobbying to win the silence of Mr.Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's case with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as treasurer in an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator with Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for a year by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
The ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seemed to contradict the so-called ban on the rotating door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that was released, "there appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and materially violate the revolving door law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of a government investigation.
Although the departmental judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the Ensign decision, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department appeared to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of high-level setbacks to its Public Integrity Section, including last year's decisions to drop the prosecution of former Senator Ted Stevens for lack of prosecution.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms," said Melanie Sloan, Director General of Citizens for Accountability and Ethics in Washington, D.C., an advocacy group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basicly says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's senior counsel, stated in an interview that on Monday he had received a telephone call from a Department of Justice prosecutor and a follow-up the following day, telling him that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr.Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed on Wednesday in a press release, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the Public Prosecutor's Office.
"I'm not comfortable getting into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that Mr. Ensign's payment of $96,000 to the Hamptons violated the federal election law.
The electoral commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr.Ensign helped Mr.Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "marteling" the Ministry of the Interior on an issue in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Mr. Hampton in lobbying.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr.Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as fourth-ranked Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for several months, Mr.Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr.Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, stated that the honourable senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were knocking away in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent every minute reports of horrible testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said that there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape trial and the children tied to their beds in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence with the court that outlines appellate arguments, which may be occupying the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reports on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - have created a "circuit atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury has been poorly influenced by the passions of the public.
The request could prompt appeal judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experienced this in this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms is a violation of human rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the State Superior Court, laconically rejected the claims in last week's judgment, claiming that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
Courts of appeal have for decades recognized that media coverage of well-known cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 judgment, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his decision that there was a "carnaval atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The fugitive".
Some lawyers have stated that the appeal courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules may be needed to manage the means of communication in the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue argues that some appellate judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could lead to fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is but one of many described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, which is likely to be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defence counsel also argued, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have been prejudiced when Blue J. refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, age 48, and her daughters, Hayley, age 17, and Michaela, age 11.
Defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unfairly evicted one of the jurors, who had been criticized before prosecutors, and that he improperly put pressure on a verdict by making the unusual decision to get the jury to deliberate in one weekend.
The jurors weren't kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was being discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media were constantly fanning the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily jostling of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "did not look like anything that had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion that instant news was more incendiary than press releases delivered more slowly was a luddist view that would impoverish the Court's policy governing media coverage of future trials.
However, some lawyers stated that appeal courts were often attracted by arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their file, they refer to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility bring cleavages closer together?
After a campaign marked by invectiveness and negativity, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is it a warning sign of genuine bipartite cooperation forwards or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders produced no breakthroughs on the major issues to be addressed during the "Limp Duck" session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides and the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
Wednesday's public meeting of the committee on the President's deficit was just as civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological divide, but which still divides the members.
This is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a period of trial and mutual testing with a view to obtaining signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voters' patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxation, spending, health care or rights, both parties stay miles away.
However, the November election moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now alongside the Center for Ethical and Public Policy.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
The elections arouse partisan passions and then they fade away.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the "Limp Duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of them, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise can be envisaged on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, there was more optimism about a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "Limp Duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warned that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "lame duck" session would not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress would meet in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
"Once the things that have to be done are done, psychology in the short term will come back to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared scepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present at the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Committee on the Deficit, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, raising the retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their view, imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the committee, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had difficulty reaching that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected representatives, suggesting that there are few reasons or willingness to compromise on tax matters, at least today.
Galston is planning two phases in the fighting between the White House and Congressional Republicans.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan confrontations, given that the Republicans are challenging Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care; and then be followed by a period of greater bipartite cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will closely observe the reaction of the public.
Whoever is judged to be in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a larger election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But much more effort will be needed on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
American documents leaked describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and passes to the Kremlin some of the bribes and protection money it collects, the US Embassy in Russia reported in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service carry out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of power" - takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but there have been few clean-up traces since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the accusations of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation suits on these charges.
In September, he told a Russian TV channel when he was asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's to throw away, it's anything."
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy report; and it is unheard of that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to name it "dysfunctional" and to say that the government functioned more like a kleptocracy than a government," according to the embassy's note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means "roof" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through all the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts to identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a void in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB is brewing money from the largest companies and that the police are targeting the smaller ones.
One source, he said, "explained that business owners in Moscow understood that it was better to obtain the protection of the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high."
The note notes that although the collection of money is extended, protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev referred several times to the fight against corruption but admitted the lack of progress.
The embassy's note transmits reports of men bringing suitcases, probably full of money, to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview with Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank Indem" in Moscow.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"He is not a member of a political class because there are no political classes in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to Indem, the cost of corruption is estimated to be more than $300 billion a year across Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the note of the American embassy, which was only carried out yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will stir with certainty discontents within the Russian government; although Luzhkov can be blamed, to some extent, for the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is solving the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that WikiLeaks documents could be manufactured and reacted with anger to the statements that US diplomats had leaked by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem lies in the fact that this is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he says.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that it would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, as you know, in opposition to ethics."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with poor quality concrete walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School evoked the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves your Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as the "butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in north-west Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook there which, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly run with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence for a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing to 35 years in prison the former head of Tuol Sleng's notorious torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
In the face of these developments, anxiety has increased among the Khmer Rouge ex-combatants in Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of Cambodia's Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation creates divisions within families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and toppled Pol Pot's government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurgency that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrillas at their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a suite at Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defectionate the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the Khmer Rouge ex-combatants have sunk into black poverty, common to rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic about the movement.
Although some of the top Khmer Rouge officers retained their positions as local leaders in exchange for laying down their arms, they are unqualified farmers with low rank and file.
"These people received very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbued with the regime's agrarian utopian ideology."
"They were raised in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to provide for ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Court has also caused concern here.
At the beginning of next year, the court is expected to start the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Red Minister.
The court's mandate is to try the senior leaders and the main perpetrators of the crimes, but it did not say whether it was continuing beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation turned to Im Chaem, 64 years old, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers were reportedly killed.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from work to the field near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
While the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court called her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said.
"If there's more prosecution, there'll be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, of the documentation centre.
"The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect broken pieces," he says.
"We need to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, "A 75-page history of democratic Kampuchea."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history textbooks of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, Anlong Veng's youth know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They're suspicious because they don't know exactly how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful atrait here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a path, invaded by weeds and dotted with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside mobile phone saleswoman, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and, later that day, she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its stockpile of military-grade uranium
Belarus's government announced on Wednesday that it will abandon its stock of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide.
The agreement was disclosed in a joint statement issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the margins of a security summit.
The US government had tried for years to convince Belarus to renounce highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But US officials told Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarus research centre.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the £500 issue, according to a staff member who raised the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to provide an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves to me that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton described the agreement as a "very significant, important step" made by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, the Belarusian President, Alexander Lukashenko, declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and low-enriched uranium," said Lukashenko.
"It's our product... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're just going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus moved closer to the United States a few months ago; however, it showed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the equipment had been lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that travelled more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and disposed of, said officials.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by air, according to officials.
The US government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"Comprehensive coordination and organization has been put in place to build confidence," leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the Energy Department specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates from the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of kilos of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint declaration.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential to improving bilateral relations and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has not raised any objections to CIA flights.
The government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda towards Guantanamo across Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the United States ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks in the daily El País, who add that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed in order "to demonstrate that they were exercising adequate vigilance on foreign planes that crossed Spain".
In June 2006, after a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights practices, a meeting was held between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "surprised the Zapatero Government off-the-go" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega pointed out that Spain has no objection to intelligence thefts over Spanish territory."
"They only want to be informed" to avoid being "taken unawares," Aguirre relates in a cable.
The incumbent of the Ministry of External Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the Ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lower profile possible, even though, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
In turn, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless shown its concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of CNI o of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between the independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly manipulate the case between the Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, during a luncheon between US Ambassador Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba and Internal Affairs Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even though Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid the comments of a burning rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's action in this matter.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the United States Government," she says.
The parricide that passed to the confession complained in network of the "accident" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Galician error"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname which she uses as soon as she was small, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; the two natives of Noia, the village of Coruña from which she originated.
Messages are from 2008.
To hear them, one must know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of his parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old Galician girl started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Soon after they broke up, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
Another new boyfriend was discovered shortly after that.
The chosen was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labour market, the boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, we hear that their idyll broke apart, they separated.
In March 2008 she was in Menorca, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and upset for the fact that I came to work there."
"When I told him, it seemed a good thing to him, but of course, he is now aware of what it means to be with the child all day long and not to have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she talks about a mobile message she just got: "I want you to come home this month or you give me an address to send the child to you."
Ella complains: "If she doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home," she claims.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "This week I am leaving, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to go to a job not to lose it".
She explains that if everything was fine, she would have taken her elder with her.
"He will remain with the correct person, i.e. with me, and I will never leave him in my life with another person if that person is not my mother", doubtful intention, taking into account their bad relations.
In July, there's another post.
When she typed him, it was assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and who had allegedly been murdered on the 10th, died.
"César is happy on one side, but he is not happy on another."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes this place a little bit, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Majorca.
"He will go there (the child) a few hours in summer and so I save a little money from the babysitter".
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you'll come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to the email, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is good, and goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money".
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of hers in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Galician error (epigrapher)".
The last man who lived with her, guard, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything had gone so that she hadn't told him that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the Palma Provincial Prison yesterday, coming from the Minorca Judicial Detainees Centre.
The ex officio lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the facts happened, "and she also had no intention of harming the minor."
Before she confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and putting his corpse in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric trial.
Members of the Popular Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9 seats.
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the large increase in votes and deputies recorded in the last autonomic elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this group obtains in these comices normally doubles that which it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan people obtained 610.473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomics they obtained 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384.091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, which is desired by the diversion of votes from the PSC and the retention of the PP electorate, the analysts of this formation have calculated that, if there are general elections, the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also earn four (it now has 10) and PSC would lose no more or less than 9 MPs (it has 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - he has three now - while ICV would keep one MP or win one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for the municipal councils, where the people can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and the popular agree that PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get the majority either to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fanciful that this party loses its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they governed with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, they ended up several times.
People have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels and Reus.
At present, PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven inmates in Barcelona, Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerians detained by agents of the General Information Commissariat of the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell which, headed from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaeda groups, between which "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Earth Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the perpetrator of the Bombay attacks which caused the deaths of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" the falsification apparatus of Al Qaeda at the international level has "been debilitated" and therefore "its operational capacity".
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrated the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" could cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only one that the jihadist network held operational in Europe, which is why in the investigations participated, apart from Thai services, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days similar blows to that recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were detained in Thailand, with the capture of the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones who led the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be on behalf of young men between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connect the detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, even though the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that a few days before this attack was committed, Catalonia was sent through a transfer agency a few miles of dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after by the members of the "commando" which killed 106 people.
The police took a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas its conditions to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exhibited during the campaign and which are limited to giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philosophical-sovereignist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to approach half of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise abstain in the vote of nomination.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but for the time being, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are done in Catalan key.
And as far as the PP president is concerned, in order to support an investiture "it would be necessary to eliminate all sovereignist and independenceist discourses", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to lose the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomic administration and the elimination of the tax applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of the Mas nomination negotiations will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not due to "lack of measurements"
Olot centre owners do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
Geriatric officials La Caritat d'Olot (Girona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible in the meantime that he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself with the centre's lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be to be able to bring charges against the person responsible" for the dead but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for failing to detect in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a large compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day on he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of geriatrics - care he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures can never have been the cause of what happened at any time".
Counsel for La Caritat added that "in this case there is only a hint of recklessness on the part of anyone other than the accused."
The person already named "The Angel of Death" confessed the day before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused her death by injecting a sober dose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pellets.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control the access of the centre's staff to medicines.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the interns, used to kill them.
But the laboratory analyses will clarify if Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the interval 12-17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the nurse at night, nor the number of assassinations admitted, they do not eliminate the possibility of a larger number and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way to kill after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday which warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
Peripheral differentials have closed to force and the actions of European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes, and the euro has barely recorded an increment, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market which in the same way as it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by fences of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose fear.
A month ago, ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those remaining.
Bundesbank demanded the completion of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures over time and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, it is hoped that the current liquidity measures "at least until March" will be extended and that the quarterly open-ended auction will continue at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not fulfill the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, may God help us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they said that they had not even considered purchasing bonds and they collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the guys in Portugal dropped 30 basis points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland the figures for the hole in Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potentials and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not having detected the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are amenable in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in an area of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the Autonomous Communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to reactivate employment sound like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange has undergone the 4.5%, the double that the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was swift and radical and we had the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, therefore we hope that it will resolve itself with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to request an Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million available liquidity, the triple compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to the sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "apart from being, to appear."
Courage, we can make it!
Eulen's president will challenge Vega Sicilia's council requested by his sons
The storm does not cease in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he considers it "no law", the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management organs of the firm holding Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José give their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of one part of the group.
The founder of the larger holding company business services does not appear to be willing to yield in his dispute to be present in El Enebro's management bodies.
From his board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors at the meeting of shareholders on January 18 this year whose challenge is registered in the Register of Commerce and Companies.
El Enebro's Judicial Council for the next 16, convened by Madrid's Commercial Magistrate No.2, opened the thunderbox again within the Álvarez family.
The use of the judge to determine the meeting is, until the dispute is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the meeting.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as a "desperate recourse of the plaintiffs his five sons to try, through a procedural arguty, clearly defying the Law and abusing the right, to validate and correct the assembly radically void on January 18", according to his official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for contesting, once the meeting is held, on the grounds that it is "unlawful".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully to have the magistrate convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless solicits usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the motion for challenge for which there is not yet a specified date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with Siemens secret weapon
Software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the Formula One world in 2004, his history in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
In a first moment, no one took into account the options of a new stable that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, the past November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without diminishing the champion's ability as a driver, the German Sebastien Vette, nor the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the Formula 1 world we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives far removed from the high motoristic competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly lines from manufacturing plants all over the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, accurately simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens's industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 plant has allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements detected during the races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season.
In Red Bull's team, 180 young high-skilled professionals are now working, equipped with powerful computer equipment, to analyze and plan any kind of changes to the cars.
Siemens leader explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's cars except the engine, which is Renault's exclusive responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can move from virtual reality from simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced high-tech laser and autoclave production systems.
As a single limitation of this craziness of technological development there is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that's going on over there is considered "top secret."
The staff for this assignment includes 580 people, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula One hero, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the immense technological resources that the energy beverage brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and the reputation null.
The plant's technology manager, Steve Nevey, says five years ago it could be said that the progress of R+D in the case of racing cars brought 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and the technology represents 85% of the success, while the drivers bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 clean stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first in the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Vice-President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the renovated shop located on the Gran Vía of Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group prepared a plan to set up 200 brand outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes all 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openings were in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of the exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of institutional staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive network of shops claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, assisting, post-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-class pioneering pilot program that solves the possible problems of HP IT equipment in warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as the large companies have already contracted technical support services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'flying' a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell's managing director, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse of the interest margins, which will be tried to partially offset with increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell is waiting to capture in three years a million private customers, his task to accomplish.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011 that will run for three years.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to resort to FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market share by capturing a million new private customers - 700,000 if one deducts those who can leave the bank - its great task to accomplish, because so far this bank had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the private customer.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share to individuals is 3.5%, while to the companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disturbed all plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its Optima master plan, established four years ago, even if initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for one more year.
Customers who let the savings banks escape will be its main objective.
During a breakfast organised by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the liability war - which penalises margins - is reducing, the price of risk premiums that banks and caisses pay for its issues to obtain liquidity are already moving at the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We didn't tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November-.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "we will ask for larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he said.
He claims that capital needs "increase greatly" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that FROB can replace the market in the capture of funds in the case of new recapitalizations.
After having assured that Sabadell can survive the temporal closure of the markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks are already predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
He pointed out that one could not issue, but on the contrary of what had happened in June, one could obtain short-term funding through rest, which alleviated the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among credit unions
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again stressed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the merger of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities which ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been carried out, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, they are adjustments."
"Most have been completed completely; it is possible that instead of 17 we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation too," the leader stressed.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process is carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out within the deadlines that have been set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphatized.
"The move from 45 cases with an average volume of 28,500 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a trial without equal in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of rather unhappy opinions about the slowness of the process" which show "a lack of serosity and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain is saying is that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world and attributed to the people who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "goes at the greatest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector did well in the stress tests that ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has opted to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole of the Union.
Market tensions have led to a doble government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of assistance to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel regarding her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, this is another restriction on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which shockes with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, in Germany one begins to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the currency zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, although now it seems from science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, almost a 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for a long time, so now there is no room for an apology.
First, in 2009, when both IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (fiscal rigour plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second coup of the central European country was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From then on it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and publication were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel once again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although a little watered down, was approved and, in the following months, we should attend the process of reform of the Union which makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think to cross.
And it tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not be too much in agreement, from that date the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves in default of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany tells us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a question of extending the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're asked to do is a lot harder.
And what he must absolutely not do in these circumstances is deceive us ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will lead to a greater peace of mind.
And we know how to seize the opportunity we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard it of this form and his double declaration (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of the new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticisms, the path has been opened to the thesis that it is necessary to put order at home.
But the red line Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that we are considering, we cannot exclude the possibility of abandoning a currency area too full of unserious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the will to escape punishment.
The expulsion in principle by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League made a lot of ink on the anti-sportive character of such behavior and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before they finished the game (which their team was already clearly winning), both players deliberately wasted time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, the two players will complete the regulatory sanction during the next match of the barrage game against Auxerre and will be able to pass without boxes in the next phase.
Finally, UEFA's Disciplinary Committee sanctioned with two games the team's coach, José Mourinho and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, if not rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that appeared in the case was due to the fact that this involved a team from Real Madrid's entity (who in his anthem displays nobility and honour and who on past occasions sentenced his players to a fine for similar acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his dilated history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the regulation, contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether such actions commit fraud by law; for, in fact, they are actions respectful of the sports regulation, but seem to evade its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put in danger, i.e. there has been no violent play.
Another of these assets that are alluded to with the correct game is to prevent the player's team from profiting in an unfair way from the opposite team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not accommodate what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the arbitrator.
They were waiting and willingly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders obtain from the intentional faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put the rival in a position of disadvantage and one does not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action presupposes the fact of leaving their own team with fewer players.
And that's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Of course the advantage is that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without boxes that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, as the team could be eliminated all of a sudden and apart from that, with this action the players complete a penalty match and move on to the second round of cartons, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with one less than in the first round.
So, climbing the ladders, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which still forms part of the strategic decision-making that favours the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (it would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law),m otherwise they chose rather the moment in which they submitted themselves to it.
They made a strategic decision without playing the penalty or running away from it.
Even though the boundary between genius and the fraud of the law is diffuse, on this occasion I think we had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, appears because of two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the way in which the director was transmitted to provoke them.
The evil caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of bookings for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the touron and the lottery, when December arrives also come the group dinners before Christmas which continue to be the oxygen balloon for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have led to an offensive t prices adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, coincide businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
To complete the accounting process, this year's calendar (as the night of St. Sylvestre falls on Friday) concentrated requests in the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 17th and 17th) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying from their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all demand battle prices, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer's representative, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before they book."
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prizes," he says.
The deal will go well "for those who give quality at good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers have the tendency to go down a step with the crisis, so that the tranche around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey of various institutions in the centre, there was a collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras Group indicates that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the economic situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another most powerful group, Andilana, with 16 properties in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar assumed more advance bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We did the impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, remains optimistic after having detected an increase in billing since the second semester and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, like Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies invite their employees again and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
On the part of the patronate Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, entrusts in the possibility of starting to see the final of the tunnel and maintains that overall the reservations are "animated", even if the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
This is true, the hope for the festivities has not declined, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear programme gives rise to great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks filtrations confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State filtered through the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that Pakistan's nuclear programme is causing in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details of the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear programme — the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored in components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack — is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
For example, Ambassador Anne W. Patterson of Pakistan listed in a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise is running and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep the guard.
"Pakistan had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered through Julian Assange's portal is the ever smaller cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high degree of Pakistan's production of nuclear weapons.
A dispatch from the Embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frozen", argues: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, D.C., during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the leader that "the Pakistan Army must end with tacit support for terrorist groups".
Hunting the Wikileaks Chief
Obama will number a high official for the fight against terrorism to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have a certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, this one is not new, otherwise it dates from 20 November.
And this one has nothing to do with the last filtration of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents from the United States but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks's creative lawyer, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange".
On the 20th the international police force with headquarters in Lyon (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after having received permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have been advised to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot issue an arrest order for an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organisation's explanations, consider the red notice appeal to be a free way to arrest -- which the national police force must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be present.
The movement outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday issued a letter condemning the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, 39 years old, showed willingness to answer questions from the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for and obtained a permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief of security of Stalin.
"It seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," denounces the missive.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother is defending his son's innocence - Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday he gave an interview from an undetermined place to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he asked the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to the American graduates they are watching at the UN by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should be interested in a guy with a web page," he said for CNN.
Obama himself has instructed Rusell Travers, a senior anti-terrorist official, to prevent further document leaks.
President Barack Obama's spokesman's attempt to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who from January will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House, asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance".
Even further went Tom Flanagan, a advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to go back on his statements after saying that Assange should be "murdered".
"Obama should turn it into an objective and use an unmanned plane or something like that."
One person who did not ask for an apology was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"He who is in the government who has filtered the information is guilty of treason and all that is not a execution would be too kind a punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a wink to the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe for solving the umpteenth internal revolt inside ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that this absolutely cannot give him headaches that he had with other extinct currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballot papers, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to pass a certain penalty vote on the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the chief of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he said that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a "Bulgarian" result would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand a little more from the president than to put his position at the disposal of militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximal organ between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document which the management will submit to the National Council vote on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the Congress for the autumn of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a sure fact.
The ERC leader has admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that its goal is to ensure that once and for all the organization is able to wash its laundry room with the family.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog results symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, two of which he points out.
The first, "recomposing" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, i.e., to include new figures that come from the adept sector of Carod.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that once and for all ERC liquid assembly as operating mechanism.
Thus, it defends a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of the congresses through delegates elected by vote.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already struggled in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsed the management to revise the model of assembly in a specific congress of reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical areas on the lookout, the time could be good to take it back and close it forever.
23 implemented in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Between the murders these of three women are mentioned and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
During the penultimate month of the year there were 390 deaths in theory related to organized crime.
Between the cases one mentions that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the blow of grace to the head, apart from the feet and hands tied with a cable.
The following day, the corpse of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the port-bagging of a vehicle abandoned in the rue Mixtecas in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, of the municipality Naucalpan.
Very early in the morning on Thursday, the four, the owners of jointly exploited lands found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the thorax, on the autopiste near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipal Villa Guerrero.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day later in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots when he was leaving his house to initiate garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a gunshot to the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc settlement, the municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the forehead, a man's body was found on a lonely path to Colonia El Naranjo and under the body a bullet was found struck with a 25-calibre firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies carried out a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
The residents of Tepotzotlán warned about the discovery of a corpse in Peña Colorada, with their hands tied behind and their eyes blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound in his neck.
Half of the month it was reported the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the department Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality Atizapán of Zaragoza, two death warning messages were discovered at the same time with the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the hamlet Zoquiapan of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the corpse of a man in Huixquilucan was located which had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, in agreement with a message that his executors had left behind him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck, a woman's lifeless body was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin we detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with her image.
Towards the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the edge of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet strikes and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of two men with their heads rubbed and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what happens with those who do not align".
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Centre of the San Agustín settlement.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next door; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Close to him, the agents found a bristol with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The country's representative at COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it was maintaining its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 percent by 2020.
China continues to offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 per cent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and to re-establish its industry.
Indeed, he said, over the past four years his country had inverted $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he had made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but it would continue to work together with the international community in that area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including the approval last year of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the targets for greenhouse gas reduction, he explained.
On the other hand, he noted that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local governments to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reductions.
In addition, he said, there are various ongoing or completed multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned that the Energy Efficiency Program, which had been implemented over the past five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent lamps by energy-saving lamps, and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific advisor to the government of that country on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than we think.
For example, he explained, the per capita greenhouse gas emission in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to the contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase a 20% energy efficiency in the last five years and plans to make another similar one by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN has detailed that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is de jure.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is de jure.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order of Sonora Commission."
"Mr Espino has the right to address himself, if necessary, by making a complaint to the Commission of the Order of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he has made it clear that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections of the next 4 and 5 December when a successor would be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and has achieved its objective," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary "we enjoy it and make us stronger", he said.
He said that the council will no doubt be able to elect the best leader that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the succession "to the person determined by the council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the office of president of the party to any of the five."
He anticipated that the party's revival in the previous elections on 4 July would be reflected on the next fight, even if "it's not yet time to think about 2012."
"For the moment it is a question of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have made "a lot of hope for them, and I am sure Gabino will live up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the priists to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they are beginning to defend them; that they are getting out of the closet," he said.
He said that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Audience, because in the country there is no gag, and even less censorship.
Obama promotes law on Twitter for undocumented students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call you senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitted the American president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his Twitter social network personal account.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call you senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté Obama said.
His short message maintains a cybernetic link with a broader document that asks the public to immediately contact senators, as voting on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we hope for soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was leaked after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the extension of Bush's tax cuts and government funding continued.
Such a blockage, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said that he is confident that once the tax problem is solved, one can set an agenda for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get a deal at some point in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The Leader of the Democratic Majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "closing vote on the debate" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they have remained in this country for the last five years and they have been accepted by a higher education institution or the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the support of a large number of Republicans, at times when the project's partisan organizations are intensely lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Between the most courted Republicans there are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of office of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his posture so far.
Even though the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the larger obstacles of the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature we put the finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of the Language was a walk in which participants displayed the narrative
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what is it hoped of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of his question (at another fair the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound "... puts us in an embarrassment", the Argentinian writer gently launched to the public, most of the young, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined afterwards as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "pleasure" is, it goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only leads in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who took his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "On the wound I could only know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very connected with each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a lovely narrative which he called "Eloge to the invention", where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous bewitching woman who touched clouds, brought back people who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a damsel had lost, a narration that was then fired to speak America, the great news that had had from the beginning her own columnists and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the narrations of the conquering capitans.
"Cervants who invented all of us (the writers) made fun of the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that lacked even modesty."
Nevertheless, he stressed, "crazy and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with lies, we no longer know what part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is called the 'Tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is thanks to his heritage that we are what we are telling."
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations brought about by the invitation of the FIL with its round table Le owes on the wound.
The Cuban-Portuguese has put his own on the great wound of the social violence that his country is going through - and Latin America is sharing - produces disputes about trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think good literature, good poetry good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening is over with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "it must on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciousness that turns to the advantage of dogmatism, "behind every affirmation there is a little no and behind every denial there is a little yes".
"To be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we have to nuance: and nuance means many times laying the finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very convenient thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance and disturbing also the powers who prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting to regain the sense of writing.
Romano hunting his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the Santos Laguna and Monterrey duel in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals, he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series, even if so far he has not put in the mile and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinian finally consoled himself with the sub-champion medal, he stayed one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santist strategist came to his first final as a coach in the Opening Tournament 2002, when he held the reins of Morelia with whom he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later in the Closing 2003 he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and that was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again, as his team made an equal game of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed by 11 meters and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournament, so he doesn't want to have the same fate, he tries to break away from the malefice so he can celebrate for the first time a title, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented the helmsman when asked what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, which he assures that he learned a lot, "the only lesson we can remember is that until the referee whistles the final, we can't celebrate, we're prepared in the line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run and I think that's a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which doesn't worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never try to arrive at the series of penalties, we try to finish within the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare ourselves, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anxiety to hold the title in our hands, it has escaped us, it has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we no longer arrive in this situation".
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining visas
Individuals must go to the Service Centres for Visa Applicants prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to report to the Visa Applicants Service Centres (CSA) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have some advantages for aspirants, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to obtain an appointment, another payment for processing the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (this includes visas for temporary workers) and $390 for business and investor visas.
Persons wishing to renew their visas will not be required to attend an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only report to the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken in the CSA, applicants who wish to have a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA to Announce the Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The United States Space Agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Administration of Aerospace and Aeronautics (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday, at 13:00 hours at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When it quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present who will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", which prompted speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that we thought were uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if its living conditions are improved.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought to be too venomous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our volunteer atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, this proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will communicate the true reach of discoveries in tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
The conference will be attended by the geobiology Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest satellite in Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón 'bloc' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of bipartism is possible, we denounce.
The 60th had just settled in the Congress when an opposing bloc, led by PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, appeared in the Congress, which declared itself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of the 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tonned' against the reform of the Organic Law, for it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we initiate 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four deputies, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Executive Board chaired by the PANIST Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute political marginality on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme based on political will and if they do not have it, they will again be enslaved by both parties and in this way will end the opposing coalition.
"So far (the opposing coalition) has happened, that is what I am looking at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress, after having been monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is an eternal bipartism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergence abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that now the Congress has turned into a 'butt' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the MP's personality, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave by cupular agreements outside of 5 which will probably be 9 Members, now that the five we are seen are separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to look for a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform that they have made, that they have decided, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
Mazatlán Town Hall pays another check to the owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque of about 200 miles pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Town Hall.
With this, the amount paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company is 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipe, the last cheque number 9258447 was issued on the past 16 November for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in concept of "liquidation of supplier accounts".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued to Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, two on 15 October, on 19 October, on 29 October and on 16 November.
Even though the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after the 25 July Noroeste had published a revision of the cheques that the Town Hall issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the meantime March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipe paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be treated
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourist sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Traders' Association of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly asked for the image of the destination to be cared for and new activities must replace the others that tourists find bad.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and sidewalks affected because tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid the nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to shut down a business one day and they don't know the fortune you lose, elsewhere they didn't do the work for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Mangart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the Town Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and avoid that it passes again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and only do the fix," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must we maintain it, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the Town Hall must change its strategy to maintain the city well".
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it only depends on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the attention they need and this type of fact points to something that is well known to all, the interview is necessary".
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlán is urgent, because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put in line together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a touristic vocation.
"Happily Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that we should order first, clean and put us online to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination".
IP requests results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations that confront each other.
The business sector of Mazatlán asks for a work legislator worthy and free of agreements between the parties and the government executive, because Sinaloa is convulsed and confronts major problems.
Yesterday the 60th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 deputies of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives was installed.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress is a management own and engaged with the society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat themselves.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations that confront each other.
"We hope that MPs will really exercise their right, free of agreements between parties because the custom is that they make pacts to safeguard their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask that they certify the commitment to build the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making progress.
"We will ensure that they do dignified and above all engaged work with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa have given them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Mangart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in seeking the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and this in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and which rivals directly with agro-industry".
Apart from the need to classify resources for detonating tourism projects that help to ensure the state is safe and to update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for king wise
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, for their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a kid.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear the toys and clothing they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day by day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell tangerines and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plèbes' for sale on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, José Alfredo, 10 years old, long aspires to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jesús, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothes of size for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I wish I had this monster', but I told him 'we will see, my son', because he was very dear', remembers Cayetana with sadness.
For older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, wears size 12; Isaías, 10 years old, wears size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, wears size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make reality the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the On Searche Roi Mage campaign, giving a toy or money to the reception of Noroeste.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches were carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in locations allegedly used for drug production.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, silver and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for the Sûreté du Québec.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two Sherbrooke men.
Those arrested were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches were carried out following a long-term investigation, which lasted for almost a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec regional investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Régie de police Memphrémagog took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without any problems
The Conservatives' bill, which, according to the government, should solve the problem of boats loaded with illegal migrants, will obviously be defeated when the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I am standing with a party that created granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, when he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow for the detention of any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants for up to one year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The Bloc Québécois leader, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he was targeting the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we'll see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
The NDP's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has sideways rejected criticism that her party is not firm enough about illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree that action should be taken against smugglers and that is what we are doing through another bill, the C-35," Chow said.
"We do not support the Conservatives' bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are massively telling MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," Minister Kenney responded.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections should it be rejected.
However, a Conservative told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that each member who opposes would explain himself or herself to his or her constituents.
The new unity is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, maintains that this idea is not a long way back: Quebec City would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York on this matter as early as last January.
The metropolis has had a permanent unity on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services in Quebec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It did not take any more for the Péquiste critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe this announcement as "rabbit out of a hat" and as "do-it-yourself solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You will see the result when we announce it, does he just assert."
"We're aware of this problem."
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, there is no substitute for a public inquiry.
"The more Mr Charest persists in not wanting to set up this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the École nationale d'administration publique.
To break this impasse, he suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We need to be able to expand the Auditor General's mandate," he said.
He also felt that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government boxes.
Quebec City would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better respond to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews confirmed that his colleague in the Department of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently working on certain amendments related to this issue.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit motorcycle groups, although the Criminal Code was not adequate, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several rivers remain under high monitoring due to heavy precipitation that has occurred in several parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated on a preventive basis.
In the evening, another slip would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road broke down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rain fell on several areas, 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimetres of rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the region.
Areas north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
As this precipitation must be added to the snowmelt already accumulated in some areas, there is concern that several streams may overflow.
Flood alerts were issued on Wednesday evening by the Sécurité civile du Québec for the Ouareau and l'Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers at Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and the oak in Lotbinière, were subject to flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière area, heavy rainfall has led to the overflowing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In the Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes has resulted in the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on alert and closely monitors the situation," said Annik Bouchard, Security Advisor.
On Wednesday, the Centre de prévision des crues du Québec issued warnings of strong floods for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, l'Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Partially Blamed Dupont
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) for controversial remarks on social assistance and Haitians as well as on her coarse language on the air.
The CBSC found that Mr.Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some remarks contained "incorrect information about social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and coarse language that is not suitable for broadcasts during the day."
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the broadcast of the names of two individuals who committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were inaccurate.
Facilitators must present solid information rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, host Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide to be a coward's gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes of "Dupont le midi" have addressed a sensitive issue in a fair and appropriate manner."
Therefore, no blame has been placed on him.
The last dispute concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then engaged in a media face-to-face that had elicited a lot of reactions.
The host of CHOI said that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because it could not be known with certainty that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already purged my three-day suspension on that."
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," said the host.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which must, among other things, announce these decisions once during prime time within three days.
King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs on the tatami and ring of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," said Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights all over the place, because for those who don't like playing on the ground in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, he who works as a security guard and as a clerk for UPS has just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"Currently, I'm getting ready to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
"The fighters who finished among the top four at the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've made progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I will be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punches and kicks, as well as projections on the ground, are allowed.
Duels take place initially on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous pugilist from this form of combat is the Vietnamese-born American Cung Le, well-known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explained the friendly fellow."
"It's a bit like the Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It's been a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semifinal of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real pro," he analyzed.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other in order to crown one champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without invitations to tender
Hydro-Québec has awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium made up of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor firms obtained the largest amount, that of project management, for a sum of $295 million without a call for tenders.
This consortium called Energy Stewardship was formed in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with the responsibility of managing this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Stewardship Consortium issued the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing price increases.
"It's the new way of collusion and cutting down on competition."
"In other words, people, instead of doing this in a secret way, now do it in an open way," said PQ MP Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
Earlier this morning, Mr. Simard raised the matter in the National Assembly because he said he had difficulty seeing how the public interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there had been collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she pestered, arguing that the PQ had been "unethical" and had "lacked rigor."
She said that "it would be the least of things" that the PQ apologized.
The consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond to a call for bids for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The project is in progress and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition acting; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the consortium formula in the consulting engineering sector is under investigation by the government.
A quick overview of Quebec's business register makes it possible to count more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Dessau works in partnership with most of its major competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and the same legal person, Dessau.
With respect to the Energy Stewardship Consortium, Minister Normandeau noted that "the territory of James Bay has been responding to particular workforce dynamics and Hydro-Québec has been responding to them in a particular way since the 1970s."
The major owner of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation that made the project's management contract frown.
"If you go to tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that's important, it's the competence of people," Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Energy Stewardship Consortium is part of a long list of contracts over $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention his participation in Energy Stewardship.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 contract with Energy Stewardship.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau dropped the fact that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "finance it", before stating that they were rather its leaders.
Responsible Consumption Barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
Quebec consumers have very little confidence in the players involved in sustainable development, but also in fair brands and greening certifications to guide their choices.
Worse, even if it bathes in a media world where messages in favour of more responsible consumption are growing, it deplores a lack of credible information, which it even describes as a brake on its commitment, indicates the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatoire de la consommation responsable de l'Université Sherbrooke.
Another observation: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands showing themselves to be eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, politicians' discourse on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this segment of consumption currently driven by nearly a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information would calm the ardours of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
On the other hand, one third of Quebecers also say they are suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services that are being put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and, above all, to have changed the brand of one or more products to meet their conviction.
At 61%, they have also favoured purchases from traders in their neighbourhood and favoured the purchase of food products grown in their area, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - the Homo consumerus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological consciousness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, just 28% of Quebecers said they used public transit or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this vast behavioural survey, which has just taken its first shot.
A State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris by the Société Angus and the Parallelle, agrees to collaborate, but up to one loan only.
The Société de développement Angus et le Parallèle, hoping for a $7 million donation from the Ministère de la Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinema complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard by giving him back his full cinephilic vocation, did not get what they were demanding.
The government agrees to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would be less than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of sources from state agencies.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who is leading the eXcentris project.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the cabinet's counter-proposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until 31 December to respond.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the gift of the State really has to be ruled out.
Recall that the Association des propriétaires de cinémas et de cinéparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it has not done for other cinemas.
On the contrary, however, a number of stakeholders in the community called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of caeans, for ten years carried the author's cinema to his premises of the complex after having financed his own construction, which could justify a derogation on the part of the Treasury Board.
The lack of theatres for independent films is starring in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
The Angus Society and the Parallel, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private fundraising campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the acquisition wheel.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, has continued to broadcast films in eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three theatres on February 27 by screening Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des dieux's beautiful film.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals made to them.
The veil raised on a complex Canada...
The new US diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks shed light on what the United States considers to be the Canadian inferiority complex to the Americans, but at the same time betray the US's sense of superiority over Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have the Canada-U.S. relationship in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government pass its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out in the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the midst of a federal election campaign, recounts the extent to which the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the U.S. ambassador in Ottawa.
Mr. Wilkins provided some explanations for this situation.
"A nearly inherent Canadian inferiority complex may make it necessary for Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues in everyday life rather than to focus this election on the United States (as in the free trade campaign of 1988)," he wrote.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it".
The Ambassador understands this deafening "silence" all the less because the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote."
The other expression of this sense of importance is the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival in the confidence vote on the federal budget in early February, by which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade because of a $30-$40 billion stimulus plan," Breese says.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that CBC drama shows are sending back from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O programs, in which little subtle references are made to Maher Arar, to the "No-Fly-List" or to abductions for the CIA's muscular interrogations.
Another cable tells us that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he handed over a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, let's note that the spirits are warming up about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered".
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
The United Nations proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs), which corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in line with the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to have adopted in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode bulbs (LED or "LED" in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of emissions from the global car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase aggregate GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract from this balance still 5 Gt in order to achieve stabilization by 2020 the rise of the climate to 2 degrees centigrade in order to avoid it becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates as heat and the rest, 5%, produces light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by twice again.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, like those launched by Philips manufacturer this week - this company participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent light bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These all new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have shown reservations about compact fluorescent light bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place guidelines.
But, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants, which would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire looks forward to the announcement of the electoral results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the expiry of the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," said a spokesman for the UN leader.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission missed the deadline of Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after the election on Sunday.
About 40 minutes before the deadline expired, the President of the CIS stated on television that the Commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied Wednesday in the world so that the CIS finally proclaims the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But Camp Gbagbo is counting on the Constitutional Council's cancellation of "faudulent" votes in the north, held by the former Forces nouvelles rebellion (FN) since the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian president, said that the intimidation of voters by the FN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's complaints were upheld by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northerner who denies any connection with the ex-rebels, found the delay in announcing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that bringing a complaint to the Constitutional Council, after having prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, on Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that had remained split in two for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the lead of the first round on 31 October, with 38% of the vote against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, which received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas departments), show the seasonally adjusted provisional data (CVS) published on Thursday by INSEE.
The number of unemployed in metropolitan France is 2,631 million.
Data for the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the working population in metropolitan France and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate has risen by 0.1 percentage points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people on the labour market has deteriorated further, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, rising to 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 point over three months, +0.5 point over one year) and 25% including the overseas departments.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15-24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
Seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points over three months as well as over one year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the French overseas departments.
Only 25-49 year-olds benefited from stable unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
INSEE no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy about its calculation method.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, head of waste treatment companies and brother of the President PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was indicted and imprisoned at the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with abuse of social property, misappropriation of funds and public property, concealment, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, says his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies."
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible counts, it is something else to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before the hearing of his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strongman of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, had, through his lawyers, to pass to the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged on Wednesday night and imprisoned.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than operate the dumps he had to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds linked to their operation, he was never aware of them, said Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was charged on Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial supervision with prohibition to meet the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain the facts of the charges against him."
"The examining magistrate took this into account by not denying him freedom," said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been charged and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them being placed under judicial supervision, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "traffic of influence and passive corruption".
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Briguier, are under investigation for "subtraction and misappropriation of public goods by a person entrusted with a public service mission", the other for "complicity in misappropriation of public funds".
Finally Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was charged for "recel of abuse of social goods".
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies were used to launder money from big banditry.
The investigation is carried out in the framework of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for alleged frauds in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
From a source close to the survey, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the waste from Aubagne as well as from certain cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysée exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", held the public in suspense in France, alerted diplomacy, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the depths of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, even giving them advice on the treatment of their own "hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not been matched by the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the US court for trafficking in materials for the benefit of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they place under a harsh light the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it was nothing of the sort.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French Comments on Managing Hostage Cases".
The Elysée Advisor for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, meet with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "put the words "fundamental human rights", "innocentness", "immediate release" in the media.
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more because the Iranians are asking you not to do it."
Because, past attempts to discuss through discreet channels, "silence will settle nothing", the Iranians are "masters in delaying maneuvers".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day she takes refuge at the French embassy) "will require the payment of a large amount of money to Iranians" (230,000 euros in bail).
And he says that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will worsen".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but remains stuck in Iran.
Information is being disseminated: Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The American Embassy, like many observers, wonders about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iran's clandestine nuclear procurement networks, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted a bargain?
The release of the Iranian against the release of the French?
In a further interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he said, was not only "completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There were lively exchanges between the French presidency and the keeper of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot go back on the decision," he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of French intelligence services.
The Elysée Councillor dials a telephone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée is making every effort, through press releases and "leaks" organized in the media, to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influent" role as a "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity, not without irony, and note that manipulation is bearing fruit since several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
On what basis is so much "gratitude" expressed towards Mr.Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their praising statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what Syrians have actually done."
The document then looks at the reasons that led the Elysée to pour in this fiction.
The intense communication effort "to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which "had been perceived by many critical voices in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "show Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows it from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in supporting the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called "Cinderella" law that will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, said government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under the age of 16 years, said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the minister responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents so request, added the manager.
It will also make available to people who demand it free software to limit the amount of time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
Global 2018-2022: Fifa designates the organizing countries
In turmoil due to suspicions of corruption, the Executive Committee of the Fifa on Thursday designates the countries organizing the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where the struggles of influence and lobbying risk taking precedence over the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the fifa queen competition will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its establishment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities from the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political stakes of a World.
Behind-the-scenes deals may therefore last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the Fifa evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the origin of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football which hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC released a documentary featuring three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to displease the Fifa and embarrass the English officials, who have engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of government hopes to re-edit the hit by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity suffice to restore the coat of arms of England to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spain-Portugal duo is not lacking in assets with its already ready stadiums, its expertise (Global-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings of its file (stades, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and denounced a "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against members of the EC.
"We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, based on the experience of 1994, appears to be the logical favourites.
As the world's leading economic power, home to Fifa's main sponsors, the country seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have separately built a very beautiful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organised the event in 2002.
Another threat is the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, which is eagerly desired by the Fifa, which would in fact render the Asian chances for 2022 obsolete.
With Qatar, which has released the big game by proposing futuristic stadiums, and Australia, the Fifa would continue its expansion to new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, may also suffer from the low TV fees paid (due to jet lag) by European countries, the nerve of the Fifa war.
Second mandate: the obvious
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made it look like he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation whatsoever.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they did.
One warrant at the Elysée calls for another.
So the current Head of State will be running in 2012.
But the evidence does not fit well with the mystery part attached to the presidential function.
Then we have to pretend that doubt still exists.
In one way or the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy, with a serious look, assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011".
That he mentions in front of MPs UMP, Tuesday night at the Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" has therefore sown a bit of febility.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were a long way off.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional review limited the number of quinquennats to two.
He was making a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that he evokes the presidential, in the tone of humour, during such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he had launched in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His words the day before yesterday do not make him more candidate than the day before; they do not make him less.
There are two reasons why they give rise to comments.
The acceleration of the race for the PS application, on the one hand.
But it is not the entry into the contest of Ségolène Royal that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious, many of the PS are calling for an earlier-than-expected order of battle.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time the right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this," immediately and cautiously reacted the Prime Minister's entourage.
"If he thinks defeat is possible, he won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, clearly resigned.
Euro: ECB forced to keep its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to provide an opportunity to clarify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of many of the non-conventional monetary policy operations that are due to be completed at the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis is forcing, and the Frankfurt issuing institution will probably not be able to afford to be as peremptory as it is, or to worsen a situation that is more than tense today in European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, welcomed the active role played by the ECB in supporting the resolution of the state debt crisis in Europe.
It did not wish to say whether it believed that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my reflection to my European partners (...) ".
The day before, in Brussels, at its hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more disarrangement as to his intentions, merely stating that the programme for the purchase of government securities on the secondary market was "continuing" and that "we will see what we will decide" at this Thursday's meeting.
Only certain: the ECB will keep its main policy rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled to nearly €1.35 billion last week.
And, according to market operators' indiscretions, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have purchased 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about expectations of continued purchases (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect a significant change of course.
While lending operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on generous terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this arrangement to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that she's significantly changing her program."
Michael Schubert, Commerzbank's economist, says: "If not, it would risk creating new tensions in the short term.
"A gradual release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal, predicts.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its intervention in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these bonds in order to animate an atone market", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European bank exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a rush of yields paid by the most fragile states," a major bond manager said yesterday.
For if interest rates soar, the states will be all the more constrained to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
Safeguarding the euro is at that price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government makes the round back
After a worrying start of the week for Italy, yesterday the situation eased slightly with the fall in ten-year bond rates.
A return to precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "undecipherable" and expect a "unforeseeable" weekend, which he later denied.
On Tuesday in any case, the gap with the German long rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of hedging contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had soared to 263 points, leading to a certain panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand, Gianni Letta, said he was "strongly concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the lack of fiscal revenue that goes with it, putting the State at risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget currently under review in the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the public deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," says Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of his economy are in order and his accounts are good, we repeat it for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short term or in the long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilisation efforts demanded of Italy are less than those demanded of other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD Chief Economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would open up a period that is not conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde once again hammered him yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe that it was still demonstrated Sunday in the day and at night, are obviously united, determined, committed to defend their currency and their currency zone."
Although all relative, yesterday's relaxation on the rates of European government bonds brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt rating, the target of today's speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which affects banking systems in particular," said Exane BNP Paribas economists.
All the more so because "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it presents, European countries are stepping up discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis measures.
Informal consultations among the most directly involved finance ministers and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are well underway.
This is also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started on Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform investors in the Far East about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, he certainly prepares the ground for them.
The first issues of EFSF securities are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an American official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries that are at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, for their part, are in the process of adopting structural reforms, particularly as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms in addition to austerity measures with closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path than Greece and Ireland.
Both sides would like at all costs to avoid asking for international aid before putting in place their own budgetary adjustments and deciding on the structural reforms necessary to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of normalising sovereign bond markets.
While in Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand over to the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, consider that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, with a budget of EUR 60 billion to date.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
The snowy episodes still cause difficulties in traffic, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and risk disrupting certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigilance due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienne, were added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snowy episodes are significant enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, Météo France warns.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments have been banned from heavy goods vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking his vehicle only if necessary and the traffic of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the circulation of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked the airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights on the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly due to the coming snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in the Ile-de-France has been in full swing, billions are raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, the Grand Paris metro, to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, is worth 23 billion.
To start this GSP, the state announced a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the GSP to borrow a share of the financing of its double loop on the markets.
Today, we finally come to the first additions.
The 2010 amending Finance Act, which was discussed in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in the Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated as follows: "The revenue from this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a reorganisation of an office tax which already exists "in order to modernize it, increase its product and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it cost?
Mystery.
It's not encrypted in the text.
We're far from the 4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the capital allocation that will be mobilised by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project proceeds", can be read in the explanatory memorandum.
At the GSP, we do not find this system shocking.
"From the moment we create revenue (both taxes, ed.), we can cover the studies over three years and then type in the 4 billion after, we explain."
"This will be entered in the budget and drawn as and when."
The GSP estimates that the $4 billion will begin to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised 4 billion are still to the absent subscribers, risks causing a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers avengers and spies on stage
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only appears as scandal because of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and prefigures a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every file made up of a secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those of which Berlusconi is the owner), and Khadafi's sinister caricature profile has long been for cabaret artists to sketch.
The rule that secret records should be composed of only known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookshop dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous books.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (neither knows where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only in what they already know, and reconfirm what they have already learned.
It's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same goes for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of limited mind) the head of the secret services (if not he could be, what do I know, the editor of Libération), who retains as true only what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the week before.
Then why did the disclosures on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of state can call themselves or take a plane to meet at dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small performance exercises, have turned into spy centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only through hypocrisy that we pretend to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to place American diplomacy in the wrong light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
So the scandal does not put the victims in so much crisis as the "bourreaux".
But let's get to the deep nature of what happened.
In Orwell's time, we could conceive of power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had completely turned out since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when we show, as happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is true, too, that all knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret of secret, because it is in the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to remove all power.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but did too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to post any reserved information - that would be like publishing it on a poster stuck at the corner of the street.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is futile to expect to be able to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state flew and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I am well aware that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discreetly in uncontrollable stages, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept as a single copy in locked drawers: in the background, the attempt to spy on the Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now moving in crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wire telegraph (telephones).
The videocassettes (analogs) had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going forward and backwards and discovering all the secrets of editing, while now the CDs (digitals) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the trips it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that communications policy and techniques should come back to horse-drawn cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was going on in the secret of embassies.
Now it is the embassies that ask the press for confidential information.
Climate: How France hacks its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to look at the fulfilment of the fast-start or early-start financing promises made by developed countries.
And the big French tweaks are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries pledged $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (or 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU released the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency exercise is appreciated and appreciated: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
In 2010, the EU announced that it had committed €2.2 billion, putting it on the right track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen Agreement, "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being to the detriment of Official Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference year: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France believes that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' expenditures or to the overall level of Official Development Assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to fulfil its commitment to "new and additional" funding...
Another crucial element is the distribution between grants and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses how to calculate.
Some, such as France, consider that 1€ lent is equivalent to 1€ given.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
While the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to mitigation of emissions that rely on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that is to be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is to be donated... At most, it should only be counted as part of its commitments as the cost of the loan to the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing to do with such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of €420 million by making 91.5% of loans (€389.8 million) and 8.5% of grants (€36.1 million) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1€ to meet its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
That's a nice trick.
To sum up, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it manages to make believe that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it was enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter on early financing is only a small, relatively short-term issue in relation to all climate discussions.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting method for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could move forward the discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently being discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
Hope therefore rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Warning of pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (ex-Movement pour les droits et le respect des générations futurs).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have significant statistical value in relation to the small number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem addressed", bought between July and September the foods generally consumed in four meals and one snack in one day by a ten-year-old child in supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as treats, were examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as certain carcinogens as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individual chemical are not exceeded, it is clear from our survey that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is of concern," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three known as certain carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack by the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, one of which is a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenya green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even breadstick and chewing gum were packed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
For dinner, salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to warm the microwave meal was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of this "contaminant cocktails" is "probably underestimated", according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "in the face of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which were in cereals.
