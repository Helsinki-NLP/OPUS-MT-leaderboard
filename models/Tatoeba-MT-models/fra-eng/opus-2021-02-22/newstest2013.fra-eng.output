A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre regards the latter as a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
Moreover, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the U.S.
It is in this spirit that a majority of US governments enacted new laws from 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon grew after the November 2010 elections, which saw 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require electors to present a photo ID card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
These laws also reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day, and deprive citizens with legal records of their right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana's law in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have universal identity cards such as the health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than 35,000 dollars; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID card.
Much more.
Students, who are considered more likely to vote for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID cards issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators sponsored laws in 2011 abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the voters in the state.
The same was true of Hispanics.
They represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In return, the whites who made up 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of the Democratic governors.
The Attorney General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted legislation requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as a clear objective of influencing the results in 2012 in key states.
A report from the Brennan Centre in 2011 shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to state with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: whether to take the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes present erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
This makes men who are already reluctant to take tests even more reluctantly.
Take the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In studies in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, found a difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that we have between 30 and 40% more chance of having metastases if we are not detected.
So I recommend the test from age 50, or from age 40 if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the possible options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect life in the long term, and by opting instead, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest that they do active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
Increasingly, precise criteria are being determined for deciding who should or should not be treated.
So I still recommend taking the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with his doctor to determine whether or not we should pass it.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the APS test.

Preventing disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting good lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of harm.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many also remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Cigarettes are linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
It's very harmful to people's health.
"Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer falls by half.
Weight
Overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease, according to CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer," it is added.
Food
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
Too much of it increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
Charcuterie too, and they should be avoided.
Storage of meat by smoking, drying or salting may result in the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"These can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," it is explained.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research is, however, inconclusive at the moment.
Studies of vitamin E are contradictory, according to CSC.
While one noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also unclear.
Mr. Beaulieu also stresses the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Having a screening test doesn't give you cancer."
The Higgs husked boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created a great stir last summer, and for good reason.
Indeed, we believe that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that this is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but data is still missing to be absolutely certain.
Let's assume, however, that this is the Higgs, since the chances of making mistakes seem slim, and let's see what this is all about.
There is, in this world, a fatally inescapable law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're gonna hurt yourself.
But even if particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - that "state" consisting roughly of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner there are good citizens named fermions, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
And in the other there are bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not discuss here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosons, we must emphasize here, are not all as exotic bugs as we might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "message" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "worries" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a bit like a rock thrown into a pond.
From this "disruption" arises an electromagnetic wave (from light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "bearers of force".
Stable Field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, except that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to reach very, very high energies, a bit as if it were a frozen pond whose only a very large rock could ride the surface.
This is why it takes a huge particle accelerator like that of CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and mass.
Not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never stand on its own on a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (like photon, you) do not.
Now, what "can bring" all this research, asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to examine any discrepancies between observations and predictions of MS.
In fact, many wish to find them, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oops!).
But we haven't found any such discrepancies at CERN so far.
Implications
The impact of this research on the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs. Tout-le-Monde is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratories had no suspicion of the revolution that their work would trigger.
They were looking at scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already heard from the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 -, initially the laser was rather seen as a "Labo gadget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from the whole instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his optical work.
This sensor, although not at all its original intent, now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras in the world, and earned it the Nobel Prize in Physics 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, you never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die...
With its Commission to Die in Dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is expected to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this crucial area.
The Devoir tried to take a closer look at it.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was eating him had left him with a two-year respite.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said, half-figue half-raisin, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents it from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Attached in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, speaks to strangers who work around him, bring him his medicine, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is for me to be healed of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"During our lifetime, we learn that a man is pissing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Regressing to the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to accept regression," he notes.
Because, in the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor Gadbois Palliative Care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the "team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides "curative" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "conscious and suffocated".
But the illness made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in life," she says, before she accepts a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, however, she is waiting for a last visit from her son from Italy.
Victor Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, provides body care and food assistance.
It is palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when you know you all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr.Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house.
Whether it is physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
If you die, you'll be willing to take care of your mouth with brandy or Pepsi, depending on the request.
Diabetes patients will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served Mr. X a beer, who died overnight.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the deceased's feet.
"We help loved ones as much as patients," says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow each other but do not resemble each other.
Along with an old 93-year-old man who enjoyed his last family gathering in the courtyard, well seated in his pillows while being toasted in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically died, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois house arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Palliative care access problem
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to ease suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his or her life, whether at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And many organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Society of Home Palliative Care in Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec health care that causes several physicians specialized in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by leading palliative care practitioners such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health care system is not strong enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before they agree to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency, in great pain, without being taken care of to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients are only asking to die because they don't receive proper care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are working hard on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she gave up trying chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she told me that she was sorry I stopped fighting, she said.
But she told me I was done!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not having responded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Palliative Care at the Society of Home Palliative Care in Greater Montreal, patients would be resistant to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which amounts to falling asleep until the time of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of the suffering.
More and more, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Sick people who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me", it means "I want to be relieved".
The production of this report was made possible through a Canadian Institutes of Health Research journalism award.
Large-Scale Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know from a formidable "system", mixing construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
A "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers a lot, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has crumbled since the great means were taken," said Jacques Duchesneau, MP for Quebec City and former chief of police for Montreal.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a fundamental investigation into malfeasance related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, had only agreed to step back.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, covert party financing and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the start of the survey in 2010, he points out, the only Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars on contracts," some repressing their instincts to get a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he added, hoping that it will succeed in "demonstrate the stratagems behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also working with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More the police officers of the "Marteau squad" who, since 2009, have allegedly led the "cartel des seweres" of Montreal to put the gentle pedal on the swellings of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and laid charges of fraud and corruption against elected municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of taking bribes repeatedly in exchange for public contracts.
There are also formal charges against Montreal road engineers and Italian-born entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the Commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who donated the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr.Zambito sowed in the 2000s, giving more than C$88,000 (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
He also admitted to having organized an illegal fundraiser for the former Deputy Liberal Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts costing him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked roundly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, gave a detailed report to the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totalling $736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts, the costs of which he inflated.
Other officials of the road have confessed to getting the leg greased by inflating from 30% to 40% the bills, by fake extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget feeding his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected officials to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million to developers, in the middle of a real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, she says that she "draws on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and pin the wrongdoers".
The process, she says, is "sweet but positive".
We're cleaning up the wound, but we'd need a Montréal-specific investigation unit and a watch, so we don't have to see suspicious practices coming back.
Just like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elected in the knowledge of the scheme", when they were not soaked in the scam!
Estimating 70% of the dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he ironically said: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but this will not change the situation, according to him: "As long as election expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He called for a complete revision of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "We cannot go any further; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will make it possible to rebuild the house on a stronger basis, with more controls and laws."
While this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I progress by their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And in the game, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not inflamed.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-formation centre to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced in stages.
So you take advantage of the competition set up by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He was supported by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with hupped clubs.
He's been with some big players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a heartwarming discussion with him.
Then I came out of a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my performance.
What do you look at the first part of the season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as leader.
But we're still ambushed.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the club's objective in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
First we want to finish first of our hen, ahead of Porto, so we can receive on the 8th of the final return.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and register for the long term.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the MTP is building the capacity to make this project happen.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really have a lot to do with this champion title.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a really big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It's normal that we expect a lot of us from what's been invested and from the players we have.
We totally accept it.
After that, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and you still find things to blame for, it's sure it's a little frustrating.
One wonders what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we could answer here.
Look at Manchester City who has not been able to qualify for the 8th final for two seasons, they have also made huge expenses!
With regard to the sums invested, we imagined you with 15 points in advance to the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can have a smile by telling ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Good thing we're saying there's a "Zlatan addiction."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he has many goals.
That's why he came here and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
He showed everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He, too, respects the men he has around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I was keen to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grabbing game time.
I saw things there and I got out reinforced.
Today, I manage to make good matches in selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
Lessons have been learned from what has happened in Ukraine and we have to be exemplary in our behaviour today.
What look do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifier group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the winner.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good draw (1-1) torn off on 16 October in Spain a founding match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never had a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite is true of current currency exchanges based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between stakeholders.
Moreover, as is often the case in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from peer to peer.
Some 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to 2 dollars, five months later, before returning today around 10 dollars (prices are recorded on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or can buy (and sometimes trade in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
Each time, however, a central authority controls and processes trade.
With Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are both depository of the book of accounts, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses in the same way as an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to make sure that the bitcoins exchanged exist in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction into this book.
It involves solving a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner, a sort of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file hash phase, that is, the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hashing" the whole.
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to fraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other left orphaned because the two have different prints.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, leaving a margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also met with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The flaw used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also mentions the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Weighted actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analysed the book and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant balances" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, believes a lot in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but he uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus return cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement among merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
All they need to do is provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that thousands of users are there.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to impose itself, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, plans to re-evaluate the various risks, which are now considered to be high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is above all the Afghan peasants that we have punished by seeing them as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, as in the Soviet era.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, these will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was in order.
The convoys of trucks and armoured personnel returned to Kabul without being attacked, overflew by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban raid on Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood as a result of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants, who have been overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved these days.
Former Mujahedin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmen, seizing government land and selling it to refugees who had returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge American subcontracts.
They were demeaned; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to benefit from the American broads: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They came together with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who will no longer want to go back to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who are going to order it be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, like the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
No industry has been restarted, no dams are in repair, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing except fruit and vegetables is produced.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
There has been widespread noise that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to take it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the province's largest employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, will also need to re-establish normal relations.
The departure of French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: lycée for girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of bringing together aid and offensive actions, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has carried out, and commissioned by a small French NGO, numerous works of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, which is greedy of local labour, has helped to contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and an increase in cultivable areas.
What will we leave to remember, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys often located at more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, which farmers have told me they wish, small, well-controlled civilian aid that directly affects them should be maintained.
A Forceps Constitution in Egypt
It's a new poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, it has decided to play its game.
Taking everyone short, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State granted this House an additional two months to finish its work.
Egypt has been relying almost two years on a provisional text, several times amended which undermines institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the gap in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "traitor his word" and "pietine the law".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to give up their plans to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, this is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy as the protest rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote favorably, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
All the more so since this use of a hasty vote is due to the Egyptian people's ultimatum: "Would you vote for my text, or I will keep the full powers", these are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted yesterday.
Most Liberals were missing.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing that they had not been able to put forward their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society had done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added in haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it was most often unanimously that the articles were voted on.
Commentators also had fun that only one of the differences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the pendulum of the constituent was wrongly settled.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
As a matter of concern, Article 2 remains the same as that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the liberals reply, who see it as just a touch of communication.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
These include article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the first fruits of a theocracy."
The Liberals' fears are further exacerbated by the fact that the next president of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of civil status.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" tempers Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits "that there may be ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used borrow from religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic case law].
And the question might arise in the future as to the extent to which civilian judges are competent to rule on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the former regime.
Another contentious point is the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will trials of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
The latter also expressed their concerns about the text, which they considered to be liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy was maintained and insult was now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, particularly in the press.
In addition, there are no more articles that echo the protection of women, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point was the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was due to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
The head of state's supporters will march on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the center of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the grandeur of Bible truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has identified five main reasons for travelling to Israel.
Go and worship the holy places
A must-see: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these "baptismal depths" will be touched by divine grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he appeased the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
It was at this precise place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
The believers travel the Rue de la Souffrance or the Way of the Cross (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the pretoire), where the trial was held, then led through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the Anointing and the tomb.
This is where the Christian center of the world stands, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to the Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people from different faiths leave small words with prayers there, which are then answered.
Travel high
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, former refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 B.C. for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can go there by their own means.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, lies the ski resort of Mont Hermont, which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to have once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth a visit.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It houses the ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the Judean Desert caves, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
The paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are mainly exhibited.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of casts of visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum or Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter in total darkness.
Stars are shimmering.
You then hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and welfare
Israel's three major seaside resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each one offers swimming pools, water parks, delphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the temperature of the water does not fall below 21° while the temperature of the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, i.e. 417 m below sea level.
The azure-coloured water contains brine and very easily retains bathers, even those who cannot swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of surrealistic beauty.
We come to perform a treatment based on salt water, silt, curative sludge and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of Antiquity
They are guarded by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists especially like to stroll through the narrow alleyways that bear the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile on you.
In Jaffa you will be able to meet newlyweds who have come to make photo sessions of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre, "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, especially Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, because they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar equals 3.8 shekels).
As far as urban transport is concerned, it is mainly the buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, composed of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturdays, markets, shops and public transport cease to operate.
And the working week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafés, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes made with lamb and beef, soups and desserts made with coconut milk but also hummus, traditional Jewish dough, various sauces, ground chickpea balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats who walk around in the haughty air.
We can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars in the evening.
These felines love passing places and don't refuse to treat them.
The rental of a car varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of the figures
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mostly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists visited Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011.
"Who language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists are arguing about what the law on mandatory language testing will give, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law had entered into force and stipulated that every migrant worker would have to pass a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language, but also of the history of Russia and the foundations of law, will have to be validated.
You will have to validate your knowledge of Russian in order to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Persons who obtained educational certificates or diplomas prior to the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not covered by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of Peoples Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to take exams in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders have asked the question in the press many times: what will it be?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, answer the representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery at work".
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the Russian Federal Migration Service office in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellow men will torment themselves for months without food and paper and will have to work between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive numerous complaints from our migrants.
"There is one thing we promise them, and when they arrive, we deceive them, we take their passport, and they do not receive the salary they expect," confirms Tolib Charipov, Head of the Directorate of Migration Services for Labour of the Migration Service of Tajikistan.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many Central Asian republic nationals who wish to come to Russia to earn money say that they do not only not know the language of the country to which they wish to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford to attend even fair primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's difficult when you don't know the language, they confide.
"You feel diminished and diminished."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the Language Act.
The examinations will be intended only for migrants with legal status.
Without a statute, there will be no formal examination or work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or Defence to Enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then, you can get a fake recording quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we don't have a record, hence the cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, enough to buy cigarettes, tea", told journalists Umed Khushkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan.
"Make it quick, don't skimp and buy yourself a beautiful piece of art"
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that migrants' registration papers were not the only ones that were false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The falsified papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: each migrant who thus hoped to facilitate the task of the examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Government representatives and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "paper sticks".
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination on the first occasion the time to take language courses.
Moreover, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian weapons carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it is the shootings carried out during weddings or the killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to ban the wearing of rubber bullet weapons in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a licence to carry a weapon from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma's Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the arms law would be introduced in the State Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various firing centres, demanded to abandon "this insane hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, said Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from buying from the black market.
According to them, today in Moscow we can find any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the distribution of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
There are five main canals, says Victor Baranets, retired colonel who served ten years at the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking arms commands
The first is the "military trace", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians," Baranets explains.
The second type of black market weapons are those stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stocks and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go for sale from military warehouses.
Many of the latter have often suffered explosions.
"Attested versions indicate that some fires were deliberately triggered to cover up the deficit," says the former military officer.
For Baranets, the weapons manufacturers are responsible for something.
"We see private arms factories that don't compete on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," one expert says.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A significant proportion of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes craft production, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply," adds the former military.
Where did the weapons come from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of illegal weapons in the black market for each source.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analysed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal files and public data on weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the army and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found there "by fault of employees whose work is related to weapons", it is explained in the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from military conflict sites, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "undercover searches".
A seller and consultant of an armory who asked to remain anonymous ensures that for a long time no one buys the weapons found by these secret search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, he says, sellers will pick up new goods from military warehouses.
The person buys a unit, such as a TT gun, through a sign.
We deliver it to him by passing the goods through a fence.
"He transports it to town and sells it for 900 € per unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so when crimes are about to be solved, they make a purchase of control from illegal arms dealers," the seller adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I visited sites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered me to come to the Begovaya train station where someone was going to take me in a "corner" to bargain.
The price of the gun, they gave it to me on the spot.
Victor Baranets as military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the salesman. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers on the markets, but there you have to come there also by saying, for example, "From such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter has lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of someone I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give them to him.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Victor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, according to him, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
"I thought I was in a luxury store," recalls the soldier.
There is no secret to the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, we go with the forest salesman and set up a target.
"They let me shoot and when I'm convinced that the gun works well, we start negotiating," the expert describes.
A shop from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
To do this, we don't need any documents and no one to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise amount of money," one writes in advertising on the website "Buy a gun or a combat machine gun".
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to the miners?
"No license, of course", asks the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of fake sites and is picking up people who want to buy combat weapons.
People rush to food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia.

I have heard of this type of scheme: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take the lead.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the "Right to a weapon" association, Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, you can find yourself unarmed and behind bars.

One Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "Right to a weapon" association, one can buy a Makarov gun for 100-300 dollars.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
He was removed from the long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the Ministry's official data, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles, while the proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
United States: Employees of fast food and supermarkets on strike
Almost a quarter of American teens go through cashier work at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has been mounted against the low wages of Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave is going to expand or blow out quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In parallel with the increase in the modest wages received by basic workers at Walmart and in fast food chains, the organizers of the events want to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests started last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", at a time when a pouring rain of sales taking hold of millions of inhabitants fell on America and sometimes triggering sclanders.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs to organize pickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in the company's stores whose products are intended for consumers of the modest and middle classes.
Walmart markets everything: from diapers to shotguns to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
This is why many low-paid employees at Walmart shop only at their workplace.
Price and product choice have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products, especially because of the low salaries of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of portable forklifts or scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" protests demanded a salary increase, they complained that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the base employee at Walmart who earns $9.5 an hour, that's a sum he can't afford.
Scientists at the California University of Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
This is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all wage increases to consumers, every race in the store would be 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12.39 more in one year than they do now.
Walmart's supporters are pleased to note that the protests took place in only nine states and did no harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in the stores from 8 a.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold on this period 5000 items per second.
His crates carried out a total of 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".
The spokesman for the Dan Fogleman company assured in an interview at the left-wing site Huffington Post that in all "less than five" Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a "com' operation among so many others" on the part of the organizing union.
"Next client!"
The protests continued this week in New York City and were not about Walmart stores (in this progressive city they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet there) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-foods increase over time, but on average, their base employees earn $8.90 an hour in New York.
Nobody touches less than them in this town.
For me it's inconceivable to live with that money in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum there are comments that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, a multiplication more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union protesters through bullying or dismissal.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, grabbing fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the most important is the extraordinary turnover of staff.
They don't agree.
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the mid-day rally near McDonald's in Times Square with the intervention of several local democrat politicians, including Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly!".
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, including Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we all need to support fast food workers to get a fair wage and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the most important event in the fast food industry in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated and not all of them were fast-food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult for the moment to say whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
"At the moment, we only manage to deceive the brain"
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was reported that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Microsoft Laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, it appears that the glasses are already of ancient history for the scientists of this company.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We work on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we try to widen the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the time being with pixels on flat screen and sometimes with touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in control by gesture.
- What does the future hold for us, too?
- Although the Kinect has made physical interaction, a lot of things happen on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information entry has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance at this time, not really.
We're trying to change that and we're working on truly 3D imaging systems that work on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We must bring the computer world out into ours, into the physical world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space surrounding it.
Thus, we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
It cannot be said that this is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of his actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each one in its niche.
For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the camera, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass that can?
You'd do it with the word and the gestures.
- I usually only talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can not do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These can be laser sensors for example, they produce quite good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what don't you like about modern cameras?
They lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be nice to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, adding work to algorithm designers.
We must keep in mind the resolution according to axes X and Y, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s are really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, of our Redmond laboratory, gave the sensor touch a steady processing delay of between 1 and 100 μs, with the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device of this type in my work, but not to touch, to have more frames on the second.
- But shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define the locations.
- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around with a smartphone with your hands up is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be an augmented reality "transitional" that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and that is what makes their strength (the personal elements are the ones you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is only accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to mere mortals.
There is one problem that opponents of this idea point at: there is no tactile sensation!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your group's responses to this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
At the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image medium.
It perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are really intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasound rays directed to a precise point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the fingertips.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also an axis of work presenting perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried yet.
There is still a task below which it will take a long time to get hurt: how to make someone who is physically in a very small space think that he is walking in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we only manage to deceive the brain on average, there are still many years of work left.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The peterbourgeois avant-garde" dedicated to the urban dwellers who are in advance, to the avant-garde of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the St.Petersburg art scene whose achievements extend beyond the city border and who have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extrovert painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that you can meet near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in trendy parties and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always bring together crowds, no matter where they were exhibited.
He is one of the peterbourgeois storytellers fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the peterbourgeois vanguard of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands an organ of Barbarian and he became the symbol of this instrument in St.Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role by its existence, its philosophy and its image of Bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you travel the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a tailor specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not grey causes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my works were located.
I realized it was my way.
Then the wave of unofficial old painters had passed and the new ones, free, of my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to be friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Puchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to be at the centre of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must gather.
In 1995, I took my place in Pushkinskaya-10, which housed before the works a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the peterbourgeois bohemian.
Many were born there: The NAME, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arriving with the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy-to-play back songs in tight jerseys, among them Igor Vdovin, a modern composer.
When the band started to perform live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg animated a lot of shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his training and basic education, it was with us that he received them.
Galerie "D137", Club "Gridoïedov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees left as regulars.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named Painter of the Year, and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong topicality and acuity.
I'm going to have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum Through Clowns."
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it's scary to be like this.
But with clowns, everything fades, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we have to spit in his face.
And the lie will be erased by the disguise.
Recently we've seen you in the role of Barbarian organ player.
Who other than me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be treated, delicate, liqueurous.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into herds, bohemian supporters loved one thing, denied another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Every star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw away who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come and at the end of the day it's less management, less money, everything is dying.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that usually are the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money precisely for painting.
I'm in favour of this culture.
Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand the culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow today there are good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are out of the way, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and pave the way for them.
Currently, it is the "regnate of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- What do you think is St. Petersburg?
- St Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for this.
And on our stones, art has a hard time pushing.
We need cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this layer is very thin.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Delivering in Space
Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with Earthmen on board set out to search for a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a great question arises: how can we continue to live our species in weightlessness or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
"It's Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the surface temperature of Venus is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitudes or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on the issues of space reproduction by focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, we were experimenting with plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from earth varieties.
Insects, small breeding drosophila flies, were then put into orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to see how a weightless embryo developed.
We get out a perfectly normal chick.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is related to the fact that the chick must find a support, he must get on his feet and start to move," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By not finding any support, the chicks shook disorderly.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
"We shook their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, observing the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature arch" with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the "Bion" biosatellite will only ship species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still about biosatellites and then it's the only experiment. We have to do this kind of research," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions are not yet possible directly in space.
It's not a big deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike beasts, man is capable of it, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, he is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been going into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the feminine organism is what humanity has most precious.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the robbery.
"No one answered this question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadze, retired from the rocket and space sectors.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been in orbit twice and even working in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts that have had nothing and that give birth to healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it poses a danger even during flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: compulsory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train at extra-vehicular exits.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults, the water is comfortable but however a foreign environment, for infants, this is their real element.
The small amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby progresses about 9 months in the lymph fluid of his mother's stomach, it is easier to get used to water.
This is in principle logical, because from his birth until his first bath, it happens only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly and pelvis atrophy very quickly, the baby's ability to push is lost.
All right, let's just ignore this by relying on the birth simulators.
We can of course prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will manage to get him out.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite reflection on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the Earth's attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or muscle system.
You can't dress an infant like an adult with a special combination for workouts.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely disabled," says the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still theory.
However, with time this will become a reality, when the Earthlings travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their space-born offspring.
The head of the ISC (Superior Audit Institution of Public Finance) said: "the control of pseudo self-employment (in Czech "Système Švarc") failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is lagging behind in its implementation.
This was stated by Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Higher Audit Institution in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is missing from us," Kala said in her comment on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice Petr Nečas' approach to the Švarc system.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the ODS was not going to bother contractors with controls, so is it allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it forbids something, even the head of government cannot prevent an inspection authority from acting to demand compliance," Kala says.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project in which the public procurement legislation of these two countries was compared.
What was the concrete question?
This is a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation and a practice itself.
We have gathered all this together and although this monitoring procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have arisen: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more severe and of better quality", but according to certain parameters, the practice itself is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to draw up ever more detailed rules continuously, but that it is necessary to devote itself to the very implementation of the law.
How can this project help you in practice and what does it mean for you?
Common control of this kind should help us to stop trying to clarify laws, to lower and improve thresholds, where this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering market thresholds will not necessarily achieve this objective.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by red tape that those looking for loopholes will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our SAI or a different organization?
As for the institutions, similar to the SCI, the Bundesrechnungshof functions there, which is organised in a similar way, it also has a council constituted a little differently, but these two institutions basically proceed in a similar way.
The powers are also, to a certain extent, similar, albeit with a nuance in relation to our system: since Germany is a federal structure, it therefore also has such courses of account at the level of the various Länder.
The HRB can only control federal money, which in our country corresponds to the resources of the state.
The public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the Länder's accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it is doing better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better detectives?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I do not have any comparative data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we see as a model, is also confronted with a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage in cooperating with our institution, wouldn't they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has been meant for you, as an institution, by the amendment of the law on public procurement, are its effects already being felt?
As this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we carry out ex post checks, there is a certain delay.
Our comments relate only, for the time being, to the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new "mismanagement risk detection" instrument with which we have screened nearly 14 000 public contracts - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed and the conditions for certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law to be more of an advantage or an additional burden on the administration?
I believe that this legislation is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm that.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulations, the provider (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced the controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the contract law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal mistakes without affecting the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what's the solution to get out of this?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS was not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from acting to inspect and demand compliance with the law.
He can declare: "We will change the law and authorize it", but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing had happened.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder should be eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that, in my opinion, is what is lacking in us.
Roads are frozen in places, but most remain practicable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snow-covered.
However, most of the network remains workable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary area, the roads were this morning practicable, but in frozen and also snow-covered places.
Temperatures have dropped and range from -5° to -10°C but are expected to rise slightly during the day.
Snowfall has stopped in the area and only a thin layer of snow remains on the plains.
However, the ridges of the Metalliferous Mountains (Krušné hory) are covered by about 30 centimetres of snow.
Data from the regional road maintenance service indicate that fog caused visibility to be reduced in areas.
The R6 expressway and the national roads of the region are now easily accessible.
However, vigilance is still needed, for example on certain bridges whose surface can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
Some of their sections still contain frozen snow leftovers and in places packed by traffic.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to increase their vigilance.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové regions
The Highways and Highways Directorate reports on its website that certain roads in Eastern Bohemia are threatened by ice formation and that snow layers packed with traffic may be found on roads in mountainous and high-altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in high-altitude areas of the Pardubice region.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoke Mýto, mainly on departmental and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Knñnou and Trutnov, a layer of traffic-laden snow is present on roads in areas at altitude.
In the Eastern Bohemia it will be dry, most often clear today with cloudy weather.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will generally oscillate between -3 ° and + 1 ° C.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen area are now practicable, although in some places there is a need for increased vigilance and adaptation to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures vary between -3 °C and -9 °C.
After the last snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communication routes may be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to cross fog areas, however, visibility will gradually improve.
This is reflected in the information provided by the Regional Road Maintenance Service.
The D5 motorway is almost easy to operate, but road communication maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The surface of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections may be frozen in the South Pilsen District and in the Tachov District.
The departmental and third category lanes are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on the less frequented roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc region
Drivers travelling to high-altitude areas of the Olomouc region must now count with a thick, soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" pass and on the road towards Videlský k
The snowfall forced the road maintenance personnel to go to the field last night; according to the road services, it fell more than three centimetres in the district of Šumperk.
In the other parts of the region, most pavements are easily accessible.
" On the heights of the Šumperk district are snow remains.
Drivers travelling towards Jeseník should expect to meet a thick and soft snow layer at the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" pass today told ČTK the head of road maintenance services in the Šumperk district.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also visited the area during the night; according to them, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are easily accessible, in the district of Šternberk the drivers should however pay attention in sections in forest areas to the wet pavements.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, maintenance services on the northern Bohemia roads reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some areas covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, and therefore snow and ice are expected to remain on the roads. On the plains, especially to the southeast of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there are no problems on the contrary, and roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice, particularly in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snowmelt during the day, clear skies and freezing during the night.
From the main traffic routes, difficult conditions are also reported on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have bent under the weight of snow until reaching the road.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our band The Tap Tap, we laugh at it rather and we think that we are the only group able to collect a rest of positive energy in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you set up a completely unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
It's a charity that we've been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end almost at the end of the Mayan calendar on Kiribati Island in the Pacific Ocean, in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who had this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world entitled "End of the World Cancelled " (in Czech " Konec světa zrušeno ").
She is already very popular on YouTube, will we hear her also at these charity concerts?
Of course, at the end, at last, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in all three concerts.
The anthems will also join at some point as part of a unique live programme on Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tom+ Hanák who also plays the main role of Jesus in the music video, Xindl X also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize numerous concerts and charitable events...
We strive to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world be?
To equip the Studeo training centre, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on as part of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedličkův Institute and offer them activities that interest and amuse them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Several music groups and performers will go on stage during each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, do you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere will stage with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji+ Suchý.
Full details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the Prague Spring; here too, we will surely prepare a quality programme with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the Czech Republic's house in New York and personally, once we're in the United States, I'd like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so bad that it looks like it at first.
We have five members in electric wheelchairs whose gear must travel in the hold, of course we also carry a lot of luggage and instrument boxes....
So far everything has gone more or less well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that in the east all are still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to travel alone by electric wheelchair in the city centre.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association is being set up to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
How do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to note that improvements and improvements continue to depend on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point you, The Tap Tap, are on the contrary at the cutting edge of progress!
Respect for the public and ease of access are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have among us famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
For the time being, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what led you in 1998 to create this band?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And since I am a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), together with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Lêa Angelovič says, we lost control of the situation a little bit (laughs).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I'm not mistaken?
It's true, creating links with known singers and actively working to promote the band helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it does not exist in the background.
Thanks to EU subsidies, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you aim to achieve such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was potential to change things.
The show business is full of stuff that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it's natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, whom we must take pity.
They are people who can live a full life and flourish, provided they have the necessary means, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities achieve something, it is not just a step forward for them but for the whole of society.
Isn't your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we need to be intransigent in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think it's quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and a head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, Lêa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people go in and out, we can't help it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, Brno in Fleda and Ostrava in the Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relay when the song of the band The Tap Tap "End of the World Cancelled" will be sung together.
The purpose of the concert is to gather financial resources (CZK 25 million) to equip the multifunctional training centre Studeo in Prague in the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years old, pre-sale tickets is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the Agency, being the second member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and in the following years participated in a number of Agency projects.
However, Poland's journey to space began much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, at which he presented ideas from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left the cold listeners and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr.Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his work "Introduction à l'astronautique".
Dr.Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a world-renowned astronaut, his contribution was rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the hidden side of the Moon.
As early as 1925, in Poland, a train was built to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket should be used to propel or brake the draisine.
The only known information on this practice is that of the press of the time.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to focus on rockets.
The research was carried out by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
The documents kept show that this search had reached the stage of testing.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search stopped.
In 1937, plans for a photoelectric hunting rocket, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were designed to use rocket engines for military purposes.
Just before the war, all plans for the use of rocket technology were led by the provisional scientific advisory committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war put an end to its activities.
After the war, further work on aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, a company was mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Problem, in which four more detailed articles on aeronautics were published.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the international Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and in the autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the international astronautic federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the weather rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version was built, RM-1A, and during the summer of 1959, testing of the two-stage RM-2 rocket began in the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket, developed during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded the first RM rockets.
This rocket, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they distinguished themselves by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B it was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C it was 0.62 litres.
The maximum range of all these types of gear was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the Aeronautical Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Poland's entry into the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later are worth mentioning.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this programme.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision raised a lively public discussion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberalist-oriented economic systems, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means in practical terms that the different economic entities and national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour prices (wages) create a pressure on prices.
The meaning of this term should be understood as meaning that a producer tries to resist economic competition by making the competitor's price more expensive, with the aim of removing a greater share of the market and thus increasing its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, buying at low prices or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the State's social charges necessarily increase.
This whole situation intensifies the complete unwillingness of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create a situation in the various economies in which the governments of the various countries are forced to enter into a mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to force its own population economically to accept the diktat of private capital prices, particularly in the area of wages.
This is due, on the one hand, to a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, to the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
The result is increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, there have been public food distribution points for the poor for years who cannot provide for themselves with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the State is obliged to pay a supplement in order to reach the minimum subsistence level.
Such a scandal has, for example, been brought up to date in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all the Member States of the southern EU undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century) or to live with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
Here the question must be asked: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will change from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media say, tired of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
We must then ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence and, even, does not control today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same token, the entire state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
This is demonstrated by the fact that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby in all states.
This results in a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual advantages, in legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the drafting of laws to law firms closely linked to industry.
These bills are then passed by the Bundestag.
The totality of power does not come from the people, as the Western-style constitutions say, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberalist-oriented democracies are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Times of Caesar and Pompey": "The state had long since been in disarray and the functions were attributed by violence.
Bribery, favours obtained illegally, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The under-tables and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with votes already sold out" ... ... "Honest people did not seek to obtain office, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls". ... "It was really beginning to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man" ... It is true that Appianos had in mind Pompey, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the current society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interest of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and asserting the interests of society as a whole.
The result, now as in the past, is an unprecedented decadence of elites, without any effort to carry out in-depth reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the present state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracies can be regarded as a sort of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises we witness today and the crimes against humanity as we know them from past and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international level and at the European internal level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways of reducing the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will be able," says Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse of the chorus is "don't forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons didn't want wars, there wouldn't be wars," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, there have been many reactions.
Some take the side of Israel, asserting its right to self-defence and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and viewing Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is victimized in its waves of recurrent killings; all in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a view "behind the curtain", on the one to which mainly benefit the tensions that have already persisted for more than 95 years (from the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to study, others emerge from my own understanding of that, or more precisely of the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At each time, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individualities acted independently or whether they owed their actions to the throne to someone who directed their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We have to admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration that generates certain powers could not have taken place over a single generation.
Among families with astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
By the 1990s of the 19th century, they had acquired the first worldwide news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their names and serious criminal acts in which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortune or both.
They own major holdings in almost most of the world's central banks and prepare or wage wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only of 4, in the meantime Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of central bank to the Bank of America of the Rothschild and began to issue his own money during the civil war (I hear it well) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began issuing clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to initiate a lawsuit against the EDF for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a freemason initiated in the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating Europe's great state monarchies, the second at eliminating colonialism, especially British colonialism, and the third at reducing the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), creating a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and ultimately acquiring absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with the Rothschild at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the EDF intended to prevent the recurrence of crises such as those they caused in 1907).
After having succeeded in starting the first world war with the assassination in Sarajevo of Habsburg's heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers let the politicians create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed terrible war reparations on Germany thus generating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (they then only had to place a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing out the finger of the guilty, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia made up of different nationalities, including a strong German minority which had to play the role (which it actually held) of the fifth column to set fire to the powders and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the foundation for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it was difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had originally held him; or whether everything he had done was planned, the fact is that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel lit a firehouse that could cause a third world war.
If the international bankers manage to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people bitterly divide among supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is victimized in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong leads to another wrong according to an endless circle of violence and where one finds, at the origin of everything, the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
We must make a difference here between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only propose to people in elections their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything in order to trigger a war with Iran, which, because of this country's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) could expand to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz through which 20 percent of all world oil (this naval corridor is only 2 miles wide) flows and results in the destruction of the world economy.
In what light now appear the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth as an electronic chip making it a completely controlled being.
"Let them compel all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to bear on their hands or foreheads a mark with red iron, so that he may neither buy nor sell any one who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that one who has good sense counts the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number refers to the man and it's six hundred and sixty-six."
The film Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who had been supporting his regime for several decades.
The situation did not give the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, further aggravated by the fiasco of the attempt to liberate the hostages by force.
The detained diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate stirred up a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered America a small victory.
Just before she was busy, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated events, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran with a rocky cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who came to make scouts for the shooting of a science fiction show.
Combination of genders
The plan of exfiltration expert Tony Mendez requires Hollywood collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialist magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were held and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation were long secret, the film being based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistically designed political thriller but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, a treachery - as, for example, in the Ocean's eleven, Twelve and Thirteen trilogy.
The atmospheres follow each other: documentary-style Tehran sequences (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no big differences),
lighter Hollywood passages, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
And then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting ceased to elicit ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It's also Affleck's first film that doesn't take place in his home town, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity which also suggests confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in fictional scenes (the fake shooting team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to settle for a subject that actually offered few thrilling scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
He is doing very well, he sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is removed by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the airstrip is quite drawn by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood coopers, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he lets himself be seen with moderate interest, enjoying the realization and retro style of the 70s.
It trains the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a history still, in a certain way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omnicious, it does the job.
Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry into the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU has recently planned to adopt a quota of 40 per cent of women for the management of large European companies has been at the root of our decision," said the organizer of this survey, Patrik Nacher, for the newspaper Právo.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women have benefited from life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," informed Nacher.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the requirement to add bio-components to fuels, which has adverse environmental consequences, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, solely because they contain a relatively small amount of a hazardous substance, or the hen cage size directive, which has led to higher egg prices.
Criticism has also been expressed in the past about the de facto prohibition of the use of the term "butter to spread" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimetres tall.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of states (for example, the Czech Republic currently imposes demands on its banks by threatening to use its veto power).
The interests of pressure groups are also responsible, for example, for the fact that bananas in the Union must not be less than 14 cm tall or have an "abnormal curve".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonising non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite opposition from some States, claiming that the existing directives result in a waste of food.
The first prize may be awarded in this investigation to last year's EU regulation that must include on inflatable balloons a warning that children under 8 years of age must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU referred to an American survey that found balloons among toys to be the leading cause of child deaths from suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when blowing in fair trumpets.
We've got some weird ideas in our house too.
The following rule concerning European civil servants themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this topic to Greece, anyone with an official function in the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and should instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the liberal economists' association "Let Dossez", the Bankovnípoplatky.com server named in this survey, in addition to some absurdities mentioned above, the Union Regulation concerning the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and, as a result, risked a heavy fine.
The organisers of this survey found the idea of paying money to certain countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to apply for subsidies to be interesting.
These ideas, however, do not originate from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea handicaps us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund." In autumn 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) spoke.
He argued that, as a result of our wheat production, and following so-called interventionist purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks that it had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to Czech demand and organised a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for obtaining grants were proposed to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), and these were to be used, in practice, to draft applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "Weird regulations are rare".
While regulations are often criticized by many experts in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning and its overall development deserve praise.
More serious is, for example, according to experts, the problem of using EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (which it does not always win) arouses strong emotions among Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarفارسىky", for what of the name "Tuzemský rum" that dates back to us in the nineteenth century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only cane sugar alcohol products, not beet sugar, may be called rum.
The official list of EU registered products now includes world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, Karlovy Vary biscuits ("Karlovarské Suchary"), Pohořelice and Třebo+ ("Pohořelický a Třebo+ský kapr") and Žatec ("Žatecký chmel") hops.
Pardubice gingerbread ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Hořice cornets" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their Community trade mark.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura.
Senator, how do we have the idea of running for president?
It's not being a senator or chair that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn't be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer bear to see how the country has been looted for the past twenty years, that thieves are not locked in and taxes and the retirement age is increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, then I try to find a way to make it change.
And since I am more than forty years old and I am independent, a member of no party, I have no other options to influence the situation than to stand in the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but quickly set out for the Castle (N.D.T.: seat of the Presidency).
Don't you turn your back on those who elected you?
I've always said that I'll start the battle for the Castle according to the results of the senatorial elections.
Later, I said that if I was elected as a senator, I would run in the presidential election.
My purpose is not the function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we grumble at the bar or in front of our television set, but also that we trample on those who are trying to bring about change.
In addition, the press breaks people's reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was told that I bribed the journalists or that I was the adviser to Ji+ Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You started the fight for the Castle with the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax declarations in excess of twenty million [CZK].
To that end, you must change the law.
As Speaker, you do not have such a power and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I lobbied for a liberal profession for tourist guide activities, I won.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from left or right with a good project, it is deliberately refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorisation and partisan dogma, to take from each side what is best for our country and implement it.
You think you're more like a man on the right or left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are putting me on the left.
For me, whether it's a little to the left or to the right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we're moving forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right, but that people are gathered together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS, and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you're a populist?
But doesn't what you said prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have talked about it.
But without the support of parliament, all you have left are slogans.
You won't survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I must convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my side in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then eventually explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality who will identify abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct vote, it was obtained thanks to the pressure of public opinion.
I confess, without a doubt, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I have just entered politics and am trying to get the support of the majority for my programme.
I'm trying alone to get things moving, and if it doesn't work out, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can't make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities and asked them to run for the Senate as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed fuel oil fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty per cent of the people did not vote, and most of the people who did so gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that will hardly be able to impose change.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and regional prefects.
Are you planning to form your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I don't have any money for my presidential campaign either, I only have twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property to be about 60 million.
I have in Prague a plot worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid's dream: I've always loved James Bond, who used to drive, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You ride in Aston Martin, you have a heritage worth 60 million and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I get into debt?
I've already invested two and a half million dollars in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program does not attract much interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign out of my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live on it, for example, paying my son's English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I won't run for office.
So you're going to continue your business activities so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd be deaf to your activities?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take over the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I was winning and I'm still winning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would put an end to my business activities.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Práva.
The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To be convinced, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, at last something interesting to see," Lisette Verhaig tells us, a passerby on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a large neighboring company, tells us: "Yes, it is indeed beautiful, this building".
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one is willingly going to one of these ringuard libraries anymore, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeper town that is not attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, has a rather special record.
The commune of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brains, the city decided a few years ago to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro notes in the form of pretty small miniatures of painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
Thus the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get their hands on statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, of the architect's office in Rotterdam MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of witty and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and presented himself to the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a snitch on his face.
And while the members of the jury still looked at each other, disconcerted and shoving their shoulders, Maas, shocked him, stacked his books of choice in order of size to make them a pyramid, and finished his speech supported by militant arguments by a: "honey common!"
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the €30 million mountain sprang from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and adjoining houses for a total of 50 dwellings.
In early November, the book mountain received the second "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, this dull little town, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a town hall of a staggering uglyness, whose white facades invite to think that they house a dairy, has been enriched by a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the cheese bell book.
True, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, but the true joys of reading and architecture open to you when you walk down the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and the elegant lamps speak unequivocally the language of the municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We're already looking at public benches, dogs and little boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally, library shelves are located along the façade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," says Willy Maas.
We have completely changed the classic spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from inside to outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been skillfully arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes paneling, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircase ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the hardened building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in a Frisian farm.
In the Netherlands, synthetic membranes with a thickness of one millimetre have been used for years as substrates in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we're saving time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into four centimetres thick plates.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes colour and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 metres, the literary café offers a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and potted ficus.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to the maintenance of the ideal level of humidity of the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the new soul
"It's incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is set by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is under a glass bell, the sun only illuminates the interior for a short time, even on days of fine weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted across from the glass façade serve as a sun visor, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
Completely automated blinds handle the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic computer scientist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there, too.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "recovered soul".
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure has made it possible to fill the gaps in the library which was not yet completely filled (today it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has reached the master discipline which is called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
Even though she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans need to play a bigger role."
Germany chose abstention in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request for observer state status with the United Nations.
But then she chose abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but was not too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 uprising in Libya, Germany also chose to abstain in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany have any difficulty in adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so to speak defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore clashed with several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe they are still trying to find this role, but are on the way to a 'more normal' foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
What does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for the Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, thus by its exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the Middle East conflict and its abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany first has important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to clash with public opinion, but also with the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a determining factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, because it is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a decisive factor in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany undermine its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I believe that the fracture is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will be even more respected.
Indeed, Germany has demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you observe the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm for Netanyahu's policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think it makes things easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but this is not the case today.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
That is what they are currently doing about the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will play a locomotive role in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This issue has always been a delicate one.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself playing a leading role on the international stage, does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or does it still have difficulty in taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still has difficulties in playing a more important role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
In fact, it's always the same problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to deal with very diverse neighbours and opinions, and that's not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is diminishing, but at the moment the EU is not filling this void, so who remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're less appreciated, it's life!

"Trademark protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name is an officially registered trademark in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the undertaking bearing its name cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, it is not certain that she would win the case.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a firm specializing in violating property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators only need a few additional letters to register their trademarks.
So instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods.
Pattloch opens a file containing the registrations made at the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by owning part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become world champions of copying and infringement of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell virtually nothing but counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his constituents charge him with tackling the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese talk about "Bang Mingpai", a relative brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are referred to.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame for.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and legal costs amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to expensive flagship products.
According to data from the analysis company of the market CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest growing one.
However, it is not easy to remove questionable registrations from the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last for up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch referred to the trials in which the court dismissed the complaint, because after a long period of time the term criticized had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains to us that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist because he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump producer Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's successor, used a blue and white logo that resembled BMW's. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost against the plagiarists of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO trademark office in Beijing admits to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, last year the Office would have moved from an "emergency situation in the course of work to a recovered normality".
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22%.
Almost 57,000 cases of this type were reported to have been closed, an increase of 75% over the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 proceedings remain outstanding at the Office.
It's expensive to act.
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and it means that China is for the tenth consecutive time at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal trademarks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office would have recorded 1.8 billion yuan of registration fees.
In other words, each record yielded an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Of course, the Germans were able to obtain a suspension of the illegal manufacture of vehicle components.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights in the Freudenberg trade mark.
"It's our fault because last names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office had therefore rejected the Munichers' objection.
Freudenberg has certainly won the case in the following two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is in order
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "The procedure is long, difficult and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to estimate internal costs. The Archives Service even had to review the records of the past 100 years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg even proposed to the opposing party in vain a "big six-digit euro sum" to settle the dispute.
"That's what it means to us," Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to spill over into Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region ensured the exploitation of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file in Germany the name Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it had still been able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "vigilance is in order".
Pattloch and he advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, in their view, to rely on international trademark law, that foreigners should rather "register also in China anything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of its legal drama, the company would have to pay license fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place in the segment of the market in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland rejoice in their arrival.
This is the story of a link that crosses far more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we kick: cowboy boots, sneakers, skids for ladies and moccasins for men look for the rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers grow slowly - viola, bass, tenor and soprano - they get carried away, bewitch and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost loses his canvas shoes when he directs the orchestra with his wildly flexible gestures.
It's Monday night, the Imbongi choir repeats a new song in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty singers and singers aged 23 to 69 have come, from the geneticist in human medicine to the man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choir player has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
To be helped to help each other
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are living with the disease.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the "Voices for Africa" association.
70 of them attend secondary schools.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a godfather.
This money guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo centre.
Imbongi means in Zulu "story storyteller" or "singer of praise".
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this region, but all can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany to now return it to its native region: South Africa.
Because at 8,733 kilometers as the bird flies from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of straw or land and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, as HIV has taken away their parents.
In Esitjeni, Swaziland's ills can be seen on a smaller scale: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population is infected with the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the middle of their thirties.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. Imbongis especially saw many children in the street who were missing not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is simply no perspective.
At first, they were only a few people who personally committed themselves to paying a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since almost professionally cared for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Pubis lice and scabies belong to parasitic STIs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhea often occur in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are caused by sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, about 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections are among young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In addition, in Germany, human papillomavirus is common among young people.
What is the trend in the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years: the number has increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been declining.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one-tenth over the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause genital abscesses, urinary pain, white discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, and the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or by close bodily contact.
The experts therefore recommend that any person who often changes sexual partners take regular exams.
Most rapidly detected STIs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds raised by the singers thanks to their voices throughout Germany, the means are accumulating.
"In all, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well housed, for example in one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, so called the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them host up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and ensure that they go to school every day on time in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is accommodated in a safe place at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare daily meals for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two hen houses. With the help of the American health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many inhabitants.
This is not self-evident, for although the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a taboo," explains Annette Lennartz, "because it is a subject that touches sexuality."
It's rather curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These State-sanctioned morals, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
However, condoms can be found on every corner of the street," adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to encourage some cultural exchange, Imbongi's choirs travel together every two or three years to South Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still experience during the time of apartheid.
The bus full of whites singing in the African language is a sign of recognition such that it generates not only good humor and joy, but sometimes also tears away a tear from some fearsome border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the choirs visit their godson.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there," say the people there.
And after a trip of 8,733 kilometers as the crow flies, back to Heidelberg, in front of these choruses who tap their feet in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could be as thick as 20 metres.
The American space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the specialist journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of an ice cover in the area of the planet that is constantly plunged into the shadows.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimetres up to 20 metres.
The water probably comes from comets or maybe from asteroids that would have struck Mercury.
However, no one makes a connection between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other life-critical elements arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Unseen of the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like small interstices through which one observes infinity.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborns" in the birth hall of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where stars are born, called "W5", a name that is not very romantic, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flamboyant glow of a dying star.
The donut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the immense Trifide nebula, at 5,400 light years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, a cluster of stars also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope makes the colours more visible.
In this infrared photo, the Helica nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
His resemblances to a land continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo makes it possible to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
Depending on the colour, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifide nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light years away.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dust drags divide the glowing heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation of the Serpentaire: 400 million light-years from the Earth, the nuclei of two molten galaxies rush to each other, collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Southern Fire Wheel".
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the Iris nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than the common household dust.
This photo was developed from optical and radiographic photographs taken by different telescopes.
It shows the circle composed of black holes which is located 430 million light years from the Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies named Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette nebula, also permanently create young stars 5,000 light-years from the Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists think he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was largely composed of hydrogen.
Our look at the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was allegedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of the Palomar Mountain Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this picture had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter nevertheless reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great light collection capacity.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help with the "Search for Extraterrestral Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extra-terrestrial intelligence") by using the computing power of his machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The construction of a European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 metres each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory that observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new gigantic telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 metres.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important space images come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been giving us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
The mission of the telescope will be to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that Mercury's South Pole is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data for decades indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97.
The journey through the Talysh Mountains is a complete romanticism.
At the turn of the many turns of the road, the small bus cahoots along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
It's all green and fertile, it's almost like the Black Forest.
But here we are in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group, called Talysh, lives, about which we do not know much, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azeri and that they have a very long lifespan.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plastrons with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era which does not at all agree with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one lane.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, 48-year-old Pilata Fatulayeva is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva explains.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
We can discover the lives of about eight dozen Talysh of the region who are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
Have one more child at 136 years old
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when one thinks that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva says.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a daughter.
Would Şirali Müslümov have been wrong for a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard of the man of the great age of Central Asia.
"Amazingly elderly people also live in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz explains, "also in Sardinia, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the lack of documentation, and there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
However, it is true that people in the Lerik area often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
However, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it is a matter of food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem plausible that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink daily a glass of melted butter, are good for their health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village close to the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground next to a bar, whose content she beats tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, who have long been adults.
Two little children are also swarming in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical armadus glasses in the shape of a belly.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf hide long braids of a dark blonde whom his son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and they kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never bought anything in a supermarket in my whole life.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda is astounding in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who has led his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, after which his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly people of Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats (about the same amount as in euros) monthly for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-graying son is right: "the elders enjoy great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
The “human rights” omitted from the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Opposite demonstrations reveal the deep fracture of the country.
The draft constitution based on sharia law is violently controversial.
The Egyptian President is not stupefied by words full of emotion.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he declared on state television.
His speech was intended for the entire people, but also especially for Christian Copts, Liberals, enlightened Muslims and lay people.
Because all members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost by apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its powers "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer wants to save, who holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 hastily written articles by the predominantly Islamic Constituent Assembly of 100 people during a 15-hour night tour of power are indeed disturbing to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal leeway to apply a stricter interpretation of sharia law.
In any case, it is suggested by a newly introduced article stipulating that, with regard to all matters relating to Shariah, al-Azhar University must be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance radiates throughout the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative machinery, which would de facto lead to the guardianship of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is the likely continuation of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts tried to repress the opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The project also states that the State must protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematographic art and literature.
In short, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, there is no article that expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording implying that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a cartoon of the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a lawman?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft which Morsi put to the vote and which, in his own words, will be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians "very soon".
"The Revolution Reborn"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down the sharia before it enters into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the trash of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to foment a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," exclaims Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned," said Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would render it null and void.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the Muslim Brotherhood, well organized, called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of Cairo University.
The veiled women and the followers of the Salafists, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean up our country!" they asked Morsi, saying that "the Qur'an was their Constitution."
A fight for sovereignty over the symbolic place Tharir, where everything began, would soon have produced a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, this is what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that opponents of the draft Constitution, along with its supporters, had spoken loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot box what direction the country should take.
The Islamists' project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process, which should have lasted until February and encompass all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or before the courts under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights were indivisible.
That is why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets in his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to all three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant breaches of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto takes away all his powers," Saeda said.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could be paid for.
A protestant in Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway's rakfisk: is it the most fragrant fish in the world?
The five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to local appetite for an extremely fragrant fish?
Have some advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this odor, omnipresent, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a duration - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - that can go up to a year.
When darkness settles down and it's cold, Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," explains Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter also known as "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people eat small pieces of fish and put on a large amount of drink.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," Havard adds.
Drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it's not bad - it's like a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in airtight water barrels, then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, when well fermented, the fish came out and - no doubt with the senses diminished by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly to emigrate to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so much richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, though fragrant, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about her in international news, which is not to displease her.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about "the incident of July 22".
The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country one of them may have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has owed its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the unique reason for our success," explains Anna, our waitress, with her blonde hair and the eyes of a piercing blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a tray of rakfisk in her hand.
We are - how do you say - prudent people.
His English, like most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw money out of the window, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep its purse cords tight.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Not forgetting the rakfisk," she adds in a carefree laughter.
I stand under the snow and queue up to buy something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of elk, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I stay in is one of many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most fragrant of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a bow knot, surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
It's like the Eurovision contest.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"Here's our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of the fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC is interested in the challenges ahead and the many expectations of the people.
Road traffic in Mexico City is currently particularly poor.
In a city where traffic jams are frequent in normal times, a safety dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, thanks to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the US President, Mr. Pena Nieto was Governor of the State of Mexico.
A very densely populated and sprawling state that encircles the capital. On its land of choice, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic commune of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in everyone's memory.
The premises attribute to it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of crevices.
Plates bearing his name are hanging on the outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to make lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and the party of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economics in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
It rejects the critics of the opponents who accuse the new president of lacking charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobblestone streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more obvious.
Hidden under the autoponents of the highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called to the rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the past two years have been found on the edge of the dump.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place sadly famous for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's critics say that at best, he was unable to stem the problem of killing women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version refers to a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says the Señora Buendia.
There were signs that it had been beaten, and the cadaveric rigidity was already started.
As her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana dresses up the wall, next to a cross where the word: Justice appears.
However, this is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a whining woman.
They want us to accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it's not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new President has made the promise that he will make it his priority during his term of office.
"I hope he will be as good as he was when he was a governor," Olvera told Congressman Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, state the prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning allegedly suffered during detention.
The trial concerns Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to close the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping was carried out under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
On Friday, prosecutors tried to demonstrate that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of causing the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. Army -- missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claimed to have suffered during his military detention.
In cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein claimed that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a motion requiring that the Manning case be closed on the grounds that the kidnapping took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified that he wanted to commit suicide while in detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
During Friday's hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had filled out after meeting Manning, during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to maximum solitary confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment his guards had given him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had received in the prison was overall "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about certain problems orally and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the problems mentioned.
"They wrote "no problem" (after addressing the concerns), but that didn't mean I didn't raise any problems," Manning said.
Military judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
Members stated that they had assigned this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for its protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was fine, and I wanted to be removed from my status... so that I could enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison of the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he considered suicide while in Kuwait and fainted once because of the heat.
He added that not being kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to this cage in Camp Arafjon," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning stated that he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without a company.
Manning also added that the only items at his disposal were mattresses, blankets, flip-flops, clothing and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion because sleeping or lying down during the day was contrary to the rules.
Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned around at night, they woke him up so they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint about Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked overnight in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the appeal.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning stated that he had deduced from the order of his guard that he should release his blanket which might have hidden his nakedness, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to release it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the night before, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning allegedly told the officer that he could have used his underwear elastic or flip-flops to hurt himself, but that he had not done so.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he had during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence should he be convicted before a court martial, a trial that should be held early next year.
The defence has stated that Manning is considering pleading guilty to the least serious crimes and fighting for the abandonment of other charges deemed to be too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to national defence.
If all charges are brought against him, he is liable to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He said that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that Mexico-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
There were signs indicating two routes: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), and another for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I remained motionless for several seconds, not knowing which line to lead me.
I grew up in central California, where I've been called the "Mexican" my whole life.
This is an ethnic qualifier, just as my Boston friends use when they call themselves "Irish", or my New York friends when they call themselves "Italian".
Then I became Mexican-American.
But, here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth where my grandfather was born, there is no need for a special qualifier or a hyphen.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I don't have native vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed for the "Foreigners" line.
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their preferred themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are staying in Mexico rather than risking themselves in the United States.
He wants to join forces with the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory in writing at the tip of the gun.
But for Mexicans, who reflect in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans violate the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And Montezuma's kids are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want us to talk about bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer opportunities.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a relative or grandparents, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person was a typical person -- dark skin, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that this is the American dream we are living, and not the dream of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We give it to the United States.
Moreover, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they kill us as if we were inferior and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence means failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we wouldn't be stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexico Americans, because Mexicans claim their identity more firmly and Mexico Americans are upset.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels like she's part of two countries.
On the other hand, many Mexican-Americans I know don't feel like they're part of one country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And now, to further complicate the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexico Americans to work as makeshift ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the pervasive wage inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to take care of yourself, amigos.
That's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexico Americans still blame them for the way in which their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there never be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is in vain.
While the same futile arguments persist as to who started, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
The Arab Spring has shattered everything, and whether we like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Maybe their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet there is every reason to believe that this could help them to break this deadly impasse.
A war that doesn't make any losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Although the ceasefire on 21 November continues, this week's fighting has strengthened supporters of the force on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has been leading Gaza since 2007, will boast that they forced the Israelis to give up, even though Gaza has suffered a beating.
Having killed some of its leaders and returned the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza to one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the world, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might think that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a booming regional power, once the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has taken a stand for Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members jubilate and say that the Islamic crescent bends around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where Hezbollah's militia exercises domination, through Syria, where Islamist-led rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and up to Jordan, where Hamas' allies threaten the king.
And the most important, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populated and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are Hamas cousins, and their leaders rely more easily on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel's hard line will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put back in a box.
The Iron Dome missile interception system has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have criticized Hamas for being at the origin of the latest wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has prospered, notably under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although rocket fire from Gaza has killed approximately 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared suicide bombings, including through the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality under international law.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more belligerent party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the 22 January election, has the fair side.
Why are these damn Palestinians pampered by giving them a state?
If they were to run the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out with their heads.
Perhaps the hard-line supporters will win; but the Arab Spring may change the game.
Even if Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere have little appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to tackle problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to secure a ceasefire, which is a good omen -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel — much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by the reasonable people on both sides, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with an assignment of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will give outsiders an opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which now has to put an end to the circulation of weapons to Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal for a pseudo-state in the United Nations.
Obama also has an interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term of office, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back at the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packages have come into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law came into force in Australia as a world first, the logos and colors were replaced by a dark olive green and horrible photos of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small print on all packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to deter youth from smoking by removing glamorous portrayals.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start smoking.
"Even when children are very young, they understand the message of tobacco manufacturers through their branding," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has lobbied against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said this would boost the black market trade, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
"There will be adverse consequences from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
The counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask horrible packaging, has increased sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in the high court of Australia.
Ha stated that Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting renewal of stock.
For us, business is good.
The only problem, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the segment of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting TV ads, sports sponsorship and the requirement for dealers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and only have a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the absolute must," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some Lambda citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves whether this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has bothered to make a video, or is it a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry is focusing on the new regulations in place rather than marketing.
Industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries have told the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in 2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make warning photos on packages mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently under consideration in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and put the package away," said Victor El Hage as he bought a package with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna be arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in central Sydney, said the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on shelves.
"Before I needed an hour to unload a parcel, now I need four hours," Yu said.
"The government only had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's okay, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to be bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during Thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport to wait for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in child development praise boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to be bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, even to nourish creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll come back to it.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case," says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes back a long way," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, dating back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After going through many publications and submitting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as "an experience of wanting to do something, but without getting into a satisfactory activity."
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although he or she would like to do so.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of the boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a wretched mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
The boredom can look very much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while both can be related, bored people tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some bands heard, coming from the next room, the overly loud sound of a TV show that had no connection, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low noise level said that they were more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this concentration problem to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or challenging task, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "like looking at objects on a editing line, music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when you swirl or scribble, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to giggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay unmoved," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monocorde voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Scale of predisposition to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements like, "Among the tasks I perform, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and in particular need many and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blasé.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of adolescents reported bored at school and during homework at home, while 23 per cent reported bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 per cent of parents reported bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages of boredom today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: Is boredom good for you?
Sometimes no, because in its extreme form, this can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way the brain found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at the N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't get bored anymore, but he won't have learned to take care of himself or to self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant bubbling that generates activities and technology is the goal we should strive for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on that.
"We need to get bored more often, but boredom arouses an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it is difficult to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco stated that one day in September, he and a few friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons to appear for possession of drugs and materials that could be used for his use - minor offences, each with a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is it?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been closed.
The police have stopped charging adults aged 21 and over for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative ridings have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to charge those who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana shops in their neighbourhoods.
"Things are changing so fast that I don't know what the future holds for us," said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora's chief of police, east of Denver.
Washington state regulators are also asking a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidance on how to install a permit system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - by the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most states in terms of marijuana regulation, first of all regarding therapeutic use and now about personal use.
" Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Smith admits, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves," he said.
Washington's I-502 law comes into effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, in which the permit system will still not exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain: how to balance the mandate of the state that guarantees adequate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the establishment of cannabis sales shops within a 30 km radius around a school, park, playground or nursery.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up a licensed cannabis trade, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson for the recently formed cannabis legalization centre.
On 21 November, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City Attorney" (representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office) would no longer prosecute persons aged 21 and over who own small quantities of marijuana, and that the police should stop charging persons for this type of "immediate" crime.
Chief Oates stated that the police would implement the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, the "district attorney" Ken Buck embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, primarily in order to pressure users to be detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those people who committed an offence that, at the time of the offence, was a recognized offence," Buck said.
Reactions have been complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters have rejected the marijuana-restricted initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer summon adults for possession of limited quantities.
The representative of the County Public Prosecutor's Office, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss all marijuana detention cases.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time continuing to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and government framework for personal marijuana use is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different American cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with representatives of the Public Prosecutor's Office, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing people accused of marijuana use and speaking as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They spent much of their lives prosecuting people who used marijuana, so they find it hard to accept that it was legal," he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the verge of becoming a case law case for the legalization of drugs.
While defenders and government officials are anticipating a new legalized sales border, they are looking forward to the federal government's directives, which still conceives of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite some publicized arrests of patients on therapeutic marijuana and vendors, the federal government has primarily allowed medical marijuana businesses to practice in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police are not likely to break into doors to seize small drug bags, there is a strong bet that they are opposed to licensed personal-use marijuana sales businesses authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political advisor to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not waited for the federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments have approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana shops, even if it is only a one-year carry-over.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a six-month moratorium, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we face a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mistreated and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not only today's students who are being attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after moving to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack up, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were confused.
The L'Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson said with facetity that I had left after being forced to drink in chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I had been intimidated and subjected to constant bullying.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, not because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason only, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behaviour: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential counsel to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about it today, you'll tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of centre-right students suffer the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Student Hall (JCR) said they were "often isolated, attacked personally and felt undesirable" because of their political opinions.
They want a representative on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Wonderland: Young, Intelligent and Right"), devoted to student politics, which portrayed "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among them was student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who travels in Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit and moves with a chromed head rod.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper "that there is a growing left-wing bias in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who has proposed a motion for more protection, says that such a climate is "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, OUCA president, says that there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are centre-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one to think that way during my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and paralysing shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted against granting Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title because of the reduction in funding for graduate studies.
The atmosphere was filled with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students met the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen afterwards.
I discovered that teachers not only participated in sarcasm towards Tory students, but also took pleasure in them.
It was as if the policy on strike miners, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were engraved in the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm of which I was a victim concerned a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a small man with a pustular face, was easily carried away.
"Do Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears were burning my eyes.
"I suggest that you take French lessons during your free time - at last, if you're not too busy making friends," he said in a loud tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and felt a slight slap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student, named James, who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, nicely.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Any person suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most Tory youth claim to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything that Mrs Thatcher said.
This scheme has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political and economic science who ironically had studied in Eton said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
Other students have taken over the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I have only led a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who shared the same points of view only after dark?
Should I have become Labour and denied my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was thatcher's foreign policy advisor and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his adherence to the Marxist-Determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents' home in London, finding refuge with my more open-minded family and urban friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was unbelieving.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But this is the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreaming bell towers.
Even my communist friends had impeccable manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's for teasing you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a session of work conducted the following week, when another history professor suggested the most seriously in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Inwardly roaring with shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and called them "old fools."
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who pushed the last nail in my oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed up in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back there.
You can call me a whining chicken.
But no 18-year-olds should be subjected to such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Premiers Tory, but also has an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place of British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his sewing house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "he signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there are an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from the modest designer of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with kingship.
"At least they don't crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop music stars do," said Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of beauties of the past such as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentinian model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charisma of the couturier.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Plaza de España in Rome, we went to dinner at her apartment.
There were about 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
One could see and feel his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated", recalls the "top model", which started working with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He will never pass from fashion, because his creations are works of art," she concludes.
Nobility lineage parade
Garavani's life is not about obsessions but about shared love.
He likes the well-educated and with the greatest titles and they like him too.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre-wide podium that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to march on the podium to admire a dream "public" wearing Valentino's main creations, such as the tailor Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume Monica Vetti wore in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Among these models are names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria and Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of her clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember perfectly.
It consisted of trousers, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the couturier's muses.
"I prefer him over all the others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimes our beauty," adds the ex-duchess of Feria.
I very much like the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Nor can the princess and fashionist Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of being the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward of Line.
It was a red evening dress, with a flying skirt, a draped bustier and a cleavage to fall.
"It was a dream come true," said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the intemporel," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the evening dresses of the couturier with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also all the memories she carries".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the couturier thus calls his seamstresses) to make this dress in ivory silk with inlays of pearls, twelve different kinds of laces and a four and a half meters long trail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the haute couture of the end of the twentieth century, "the return of the clients of the high society".
Obnoxious for years by the "know-being" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani has as many honours as any spouse of her clients.
"His refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance have always jumped my eyes," admits d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If a princess says so...
The hardest job in the world: Kawah Ijen's human mule
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their life and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by carrying the sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulphuric gas emanating from the earth's entrails solidifies in contact with the air.
After collecting large sulphur rocks, which weigh a total of nearly 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 meters up to the summit of the volcano which peaks at 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a turtle's pace, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the volcano Kawah Ijen several years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 euro cents for each kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once at the top, he makes a path between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and painfully carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the scale that a mining company installed a little below at 1,850 meters of altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) per kilo of sulphur.
She then sells it to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) since this ore is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes him 3 hours and he finishes exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is three times what it would gain in the fields.
"The income of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)", says the bearer who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) a day and the job wasn't as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hinduists, and I brought her back to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and her eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life defying the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulfur has already begun to charge him the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and her eyes are irritated by toxic gases released by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work for another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in English more than acceptable.
Misled by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unhealthy wood massure with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur does not cease to spring at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater by lighting himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and does not provide equipment to self-employed carriers who are paid by weight.
Moreover, they also do not receive one sous of the 30,000 rupees (2,50 euros) of increase per camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (1,20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge to the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left college.
Able to carry up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which are obviously added their usual breathing problems, arthroses, pains in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometres away by a weed-infested goat trail.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says, opening her mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult trades in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah Ijen volcano.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame this lack of children for the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"Singapore's population must grow."
I'm a husband and a patriot, you're my wife and a patriot, let's fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem improbable that these words come from an advertisement for mint lozenges, but despite that, or perhaps because of that, the video spread like a dust trail on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a prank in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to ensure that people fulfill "their national duty."
It is intended only for the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt that it was a theme that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things, such as throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative but did not necessarily work.
So we said the following: what more creative to solve this problem than to make it a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singapore government is not taking it as lightly.
He spends US$1,300 a year on politics to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favour of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, increases maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, in line with its national population distribution, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
Why, then, do Singaporeans not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family building," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and to delays in marriage and birth, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound in barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially against Chinese who are accused of drawing wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's ruling party experienced its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to the developers, who were previously put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small housing units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new regulations may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by discussing with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre, it would appear that they are not going to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, which is why people postpone it," says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But for me, it is important to have my money and my time," another young man, about twenty years old, tells us.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons why they cannot have children.
Thus, while the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to baby-making, Singaporeans themselves have the final say.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for those under 16 years of age?
How can this definition be applied in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, between the ages of 10 and 15, who were frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level with "password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
"I won't reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I won't share one of my photos or someone who's making the fool," he says.
The boy acknowledges that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked people, crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge assures that he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are family members.
Her mother is one of them, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he adds.
"Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends, quickly," he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust someone who would recommend a stranger to him.
José's case, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter he admits not to know 20 of the people registered on his list of friends.
"It doesn't worry me because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one made any advances or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today under the name of cyber-harassment are no stranger to the young boy.
A relative of one of my friends was racked on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
The victim, according to José, didn't close his account.
"He only put it in a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or angry.
"Even though I know it's cyber-harassment," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to look for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras reports that academician Marc Prensky, who holds a Master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are they, children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves," she says.
He added that the theme was complex, "because we ask them to have a definite criterion on what should or should not be disclosed, published or said at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents about confidentiality is to use questions that make them think.
"Their saying not to do so is of no use," she says.
Then Porras lists some examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to publish a picture of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"Outside the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and education advisor, says it is essential that parents carefully read the conditions for using social networks.
By understanding each term, they will have a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to talk to foreigners.
The Unasur Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was announced earlier and theoretically adopted by the seven representatives present.
Efe has tried several times to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be disclosed after the closure of the summit, and then said that it would be published from one moment to the next on the website of the Peruvian government.
When questioned about the text, they reported that its contents had been explained by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The lack of information among journalists was reported by press officers of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more important information.
Later, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South America-Arab Summit (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although this was requested with the press, it had also not circulated the statement also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to set up safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited the gathering of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court which settles a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and stated that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleas of both sides in the Lima trial against Santiago which begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are bringing before this international court today," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of controversies, treaties and international tribunals," added President Piñera, giving a handshake to President Humala, next to the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia had denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua which it considered to be gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host President, Ollanta Humala, was instructed to open the deliberations in the morning and close the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been established between South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve access to medicines, access to low-cost Internet throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should help increase our productive matrix and see a better future for our people," President Humala concluded.
"We decided to favour a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a speech.
Of these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on its territory's transversal routes, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide further details.
Similarly, the outcome document referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and with good relations with its neighbours, is another theme discussed at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos, declared, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico to discuss calmly the maritime dispute through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to revise all these avenues, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua which will ask for a discussion with that country," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," added President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City where they plan to attend the takeover of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, in the framework of the summit, the Bloc Defence Ministers will meet in advance to endorse the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of Unasur, although it is suspended.
Peru assumed the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), in Lima, said on state television, TV Péru, that Europeans "had killed each other during the Second World War" and other conflicts, "but now they were almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the President of Ecuador expressed his support for the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the objective of diminishing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, but we, the South Americans, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding," he said, referring to Ecuador's political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not betray his principles, but instead respected his "profound democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish courts for requiring him to submit to an interrogation in his territory concerning an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish legislation allows him to do so by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's mental and physical health will deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"It acts on the health of anyone," he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the award of a safe-conduct to allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and points out that he had discussions in London to find a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not negotiating with human rights, we are not using that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of proceedings in various European bodies," he mentioned.
And he thinks that "if Britain were to grant safe conduct tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as its legislation quite permits, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate was "the mediocrity, bad faith and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil or perverse politicians but the bad journalists on account of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed the fact that this is not the kind of journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality, "this was destroying the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the President of Ecuador considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We must solve them as a whole in order to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the successful resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that it is "benefiting that Latin America will take up international proceedings if the two countries agree to accept a judgment however firm it may be".
Referring to the possibility of his nomination as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to running for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the primarys of February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this eventual victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I will withdraw from political life.
If we ever lose, I will, too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's health," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when he was confirmed with the HIV test.
"It was as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to inquire about him and his strenuousness was such that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there was a lot of doubt, little choice of treatment and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was speechless."
In those days, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same", said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes for reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
HIV/AIDS infectiologist and expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of immune system allocation that patients have at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reach a rate of 500 CD4.
To put it simply, it means that for someone who is diagnosed with HIV positive at age 25, "as long as he remains under control, he can live without problems up to age 75," explained the interviewed scientist.
In order to put this progress in context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years on average.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died as a result of AIDS has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of UNAIDS), it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients registered on the national data basis have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
Then why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the last 12 years at least, we have never lacked medication, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact that "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to carry out earlier diagnoses and, to do so, we must offer screening tests on a massive scale, to all those who ask for it".
Specialists and members of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida) agree with his proposal, as do patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and because, despite his young age, he was already carrying AIDS and suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better if I have fun three times a week," they say.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he is suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of World AIDS Day.
If they've taken risks, the sooner they'll know if they're HIV positive, the better, and if they're already diagnosed, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programmes and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the greatest is prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "the distribution of condoms has actually been increased, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, it is very good, but it results, that still today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers don't want to hear, says the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold at counters, but be found in public toilet dispensers and in places frequented by young people.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied when asked whether there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, the best is to provide condoms to people already sexually active," he stressed.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is the fourth largest state in the country in terms of the number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th largest in terms of the number of people living with HIV.
92% of infections occur by sex, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for every registered case, there are 4 or 5 people who do not know.
A judgment ratified on appeal by a US court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario sets a bad precedent for all national companies with branches in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
It therefore seems that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican law are not valid in the country with the starry banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgement handed down on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenceless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's leading glass manufacturer to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the trial judge notes that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, states that the main proceeding is formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
Indeed, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been created for that purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the intercorporate vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro's subsidiaries towards the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
Here there are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in any case the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the courts of the United States, i.e. the "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained a majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A data omitted by the appellate court.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has encountered since 2008 without stopping at the serious economic crisis facing the United States, passing on the costs to the country.
For the time being, the González Sada family society will appeal to the same court of appeal so that the vote can take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance remedy will demand non-prosperity and requires review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") in which Vitro's procedure under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act was detailed, noting that this freed him from the agreements signed by both countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he noted that the country had adhered to the United Nations Commission on International Trade principles, i.e., the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensured fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they stomp Vitro and they stomp the country.
General review
The complaints of the unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the former boss of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were ignored for several months, the latter was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviateurs has already encountered problems.
The body, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just submitted a criminal application against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the F/589 trust of bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used to purchase shares of the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're besieging the Dragon Mart.
A group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society, gathered at the end of the week in an amphitheatre at the University of the Caribbean, and approved the creation of a broad opposition front to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the South-East zone in order to oppose the monumental project which is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to the industry.
ACTA's dead.
The government put forward a requirement of the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under its acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already of ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was well done that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term homex

Birth of Competival
Integrated by NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, IT leaders, a new consortium with Competival as its corporate name has just emerged, whose objective will be the market for clustering software services in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
The globetrotter of basketball "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, travelled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as great as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage condemned him to wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for over 60 years, whether as a lower league player, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I have worn several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his unusual itinerary, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loved most were those who reminded him of his career as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
"It was my best years, the ones I took the most advantage of because I had the chance to compete in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or manager.
It's been a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a strong player for you, he's two meters tall.
Do you want it?"
That's how to start Mincy, one of Puerto Rico's best players.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win one championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He was delighted with the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only remotely since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's positions on the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived in fourth place and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn't had us play the last game again," said Reyes.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as was the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was that of the 1991 Cuban Pan American Games, when we won the gold and we beat the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the suspended players with the improglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all the predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Undoubtedly, it is Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level like Piculín did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that by the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What is left for you to do?
There are things I would have liked to put in place, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys play only in their area and play only teams from other parts of the island during national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when this is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for managers, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide by the leading role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied an unscrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of complications of cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in her dear hometown of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved the most," said the family.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who interpreted his wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived his life to the full," Gray said in a statement.
The doctors had diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he had admitted that he had been drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignancy in the liver and had been transplanted.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television in the role of an ordinary type in the series "Jinny de mes rêves" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also appeared in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among her roles in the cinema are well received roles by critics in "Le bande", "Harry et Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and their relatives was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated speculation all over the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave town, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) interned.
"I know what it would take to epitaph J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "Ci-gite the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-prototheist of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as a man " immense, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us, who have had the chance to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the channel TNT.
The recording of five episodes is already finished for the second season and a sixth is in progress, informed the channel.
For the time being, neither Warner nor TNT have communicated on how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who has known fame with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she was born in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps in New York theatres in the early 1950s and served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': Les mémoires mercières de J.R)
"I haven't written anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect them in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donor and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist concerned patients.
"I advise them, I give them back confidence, I come with them when they come for surgery and then," he says in 1996.
I'm trying to give them some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a while, but it's gonna be okay."
He has also been an anti-tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course on the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a lecture on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching there an irresistible hook: the end of the "big count" of the Maya calendar, on December 21, to which many people refer as proof of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what was waiting for him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal abyss that some dubbed "the Armageddon of debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end times thought the apocalypse would trigger.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," said Professor Charmé to his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, it was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is evil is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he's not the only teacher to lecture on "the end of the world" this semester, which will be, in theory, the last in history.
In Temple, assistant professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real life examples.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply entitled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world does not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students have to study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the very night of the end of the supposed world," said Restall.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," said Restall about his course for high-level students, made up of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the semester began, from people who asked if there was still room.
The students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people can do to comfort themselves," says 23-year-old religious and sociology student Bridgid Robinson from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of Revelation, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Infirmary, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a professor, told us that they believed the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it," says Julie zegle, a 21-year-old Temple student from West Chester.
The Mayas have never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I concede that there is an anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back several centuries, that makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to a rise in speculation.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it," he says.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that classes were being given here on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years we have talked about the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or thinking about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many have told us that they are thinking of going to "end of the world" parties.
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh at them together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
