Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria resulted in a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current grand coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly large losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthie Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the vote, the country's first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 per cent of the vote.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent loses almost nine percent of the votes, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major parties in the post-war period; especially for the popular party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Still early in July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable lead over the SPÖ.
However, the voters visibly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations about the possible resignation of the party leader and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were pronounced.
The observers believe that this could happen on Monday, during the extraordinary party leadership council.
Such a move would a priori facilitate the way towards the outcome of the election, which remains the most likely outcome, namely the renewal of the great SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
Nevertheless, in view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 per cent and BZÖ 11 per cent of the votes - the Socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repeat of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ separated from it) on a common government, which was even subject to sanctions by the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he plans to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently relies on this development.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell back, among the Austrian political parties, from the third in fifth position.
Obviously, no other party crossed the four per cent limit and did not join parliament.
Schwarzenberg: India's relationship may get colder
If the problem of Czech researchers accused of illegal cockroaches in India could not be resolved, then, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, some cooling of Czech-Indian relations would ensue.
The minister said it today in New York, after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, some cooling would happen," he observed after the meeting, following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, on leaving the talks, that it was difficult for the executive branch to intervene in judicial matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was discharged from the charge and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling government, the case being under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could ask for bail and wait for the trial at large, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner spoke in the same direction also during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide convicts with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them by India.
"We want above all to keep the best relations with India, which have a tradition that continues over many years.
The Indians also recognized him," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We regard the imprisonment and accusation of these Czech researchers as a great misunderstanding," he said.
The minister avoided the question if he had obtained a promise from India to deal with the matter.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he said only.
A Czech arbiter the fight for the sea floor
It is approaching an electronic wall map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
Now, he is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent sea floor.
However, this area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of thirty members of the United Nations division for ocean affairs and the law of the sea.
Its head, the division's director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
Ardent work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little-known world, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found here, but also unknown living organisms, which may contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A larger background than the land
The littoral states have now begun to vehemently aspire to the new underwater territories.
According to a UN convention, they use their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of so-called continental self, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
According to the Convention, the latter may claim exclusively all the resources of the continental self.
"To simplify, the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea, is considered to be continental.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the 200 nautical miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic yone," explains Mikulka.
The request that the country in question makes to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many costly prospecting and methrise.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and scientific and technical assistance.
So far, the Commission has dealt with five requests: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the time being, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," adds Mikulka.
Australia's success, which was the first to significantly expand its underwater possessions, has recently had a global impact.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory — the extent of the seabed, which was allocated to it by the commission last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometres, which represents the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in exploration.
The benefits they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they project themselves, be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, submit their requests.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental self ends, begins the zone of the ocean floor, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There is no longer an exclusive position in any state.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"Nevertheless, let's not be mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," says Director Mikulka, exaggerating that "its areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Some of the seabed is also now owned by the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states in the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
The Commission obtained in 1991 under the Convention, together with investors from a few other states, the status of the so-called "pioneering investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is turbulent, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract on an expanse with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, gives an example of such a concretion.
It recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical Shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The German special forces were there for the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready but never took action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted from Egypt are revealed.
According to information from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
Thus, both federal army specialists and GSG 9, Federal Police Air Flight and Federal Criminal Police Office officials, as well as logistics experts from Technischen Hilfwerk, were at the scene of the liberation.
As the Ministry spokesman communicated on Monday evening, German forces were finally not required, as the hostage-takers released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government reportedly accepted Germany's assistance to integrate it locally as a support force.
"Happily this has not happened so far," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers abducted in southern Egypt the group of tourists made up of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
Following their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were trans-battled in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers has so far remained vague, as have details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have since arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the hostages released were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the time being, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five vacationers and the special forces should have taken off on board an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
United States House of Representatives Refuses Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the US Congress just failed the $700 billion bailout plan.
The Dow Jones was sinking into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the US House of Representatives rejected the bailout plan for the government's financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of US President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was to stem the chaos of the financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic move, the parties had desperately tried to convince opponents of the validity of this $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democrat representatives during the debates, had called for a vote in favour, although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he conceded.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones dropped by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state rescue plan could overturn.
He went up shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of failure, fell again.
Experts are now planning further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to come into effect, the approval of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate is necessary.
Organizers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months, according to one study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the thirst for German travel remains insatiable according to this study.
With regard to bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) entrusted to Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute, growing numbers of bookings are already dominating the fall months.
As a result, sales would have increased to about 11 per cent compared to 2007, according to the RVD.
The sources of these results are the figures from the GfK, which analyses monthly booking data from 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the overall market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low price of the dollar, travel to the US would be particularly requested, said the RVD.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about a Third Party.
Next to that, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be particularly sought after by the Germans.
Tour packages in particular are very popular, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising energy and food prices, the costs here would be "more easily calculable for the customer than for an individual tour".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with early booking discounts or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very much retained so that an increase in sales figures will again be recorded compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at Beer Day
Ballermann or Apres-Ski hits continuously, beer in pitchers per litre and celebrities in Tyrolean designer costumes.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't actually have much in common.
She is blonde, television host and wears a tailor-made Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves at us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and that on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean suit seems to be reaching its goal.
As a beer party tourist and normally living north of the Weißwurst Equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once in Place Thérèse, everything is half the worse.
Everyone or almost everyone wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; no one seems blasé or ashamed - it's completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean costume collects a few odd eye strokes at the banana-shock stand.
A Bavarian woman points out to me that I would have wrongly tied my apron: "left means free, in the middle virgin, right squared, back widow."
Discreetly, I'm tripping my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she said and laughed.
Others don't go to so much trouble with these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which is written "Too drunk to get trained!" and exposes their naked hindquarters to us without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, arrives from England and comes for the first time to the beer festival.
He thinks it's "gorgy," with a "ooooo" lying down.
He's telling me all this after he'd been relieved by the catch he'd been drinking before.
Right next to that fire hydrant that everyone thinks is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild pissers."
Others don't have the chance to get rid of alcohol that way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, a bunch of rescuers run into the festive square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Instead, the nurses take part in a pack - always by four, dragging their stretcher covered with tents in tents.
It works this way for most visitors of the beer festival: we go empty, we come back full of it.
Those who lie in the casket of the drunks under the tarpaulin are not visible.
"These are the ones who can no longer swallow anything," shouts one of the rescuers in answer to my question and then disappears into the mix.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in Friday afternoon's accident in town on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to the Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He's been released ever since, on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its hinterland.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps from Asia, is one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
That's at least what the guides tell us.
The monument is placed on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation towers at each of its corners, like some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, retarded to the game of imperialism, wanted to achieve its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as the land more known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of his area in the vicinity, generated by the cold war's icy borders, is over.
. The British and Empire forces advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources claim that this is sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, swallowed up in the meanderings of history.
But today, the railway crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, serves - at least symbolically, to highlight the enlargement of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its region in the vicinity, generated by the cold war's icy borders
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a sleeping car towards the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit MP AKP Turkish Suât Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a journey of 10 1/2 hours, shaken on noisy tracks whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital- presented as a new city of a new age-old state, turning my back on its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots is an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra modern structure, expressly built of stones and steel, in a developing area, surrounded by half built shopping centers and by numerous pastries in which middle managers in suit-work-men and women- meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"the aim of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey now into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for both.
She had to do both.
"But now, at some point, "I asked if" Turkey should not choose?".
"Turkey" he said "does not want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out an aspect that almost all those with whom I could speak, recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway goes not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, it is therefore, as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe metaphorically traveling on the tracks to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleeping, I rethought these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in Turkey's hands.
As I waited at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been named "the sick of Europe".
At least there is no longer any doubt on the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Musical director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (deceased September 11) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir had to include the under-21s, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years old refused to abandon the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any type of music, whether Madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there, in the music.
So sing!"
His baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be named a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982 when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them ever disappointed me-- and, sometimes, they even inspired me
Tod Handley had such a rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, "focus only on certain people".
A lot of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (died 25 September) states that "in 1946 he had returned to his studies in economic history at Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was doing a BSc, an MA, and a PhD."
That's what came from Woodruff's letter in Beyond Nab End, but that's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco and Life" because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have drawn attention to me because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second assault for Honda's super sales
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
Although its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
Added to this are some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
So it's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz has a very similar line to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before looking at the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation comes on the market.
First of all, Honda has renovated this model in a shorter time frame than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most widely traded car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it expects to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8.000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The managers of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely offset the decline in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand hopes to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 fewer cars than in 2007, a decrease in sales of 16%.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Based on markets and according to estimates by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight's sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is planned for the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change or 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and the interior space also.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a reserve of gasoline in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the trunk capacity - which has a double bottom system - can hold up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity than the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to exterior elements such as rear lights or panoramic roof - is improved access to rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, relative to the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2- and 1.4-litre gasoline thrusters.
Both engines have i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine develops 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4.900 rpm.
This thruster - which on the previous Jazz was 78 horsepower - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous thruster, which on the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now reaches 100 horsepower.
This 100 horsepower Honda Jazz 1.4L has a combined fuel consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired this time by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company created a robot that, by imitating the theft of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Centre have made this little robot in collaboration with the Centre for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Trademark Management, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan security shield.
This robot will allow the brand's vehicles to prevent collisions.
During flight, each bee creates its own personal space with an oval shape that looks much like the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the bee's eyes, able to see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is known as a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles over a distance of two metres and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"When it detects an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bifurcating its wheels by 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape manoeuvre is totally instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Transportation Laboratory and the main engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards, nor diagonally; it can move only in two dimensions and according to what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, but also an acceleration and deceleration function, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
" Each second this device must only process information and act according to that data.
It does not need to keep the information or intuitive logics of prior maneuvers, which is why it can operate continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes."
This is the first car to develop new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced into standard cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They're afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be acknowledged that the Treasury of the United States, besides having a lot of cash to make plans, is not devoid of geniuses.
Faced with the crisis, and in order to avoid Americans embarking on mortgages with credit banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is to say, 'the Hotel of bad credit' ... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Master of Hotel leads us to think several times if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it.
It is sure that this game gives useful information but little detail.
It's more of a teen-only game.
¿What if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, will be joining in its turn to pay $9 billion to take 21% of its capital, a news received by a sharp drop in its stock exchange price.
A week after announcing a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would purchase 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at a unit price of $25.25, for a total of $3 billion.
The price chosen is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley indicated that the overall transaction would be conducted on the basis of an average unit price of $29, or 28% above its current price.
The Morgan Stanley action, however, lost 6.79% to $23.07 around 5:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," said John Mack, CEO of the US group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which is intended to allow him to diversify his activities but makes it come under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to take a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been modified in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for about 8.5 billion dollars.
"A week ago," Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, told Tokyo, "we thought the stake would be entirely composed of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement previews that MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into common shares if the latter exchange more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at about 47 dollars, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
However, a spokesperson for the group refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he had "clearly" lightened his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, which has seen its stock exchange price melt in half while the cost of insurance against default risk on its debt is flying away.
This cost fluctuated on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refounding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, he was the third to put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the exit of the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a large victory of the "yes", between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed in the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly," he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by her Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place in a calm atmosphere according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), focused on a 444-point text consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the State over the economy, reserving to it the "planning of the development" of a country living essentially from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign currency sent by its emigrants.
Ported by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants enhanced powers to the Head of State, who can carry out up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services which the President has begun to establish in that country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando attacked the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back this Monday afternoon safe and sound in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived at about 3.30 p.m. aboard a special plane at al-Maza military base, next to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, aboard helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examination.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers," said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the tarmac.
Captured on 19 September during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been swept from one cache to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organiser of the safari.
An Egyptian security official reported that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of shots occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled," said the official who requested anonymity.
He reported that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the flash unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men in the secret services and special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The previous day, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle carrying the kidnappers, killing in six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and occupying this election campaign.
Good.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the amount of misery that is being given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are starving?
What politician dares to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to the restoration of the only Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, elected officials and government departments, in concert.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with excavating history, preserving with three under heaps of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
It is they, often, who are the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When is a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Holland bank, as the first European bank in distress as a result of the snowball effect of the US credit market crisis, by partly nationalising it. The three countries are bearing, to the sum of 11.2 billion euros, this financial and insurance institution also owns interest in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also appealing to the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been growing for more than a year is for Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy back nearly half (up to 49%) of the bank's capital in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell part of its holdings, among which, in the first place, the mainly insurance activities it acquired last year from the Dutch organisation ABN Amro.
Last week, the Fortis shares started a staggering fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too large to be allowed to go bankrupt.
On Friday alone, the company's shares fell by 12 percent, to reach its lowest level of 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the present value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company's management, is not realistic.
The company's management is aware of the uncertainty, in connection with the adoption of the $700 billion US rescue plan, that it was responsible for the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new Managing Director.
The financial agency was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a substantive proposal.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's customer circle and no agency was stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also bought leasing companies.
A fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate based on information about his or her drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes which link the use of information on the prescription of medicinal products, in all cases, to the consent of the data subject.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it's like entrusting his hen house to a fox" - recalled Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage medication prescriptions, at the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the capital insured in case of damage depend on the state of health of the client who presents himself, and if they consider that the risk is too great, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent the candidates for a medical examination, and they did not sign an insurance contract with them until they had read the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he easily obtains data from pharmacies on the person's medication purchases in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, what disease the person suffers and what is his or her state of health.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts it in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is no longer much to do with the insurer except the paperwork. However, tiny problems may still arise.
One of the disadvantages of this program is that a drug can be used for a variety of purposes. For example, some mixtures may be used against migraine or hot flashes, but may also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of the data and they must ask the patient for authorisation before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their failings in the past.
Recently, some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory analyses and linking them with data on drug use, and in this way they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of use is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the extension of the control circle of the authorities concerning companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his programme, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the data subject.
It is also a question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her consent or not, since if he or she refuses, the insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
Thus and ultimately, hens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other, largely global, problems.
Today, a France-India summit will also be held, focusing on cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is a great emerging democratic power that should be given a wider voice in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to agree on their support in New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not dwell too much on this issue yesterday at the 9th summit held in Marseilles.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, like the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would double trade, which means an increase of a hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an overly ambitious objective.
In this sense, they have harmonized legally the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights, and in this way air exchanges will also be able to grow in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, the EU's largest trading partner, on the one hand, and New Delhi, on the other, which is only ranked ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on the subject was raised.
The completion of the Doha trade round has also been called for, although both have much to do with the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains committed to the energy and climate agenda, in particular that it would like to reduce its emissions of toxic materials by at least 20 per cent until 2020.
India also agreed on this, as well as with the fact that a global market would have to be reached at the climate conference next year, and greenhouse gas emissions would have to be reduced by fifty per cent until 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of State is now visiting the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the news agency's information, the agreement would cover 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits for this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171.790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles in exhibition, and Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: indeed, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a press meeting in Room Struktur, at butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign-authored books is gradually decreasing in relation to the total Italian production, and in particular, in relation to that for adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire missing a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying on the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3000 metres, in the area of the Sierra Nevada of Mammanth Lakes, on the California- Nevada border.
Inside the plane, no human remains however.
The sheriff from Madera County, John Anderson, overcame the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it is the one Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found either on the aircraft or in the vicinity.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Board (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreckage was located, a team of investigators dispatched to the scene identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on 3 September 2007, when Fosset decoupled from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal belongings were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing the name Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash species and a sweater.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
By the sixth attempt, he had become in 2002 the first man to complete the round the world round on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had travelled around the world by plane and without stopover.
Among all these records, also that of flying at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a co-driver.
Glk, the ad you're not expecting.
A 4x4 out of the ordinary of an original and well defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
This is, in summary, Glk, the latest born off road "compact" of the house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
Precisely because of its out-of-standard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showroom, from next October 17th.
Thus the advertising threshing that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented communication modality, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, one will have the impression that by looking at the image, the auto comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertisement, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of motorist communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future acquirers? We will see.
These are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italy" which has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created any big problems.
Nor had ever clashed with the opposing tifosi.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (rather in reality) from Campania and Puglia were added.
They had three-coloured flags on which their home town appeared: Saturday night, they were all removed for not being identified.
They are inspired by English tifosis.
In Bulgaria, they found a tifosis of real Nazists, that of Levski.
The Ficc had made available Italian tifosi, 144 tickets for the part: all nominatives, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had indeed controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian tifosi who had a history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal waits to read the acts that will arrive from the Bulgarian police, and then will take measures: in this case, it is possible that the tifosi arrested or identified in the disorders will purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that forbids to attend Italian stadiums, but also European ones.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot in the stadium.
Fortunately.
But now it is time for fear-emulation: that is to say, others risk being added to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must put an end to this fire immediately, and not legitimize that behaviour," says the Viminal.
So, "keep your eyes open especially in view of Wednesday's National Team game in Lecce"
In Puglia there is indeed a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets on Tuesday the Casms, which can even count on a section of the Aise, i.e. the secret services, which are dealing precisely with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched out during Mameli's hymn ? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently, director of the Observatory of the Viminal (he took the position of Francesco Tagliant and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste where resides a core of supporters of the group Ultras Italy, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 tifosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the first of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the Country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group has remained in the rules, now we will see what has happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles to Mameli's hymn: these too are not crimes, but if you will allow me, they are not polite..."
