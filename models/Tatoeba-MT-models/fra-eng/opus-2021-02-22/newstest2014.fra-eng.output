Spectacular "wingsuit" jump over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped Thursday from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination with wings), it passed 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate shrine, located at more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many bad guys had gathered to observe its feat.
A black box in your car?
While planners in the U.S. road network are struggling to find the money to repair the deprecated highway infrastructure, many are looking for a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches itself to the dashboard of your car.
The aircraft, which record all the miles travelled by a motorist and transmit the information to the officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in the planning government offices to redesign the obsolete system of financing the main American roads.
The generally uninteresting sector of major axis planning suddenly led to a lively debate and heated alliances.
The libertarians have joined environmental groups to lobby for the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly the road you travel, and then use the information to draft a tax law.
The Tea Party is shocked.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress are unable to agree whether to continue, several states have not waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles travelled.
Thousands of motorists have already embarked these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental trip.
This is truly indispensable for our nation.
"It's not like we have a choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, who predicts that the state will begin recording the miles travelled by each Californian motorist by 2025.
There's going to be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes that the Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars can travel more than miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed trackers on 500 cars to test a payment system per mile.
"It turns out to be the most logical long-term alternative," he said.
Wonks calls this a mileage user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces urban liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state's ambitious laws on global warming.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chair of the Transport Committee of the House of Representatives, said he also considered it the most viable long-term alternative.
Supporters of the Reason Foundation's free market also appreciate the idea of charging drivers per mile.
"It's not just a tax coming into a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President of Policy at Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they receive.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transport Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to move towards payment per mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved approximately 10,000 cars.
But the Speaker of the House killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to their work or to the city.
Nevertheless, several States and major cities are making progress.
The most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the country's largest experience.
These motorists will soon pay the Crown kilometric fees instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering one.
Illinois is testing a limited number of trucks.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the U.S. east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with an aircraft, drivers were worried that the government could follow their every move.
"Anxiety about Big Brother and this kind of thing is a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads the strategic performance management in Nevada's Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
At the beginning of the trial, the Nevada ACLU warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged location devices."
It is not necessary to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily goings and goings.
Nevada is one of the few states that are now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
Researching this technology has led some state agencies to use a small California startup named True Mileage.
Initially, the company was not intended to assist motorists who pay taxes to the states.
It sought to break into the emerging auto insurance market, where drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices that it tests have pleased the planners of the major axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't record their speed and locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Big mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much cheaper ways and far less intrusive methods of doing so.
In Oregon, planners try the experiment by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all state residents.
Other states hope to sell the concept to distrustful citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transport officials are looking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide "driving payment" insurance and create a real-time speed data set from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Car drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them," said a document on urban development.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the whole debate on the payment per mile is simply a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing gas taxes.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid drivers and others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgery when you simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, Director of Legislation and Public Affairs at the Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four New Listening
The English musician hasn't finished surprising this year.
Starting with The Next Day, released in January, it concocted a luxury re-release scheduled for November 4, with several new releases.
Four have already emerged on the Web.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone panicky.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he declared that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dates from 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be counted on to sparkle the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one ride in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke has planned to reissue this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
He introduces both each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pouches, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics...
And, above all, he gives a taste of his new Atomica title, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and skilfully controlled rock electricity.
New ones already on the list
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the Web.
The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a light cavalcade that gradually slows down to give way to a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John's Rocket Man or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would it come from another planet?
Guitar riffs, bewitching, make you want to leave Earth.
Bowie is in any case having fun playing chameleon with these titles: informer turn, man aboard a rocket, Martian potential...
He hides and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
It is no wonder that he has a mask in his hand in the photograph of the L'Invitation au Voyage campaign, by Louis Vuitton, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that injured soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was being followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured members - who do not meet the "universal service" rule of the army requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for pension benefits.
They cited two cases reported by La Presse Canadienne, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, was released from the military despite his request to remain for another year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case followed that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who stated before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before being ready because he did not meet the universality of service rule.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that it was totally different than wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with La Presse Canadienne on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has struggled to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks, but who are not fit for combat.
Under the current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicate that of the 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required length of service to obtain pension benefits.
The Liberal veteran spokesman, Jim Karygiannis, on Wednesday called for the reinstatement of Corporal Hawkins, while NDP Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice."
Disney bets on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to focus on tablets on its own television channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its mobile and tablet app.
Its global launch on Disney's channels is not expected until 2014, details the press release of its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, intended for children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of the pussy Callie, sheriff of a city in the American west where she makes order with a magic lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, Vice President for Digital Products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the press release.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the life of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms," he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 years of age have already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of children under 8 years of age, compared to 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence whistleblower, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he enjoys the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter that the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts was obviously positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a flight and seeks to penalise political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is charged with espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told the Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will make this possible."
Relations between the United States and Germany have been put to a severe test by complaints that the NSA had tapped the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States", it should be taken advantage of.
Mr Ströbele, German Green MEP, posted a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele stated that, according to the lawyer for the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be "safe" there, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "serious and sustained" campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global response to “my act of political expression”.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials – including in the United States – have found the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance to be of public benefit.
The letter puts forward an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately Netflix video-on-demand service via their television in a future that does not seem so distant.
The Cogeco subsidiary said on Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to highlight more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options," explained Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet in an interview.
Cogeco Cable is thus following in the footsteps of its competitors, such as Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary does not yet have a specific date for this new platform.
"We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our clients currently do not have access to.
The telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, could be resolved.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in discussions with some major cable companies to make its service available through their broadcast platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper Government in its Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the option of paying for pay-per-view services.
"It's been about two and a half years since we said that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large chain packages doesn't work," said Audet.
He hoped, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would lead to interesting recommendations.
"A new kind of framework will have to emerge from these discussions to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television," said Cogeco's CEO.
The CRTC has been consulting with the public since last week and is expected to continue with the industry next spring.
In terms of results, Cogeco reported a net profit of $43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¢ per share.
This is a decrease from net earnings of $44.9 million, or 83¢ per share, for the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline through depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired the US-based Atlantic Broadband cable company for $1.36 billion in 2012.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal-based company also purchased Peer 1 Network Entreprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for $526 million.
As for Cogeco's revenues, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are $1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, in the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable's revenues increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, in fiscal 2013, Cogeco Cable's number of customers increased 5,546.
Mr. Audet is not worried that the number of clients will fluctuate in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from one quarter to the next with very strong competition.
Horse in beef products
Horse meat was detected in canned beef products, sold by two small UK retail outlets at low prices, today announced the agency responsible for food hygiene.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA at a height of 1 to 5%.
"Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," explained the UK agency.
A scandal about the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to reviews by the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles resulted in four injuries, early Friday, on Highway 131, in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a motorist driving in a northerly direction at Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and struck a car coming in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic had returned to normal around 6:00 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers carrying carry-on baggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for carry-on baggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them as the aircraft descends.
New hand luggage charges apply to bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free of charge.
Frontier stated that it would charge $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if the travellers only paid once at the gate.
Frontier's spokesperson, Kate O'Malley, indicated that the $100 was intended to encourage travellers to pay the fees in advance.
"We don't want to make this price pay," she explained.
The airlines started charging for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid this expense put as much as they could in the carry-on baggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no room in those compartments.
These fees are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said these new fees will not really be used to raise money.
The aim is to make the most loyal Frontier customers understand that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase their tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
For example, a passenger queued at a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue could have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and check-in procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these fees before arriving at the door.
Frontier's hand baggage charges will not be applied until the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often frown about baggage and other expenses, but airlines love them.
They consider that baggage handling costs are significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street view the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines charge enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, many of them did not cover the cost of baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first carry-on baggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant company followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant to airlines Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the surcharges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's carry-on baggage costs were $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former manager of Midwest Airlines, recently travelled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate as passengers discovered the company's unusual hand baggage charges.
"I've never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire professional career," he said.
I expected to see teeth gnashing and a fight breaking out at the door.
The aircraft was full, he added, "the passengers boarded at the speed of lightning."
Frontier also makes like Spirit and charges a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who take coffee can be served free of charge.
It will always distribute water free of charge.
US Airways briefly attempted to charge for drinks in 2008 but went back seven months after the passengers complained and while no other major airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to charge for carry-on baggage when passengers do not purchase their tickets directly from the airline is its last effort to encourage customers to visit its site.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of going to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began to offer only half a mile of loyalty to customers who purchased their tickets via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she reduced mile bonuses by 25% on a trip.
For example, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would save 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in its home town, Denver, but its business is shrinking and it is losing money.
Revenues dropped by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to correct Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
NSA calls into question an "internal error" and not hackers for the breakdown of its site
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said on Friday that it was a bug that caused the breakdown of its public website for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the breakdown was due to a distributed denial of service attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson explained.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the breakdown of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactics is not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The NSA, once known as the "No Such Agency", has come under the spotlight and has been heavily criticized in recent months as a result of a wave of revelations about its extensive national and international communications monitoring programs – which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by NSA's former disillusioned consultant, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has led to many speculations that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
Delta Downtown now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta promises not to let down its employees.
Employers came to meet with employees directly on site, employees were met individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains Delta Hotels Regional Director of Labour Relations, Félix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta is taking place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Either he was reinvesting in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, Chair of Transat Tourism at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for seniors.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totalling nearly 600 rooms will be created within two years.
For Titan's CEO, "Goodyear Amiens' buying project starts with zero employees"
After tossing the towel in January for the partial takeover of Amiens-Nord's Goodyear site promised at the closure, Maurice Taylor, CEO of the American tyre manufacturer Titan, says today, ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the plant has.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister for Productive Recovery, had already announced this on Monday 21 October.
After giving up the plan to buy the plant in January, you come back today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "mad" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand that volte-face.
Is it to please Mr Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr Montebourg, is a charming young man who is trying to save some of the best paid industrial jobs.
If I hurt someone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries we work eight hours handicaps France.
In India, China and many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has space to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But with a fair price and skilled workers, it's worth a try.
What kind of deal do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the plant's closure, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance pay, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys Goodyear's closed plant.
As a result, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
But he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from among the approximately 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before he tries to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on severance benefits for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister was 333.
I know he'd like a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance benefits.
If all employees accept them, the plant's purchase plan starts with zero employees.
How can we give guarantees of duration of employment when there are no more employees left on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg succeeds in reaching agreement between the CGT and Goodyear and Titan buys the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier's profit declines, while aircraft deliveries and orders decline
Bombardier Inc., a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in net earnings on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and deliveries of aircraft during the third quarter and from contract problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide in-flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial commissioning schedule by September.
After the pilot's inaugural flight about a month and a half ago, the pilot flew only three times, and the question then arose as to whether the test phase was on track.
The results were not up to expectations and the share price fell by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating Thursday from "overperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential for the stock exchange to increase in the next quarter or two.
"Although the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division," Cameron Doerksen said in a customer note.
We expect Bombardier to record new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew away for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is so far modest to 177. Potential buyers appear to be waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's assertions about the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airliner.
Currently, the company has registered a total of 403 purchase orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders prior to the commercial launch of the first aircraft.
Leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was progressing according to schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground any longer than expected," said Mr. Beaudoin at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft's downtime.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to make a first flight and provide for an update period, and that's what we did.
This will happen again throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly away in the coming weeks, while the others will follow shortly thereafter, the company said.
Yet analysts are skeptical that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that it was in the process of assessing the time frame for entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
"This slowness in flight testing – although apparently consistent with Bombardier's internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be delayed in the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net income dropped to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues decreased slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a result of 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world reported that it had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared to 57 a year earlier.
Net controls have fallen to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aerospace division was $32.9 billion at September 30, a figure unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
"In Aerospace, the results were in line with our forecast, but the low number of orders and overall market conditions were disappointing," said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aerospace revenues fell by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the largest rail manufacturer in the world, said that its revenues had increased by almost 11% to $2.1 billion.
The Transport division's order backlog totalled $32.6 billion as at September 30, a slight increase from December 31 of the previous year.
The Transport division's margins have been adversely affected by enforcement problems with some large contracts.
Leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's share price, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer of Google Inc., would sit on the Board of Directors, dropped from 8.5% to C$4.83 in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third-largest aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, reported on Thursday a 10% decline in its quarterly earnings.
Two speleologists aged 23 and 27 had been missing in a chasm under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday evening, it was learned Friday from the Spéléo secours de l'Isère.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one seasoned in practice and the other not, had gone underground Thursday around 9:30 p.m. to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located on the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We had no news of them since then, said the same source.
"The speleologists should have come out around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical advisor to the Speleo Relief in charge of the relief organization.
Dozens of people on the spot
About twenty rescue workers, ten civilians from the French relief service, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on the scene.
Late this Friday afternoon, the two speleologists were located.
"This is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, passed the information to one of the rescue teams involved in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th Battalion of the Alpine Hunters of Chambéry, were found "exhausted, but not wounded".
They got lost in the network, turned back on their feet while waiting for rescue, said the prefecture.
Refueled, they should come out of the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
On Thursday, the German journalists' union invited its members to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services in the wake of new revelations about the activities of the US and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo search engines and messaging until further notice," she says in a press release.
She found "scandalous" information from the Washington Post, according to which the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected masses of information by infiltrating international networks that allow both firms to synchronize their servers.
"The searches carried out by journalists are as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union who claims 38,000 members.
Repainted lights: MP calls for Brigitte Grouwels to resign
Not everyone is pleased with Minister Brigitte Grouwels' plan to "relifting" the signs of traffic lights in Brussels.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in the centre of Brussels a test project to paint 16 signposts in the region in the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The aim is both "to increase security" and "the Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the long run, to paint all the Brussels traffic lights, at an estimated cost of around EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels deputy Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content to spend wildly the money of the Bruxellois in relifting operations of the signposts in the colours of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues her operations of Flemishization of the Capital", said Mr De Bock in a statement.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally painted the Brussels posts herself in dark-blue-black yellow.
According to the Member, there is no longer any difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels.
The Bruxellois deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who carries out the NVA program herself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
"For the record, Brigitte Grouwels was only elected with 2,245 votes, or 0.5% of the Brussels population!" concludes Mr De Bock.
the portico of Pont-de-Buis dismantled
The green portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on site shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national highway was diverted in the wake.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the prefecture of Finistère on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecocouv, manager of the portico.
This is the last of the three ecotax portals in the state of operation in the department of Finistère, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google-signed connected glasses.
They can acquire a earphone, a charger or a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers already having Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a protective cover made of micro-fibres or an intra-earphone earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction lenses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
It's been five years since my father got rid of the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I would continue to "follow it".
There is no recipe, no instructions for passing the wall of the invisible and finding his own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat as I was driving.
Another time, a sweet awakening in the middle of the night to watch his watch that no longer leaves me, placed on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
That's at least what I thought the day I found his body empty, clenched on that hospital bed with crumpled sheets.
Similarly, his funeral was an icy farewell focused on the meagre glow of candles surrounding his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by little appearances day or night, a little shy, a little erased, it quickly returned to my mind, evolving as it resumed its place in the landscape of my thought that was in mourning.
And then, she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother's person in any way but simply a woman I didn't really know, a woman who embodied that person, during her stay in life.
When she died, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and now I found her, full and full.
This detour of the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that loved people never leave us.
I look like my father, "both inside and outside" seems.
I've always been told.
I never believed him back then.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he got old, sick.
Now I wasn't afraid of him anymore and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I quit smoking, when I was scared, when I got hurt...
He was talking to me, constantly encouraging me, living in my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never prying.
I could have had a personal life.
He gave me my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who said dead people aren't forgotten, they're invisible.
My parents aren't here anymore, but I always feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life, makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week it's certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only there is always one thing that prevents me from accomplishing this moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me on the contrary and are part of my history and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I would wake up, I would rise out of bed, my father would wait for me on the landing and he would smile at me and rejoice that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he was sharing with joy what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I liked to share this moment with him and I am pleased to share this shared memory after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year earlier, she was on a trip with my family to Cuba.
That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor I was at the time.
Nevertheless, I realized my grief quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested me in the Middle East, to the point of making it a master's degree in a large school, were not, in hindsight, anodizing choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and speak of Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she instilled in me are always present, so I sometimes think about how she would want me to act at some point.
The same applies to my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and uprightness of the spirit of the one who was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes landing on me.
My mother passed away 19 years ago now.
Dead after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that triggers itself, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then, time eased the pain.
Only the lack, that void without an answer, that need of her, to confide me, to reassure me in the hollow of her sweetness.
Yet, she's there, silent presence, she's here and she's looking at me.
Every morning, I see her worried eyes landing on me, I see the dark circles that weigh her eyes down, the fine lines around the lips that cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the forehead on days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at 43.
We feel his protection at all times, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually relearned to smile, and uttering his name is no longer taboo but comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the hollow of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the morale is a bit reached.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the retreat of time makes us realize how much she was conductor and we try to stay in the path she had drawn us.
If a being loved you very much, the absence cannot take it out of your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I couldn't attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are consistent with his vision of things.
In fact, I have had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I do not sleep and I always wonder what he will think of it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, he will always be my reference.
It was kind of like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk between us.
Anyway, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It's almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6.
The immense pain that then invaded me has eased, of course, but it is still close to me.
Very often he "disembarks" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that when I wake up I am even sadder to see that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I told him no, he said "I'm going down" but in a voice so real that I woke up in a rush, anxious and I lit the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that he was going to arrive.
I still live in the same house, and often I feel watched and turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In all the rooms I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world would I leave this house where we were happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a responsible profession, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October has been Iraq's deadliest month since April 2008.
This Friday, Baghdad published official figures: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We don't tell the world to stand by us and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," Al-Maliki said this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not settled, it will spread, and what is happening in Syria will spread too.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? It spreads.
Noury al-Maliki spoke to the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, demonstrators protested against the Iraqi leader.
They waved signs accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
Cocainoman lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed in the open.
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Liverpool Assize Court
A great defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug-related activities after compromising himself because of his habit of using cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by the criminals as "a file of prime importance", was arrested at home in 2011 as a result of police listening operations directed towards Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a bar dinner with confreres.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought unlawfully to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then under police surveillance in a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire counties.
Together with 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for £1.5 million, as well as over £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, provided information to criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would be exposed.
Today, at Liverpool Assize Court, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Solicitors law firm in Blackburn, has fallen into disgrace after being found guilty on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He admitted possession of cocaine in a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing drugs, 60% pure, under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the depot, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta, who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, a compound of the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer went home, found out about the drugs, and they called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this Class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine. He stated that he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege."
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and attempted to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that clients sometimes called him at home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that he called on major players in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know that the law should not be violated, he is indeed a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with particular clients.
The relationship we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went far beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He obstructed the investigation of the police as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honour his profession, but disgraced her.
He was too close to some clients, particularly Scarborough, and let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said, "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 3 o'clock, I would have done so immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr.Ditta has moved from criminal attorney to criminal attorney himself as soon as he started getting drugs from criminal organizations."
His addiction to cocaine has compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the ulterior motives of the leading members of organized criminal groups who have instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and create a climate of trust among the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this confidence and tried to hide behind the varnish of his profession.
The serious and organized crime unit in Lancashire conducted the investigation of Mr. Ditta, who was convicted of the three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstructing justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecute criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his site, Ditta organized a question-and-answer session about himself, during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America, his last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be back on stage in December
Detroit News reports that the Queen of Soul will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board of the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
In November, Franklin recorded an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the illness she was suffering from, the famous interpreter of Respect told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she received were "difficult".
She says she's "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lighting
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometers of seafront covered with a coat of light: one could close the hot blow in Menton with the bill of illuminations.
Invoices which, unlike many municipalities, are also regulated by taxpayers, not by trade associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the network of public lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
There was a shooting at the Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to the local police, there were at least two injuries.
He would be an employee of the United States Transportation Safety Authority (TSA) and the perpetrator of the shots.
The incident reportedly occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff rushed to the exits or to the tarmac.
Very quickly the police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is being interrupted.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five saynetes imagined and performed by artists of the region, vignettes with a high dose of humour, teenagers are allowed to tame classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Society of Lyric Art of the Kingdom will come back with its Lyric Destinations, a formula that is now full room at the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving local artists the chance to show what they are capable of.
In addition to these activities, there was the Lyric Apéro, the benefit concert held last August, with the help of the soprano colorature Marie-Ève Munger.
It was a profit-making activity, along with the artistic dimension, and it helped the not-for-profit organization produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft to the ears as an air of The Bat.
Without giving precise figures, Yves Bergeron, Chairman of the Board of Directors, took advantage of yesterday's press meeting in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precarious nature of so many cultural institutions, the future is well under way, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
"Finance is afloat and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a stage we will pass in seven years," the administrator commented.
"I would even say beyond," added General Manager Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was accused of hostage-taking, kidnapping, threatening, carrying a weapon for a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The quick reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Paquet in a press release.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to go to court on Friday.
New application for class action against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new application for class action was filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that this time took place at the Saint-Joseph oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The application is based on the testimony of the complainant, identified as "J. J.", who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, Brother Submissive, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the oratory of Saint Joseph, where he served as a mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first recourse was for only three institutions, and when the rules were announced, many people told us: "I was in that place, can I register?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both remedies.
The unique feature of the newly filed class action is the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At present, the appeal involves complaints from 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Holy Cross brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those referred to in the first appeal, as several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the Congregation of St. Croix and the oratory of St. Joseph, which is a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "exercised moral, religious and psychological coercion on the victims", that they "were aware of the sexual abuse committed and nevertheless choked them", and that they "consciously and consciously chose to ignore the problem".
These latter accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the Sainte-Croix brothers, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The class action must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once admissibility has been admitted by the Court, the second stage, the hearings on the merits, is held.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were held on the merits.
Large fire in a trade
A fire severely damaged a business in the borough of LaSalle, Montreal, during the night of Thursday to Friday.
Rescue was called around 1:00 a.m. on Friday, due to a fire that had erupted in the basement of an Indian restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
Thirty firefighters who were dispatched to the site took almost an hour to control the fire.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said Richard Bordeaux, chief of operations for the Montreal Fire Safety Department.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly 20 housing units, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross has been requested, as residents of one of the apartments may need to be housed temporarily, the SIM said.
Much opposition to medical assistance in dying at the Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical assistance in dying in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few would like to end their lives, according to a spokesperson for the Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the focus was on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The President of the Réseau des soins palliatif du Québec also rejects the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she deplores.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to Suzanne Fitzback, vice-president of the Palliative Care Alliance.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of Mathieu-Froment-Savoie House in Gatineau, felt that the service would be unnecessary anyway.
They never ask us, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that Quebec's bill is disorienting the public about the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will follow suit.
For her part, Gatineau Liberal MP Stéphanie Vallée says that the notion of end-of-life will need to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan press outrages controversial media law
"It is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?" the newspaper said by challenging the bill and asking that it be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media court "will always be biased because it is an extension of government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would undermine Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the Speaker will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and refer it to parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have "control over the media." The Standard, for its part, said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had suffered a hard blow" and castigated the bill calling it "draconian."
The adoption of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate shopping centre last September.
The Kenyan media angered the authorities by broadcasting images of video surveillance cameras on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack allegedly stolen the luxury shopping centre.
The chief of police, David Kimaiyo, responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to interview them, although the summons was withdrawn following a raising of media shields.
Under the new bill, the media may be subject to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists to up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "delisted" or not being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his or her fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations."
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animous blogosphere."
By silenced the media, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
"Nobody will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"The politicians, given to themselves, would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering."
Kenyan legislators have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission in charge of wages and restored their mirobolant wages of about 532,000 shillings per month tax-free – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists from the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) in Laval caused a great deal of concern to the management of the Hôpital de la Cité-de-la-Santé during 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short-term departures, the pharmacy department found itself severely understaffed.
Almost 30% of the required staff was missing, making this fiscal year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
There was no use of troubleshooting, Ms. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities within the institution have been streamlined or reduced to level, while things are moving around.
We certainly worked hard to interest our young [pharmacist residents] so that they could come and stay here.
There was a competition of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 looks much easier for the CSSS pharmacy department.
Already, three pharmacists have returned to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to retain students have borne fruit, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
Now it's much better, said the pharmacist.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
It will therefore fill our departures from last year.
Still growing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or a predominance of young women in the trade, make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have a young environment and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancy, we almost always drive to three maternity leave when it's okay, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and we don't have pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old top model doesn't start his career in cinema by the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play Charlotte Gainsbourg as a young star in her next film, Nymphomaniac.
This pornographic drama grumps, in eight chapters that will come out in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), erotic memories of a four-year-old addicted to sex since her teens.
Stacy Martin's resemblance to her elder is striking: a twig silhouette, a diaphanous complexion and Franco-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to pose naked on iced paper will appear in much more sulphurous situations on large screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac made the temperature rise on the Web: Stacy Martin appears there in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he had recourse to X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies numerically: above the belt, it is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing her actresses into their last entrenchments, always for the better.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her yet.
A room of the Narbonne CGR evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Méga CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, as a result of tingling throats felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility had the room evacuated and alerted the firefighters for a suspicious smell.
Approximately 70 people left the session.
The people were examined and a full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on a tear-gas jet background?
Or involuntary incident?
Still, the management of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was ventilated and everything got back in order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and the customers regain the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She's trying to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkins.
Taking advantage of Halloween day, a woman tried to bring two kilos of cocaine into the country hidden in pumpkins on Thursday morning at the Montréal-Trudeau airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug could be detected.
The cocaine had been distributed in three pumpkins that had previously been emptied.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, CBSA spokesperson.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at the Montréal-Trudeau airport have made 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region accounted for a total of 1,653 drug seizures.
Air raid against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese Army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday early in the afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A shipment of SA-8 short-range surface-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new IDF air raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed either by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances similar to the one that took place on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting surface-to-sea Yakhont missiles delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their irritation at seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches bankruptcy
The credit rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet Republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's public debt securities goes to "B-", falling into the category of speculative investments.
It has a negative perspective, with S&P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be reduced again within a year.
"It is less and less likely that the government's strategy will ensure enough foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs," the US agency explains.
The agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and anticipates that the trend will continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.
These reservations, which the authorities use massively to support the local currency, hryvnia, collapsing, the agency increasingly considers a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs cash to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of intense tension with its Russian neighbour, furious at Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, which is still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years, and S&P estimates it to be 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, with a budget deficit, has been requesting assistance from the International Monetary Fund for months, which in 2010 had granted it a credit of $15.3 billion and has so far released only $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, notably by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF found this week that "large external financing needs" were "vulnerability", while noting "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "no improvement can be expected in the short term".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year", with presidential elections scheduled for 2015, the expert said, questioned at the AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" associated with the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels is conditional on the release of opponent Yulia Tymoshenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia's reaction," said S&P, who fears "trade restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukraine's exports, warned that in the event of the creation of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
US green light for the merger Publicis-Omnicom
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday they received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the first global advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the review period for the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," both groups announce in a press release.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other courts satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the operation to be carried out.
"The merger is also conditional on obtaining further regulatory authorizations and the approval of the shareholders of both groups," they added.
Congolese army chases M23 rebels
On Thursday, the Congolese army (FARDC) announced that its units would hunt M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be about to be beaten after being driven from the localities of the north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) which it had controlled since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurrection.
"We will prosecute M23 and acculate it wherever it hides because it is criminals," Colonel Olivier Hamuli, FARDC spokesman, told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the communities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setbacks would not alter his demands for peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and M23.
There have been clashes in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of insurgents to have fallen this week, as well as in the vicinity of Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the government garrison's flight and the passivity of the Monusco peacekeepers.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of strength, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff has been reorganized and the army has gone on an offensive against M23, changing the course of the war.
The rate of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to be coming to an end," predicts an expert in Congolese affairs, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historic - it would be the first time that the Kinshasa government has succeeded in defeating a major insurgency.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied with Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, which fiercely denies it, of supporting militarily the M23, which was originally made up of former mutinous Congolese soldiers.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali raised the possibility of military reprisals following the shelling in Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entry of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived with the M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable that we would ever be released by the army," says an inhabitant of this town bordering Uganda.
"We have lived in terror (of the M23), we are traumatized," added this man.
Tests carried out by the Institut Pasteur on a patient suspected of being infected with coronavirus have been found to be negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date".
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient was suspected of being infected, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already caused some 50 deaths.
Chevron, the second largest oil company in the United States, reported on Friday a decline in its quarterly profit due to the decline in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining behind the group's targets.
Its net income for the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged a profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company targets 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% increase in production expected by 2017.
Much of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures have increased by $7 billion over two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the sector as a whole.
Thus Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported on Thursday a falling net profit, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
School transport: the complaint found admissible
Since the beginning of the school year, the Scherbrooke Region School Board (CSRS) has charged a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students on school transportation to two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is in a position to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contributions were requested.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested," explains Ms Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediation and asked for an additional time to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to consult and to find solutions," Lefèvre says.
The Scherbrooke Region School Board (CSRS) did not wish to comment.
The organization only indicated that mediation is part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergency rooms of the Hôtel-Dieu
Faced with the frond that had been led for several months by some of the staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on 10 July to "decalate the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergencies which will not be able to intervene on 4 November".
An official request made "in order not to run any risk on the management of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but which also intended not to hinder the campaign of the PS a few months from the municipalities.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Even if the term "transformation" or "continuity change" is preferred to APHP.
Starting on 4 November, the firefighters who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency rooms at the Hôtel-Dieu will all have been instructed to take about 30 serious cases a day to the emergency rooms of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, the emergency interns will give way Monday to five general medical interns.
As for the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the current of the month.
"The emergency reception service of the Hôtel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4th", assures Loïc Capron, the chairman of the medical establishment commission (CME) of the APHP, who supports the management project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by the firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in emergency situations," he tempers, arguing that SMUR vehicles are permanently on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain there, he says.
But it is up to the LRA to decide on the closure of the emergency reception service.
"Things are being done gradually," replied Nicolas Péju, spokesperson for the ARS for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or we lied to him," says emergency doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Dismissed from his position as head of the SMUR at the beginning of July for having led the frond against the reorganization project, he defines himself as a "warning launcher" in the face of a "cynic" decision taken by "the medico-administrative technostructure".
"They are emptying and suffocating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he says.
For him, "if the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem".
But they are regularly engorged.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours waiting in the Lariboisière emergency room.
At the ARS, it is argued that 30 patients "dispatched" to several sites are not likely to represent an "alavant" in other emergency services, whose human resources will also have been strengthened.
Both in the ARS and in the APHP, we defend the "new hospital model" already launched since 7 October and which should continue to receive 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners are also expected to take part in the establishment of a "permanent ambulatory care".
"Where do we go if people are asked to self-diagnose," wonders Gérald Kierzek for whom "the concept of no serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
It's going to be like the level 3 maternity wards.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where there's the best care offer.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the braquet, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Santé.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will think about presenting a list.
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, a UMP adviser in Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Parisian UMP were for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, candidate PS, recalled Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, she would mark her clear disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, her spokesperson.
Even if the restructuring of the Hôtel-Dieu has its legitimacy in substance, we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of deferral to other hospitals.
Obama puts an end to IMF and World Bank wiretapping
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to put an end to its wiretapping of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, says an American official on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to regain control of the NSA wiretapping case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that the IMF and World Bank surveillance by the intelligence agency has been mentioned since the start of the scandal.
When asked about the subject, a US administration official replied: "The US does not conduct electronic surveillance of the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington."
Speaking anonymously, he did not specify whether such surveillance had been put in place in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had ordered that these practices be stopped in the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one that ended the wiretapping of UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved on Thursday a strengthening of controls over government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the retention of this information.
United Nations welcomes new poverty reduction goals
The United Nations will begin now to work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been put in place 12 years ago to combat world poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in promoting the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015 before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it is now time to "exceed national interests."
"I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These SDGs will build on the progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as conflicts erupt between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, twisting them, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to return; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
Worried about her country's future, she exchanged her work clothes for a "we want security" t-shirt in Portuguese before joining the crowd at Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, almost every day there have been reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by Rhodesia ruled by whites and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall back into open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is significant for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal reserves in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo each reject responsibility for the tensions.
The Renamo states that the government was at the origin of the recent clashes and that it launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of the Renamo, on 17 October.
The assaults on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman for Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for triggering the conflicts, and accuses her of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mr Mazanga said that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness," Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
"They are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep fighting," explained Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer from the open university and specialist of Mozambique.
None of them knows how to negotiate well and none of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of votes received by Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, is expected to win more votes in the elections.
Mazanga said that Guebuza – who is due to retire at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want a multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is not clear exactly what the capacity of the Renamo is, but it has carried out disruptive lightning attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
The instability has exacerbated the frustrations of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many also worried about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that the people responsible for the country's future are the government and the president, and that it is up to the president to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "models of lifestyle," says the author.
Thor's Legend could show that "the brute force does not weigh against the subtle trick," while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too violent, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland advocated a "detailed selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's great that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been advocating this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are "overtly didactic" means that children "get out of the way" with messages "highlighted" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from English and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything needs to be simplified or ended well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a history rather than declared.
The known basis of what you show and don't say.
One Hamas military-terrorist fighter was killed this evening and another wounded by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, reports from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they were shelled by an Israeli armoured vehicle.
NSA spying: the United States is "going too far," Kerry admits
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in spying, acknowledged Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first Washington admission in full controversy with Europe on the massive data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelation and denial between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time that an American government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in the NSA's interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I concede to you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London in which he participated from Washington on Thursday 31 October via video link.
In his retransmission, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has at length justified intelligence and information gathering practices by the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Referring to the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the American authorities had since thwarted many plans for attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have in fact prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these projects ahead of time," the US diplomacy boss argued.
And, said John Kerry to the Europeans, "I assure you that innocent people have not been deceived in this process."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far inappropriately," admitted the Secretary of State, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday night that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and that he was reviewing these practices so that no one felt mistaken."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which quotes documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, says that the program called "MUSCOLAR", and conducted with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to retrieve data from fiber optics used by Internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected in January alone - ranging from metadata on e-mails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google denied any connection to these practices.
Over the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have revealed that the NSA has reportedly intercepted massive data and communications from allies in the United States and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the American president was not aware of such listenings, Barack Obama refused to speak out on this subject, invoking national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied him that his intelligence agency had received tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even sent the bullet back to the European intelligence services which would have seized these communications, before supplying them to the NSA.
This would concern "military operations" in countries where NATO allies are cooperating with the United States and it would definitely not be aimed at Europe," said General Alexander.
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international spying network that has also sparked China's ire.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient Friday without its master asset, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the Ligue 1 club in a statement.
PSG, the leader of the championship ahead of Monaco, has released the list of players selected for this game of the 12th day, without the 32-year-old forward.
The press release simply states that he is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee upon his return from selection at the beginning of the month.
A Ceremony in Memory of the Crematized Deceased
The Crematorium du Père Lachaise organizes, at 11 o'clock, a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased crematized in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, socialist candidate for the Paris City Hall, will attend, and will explain, at a press conference, her proposals on funeral.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study carried out on 6 and 7 September among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a relative, it is the opposite: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book Death in Ash, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee on Funeral Ethics, emphasizes the "violence" that cremation constitutes for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "violence made to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is due to the "deletion of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Protestant countries still badly lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," replied Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Apprivoiser la mort.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame it.
Approving cremation is for François Michaud-Nérard, general director of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to plan for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that to which he would be entitled with a burial.
The annual survey of Ipsos shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one for their loved ones, whether religious (53%) or civilian (24%).
From now on, 73% of those who have chosen a cremation wish to organize a ceremony.
66% of the atheists or non-believers also desire it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For the past decade or so, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the burning of the ashes," observes Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the establishments now offer masters of ceremonies, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to appoint the deceased, to connect him with others, to evoke him, to give meaning to his death, to organize farewell.
This is the case at the Crematorium du Père Lachaise, since 1998.
Masters of ceremonies are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the Crematorium du Père Lachaise organizes, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of the people who were crematized in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is retransmitted online, to the attention of those who could not make the trip.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, the rehousing for rats turns into controversy
Earlier this week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
Faced with the urgency of the situation, the director of the Office Terres du Sud Habitat, proposed, in an exceptional and temporary way, to rehouse the couple and their three children in a new T4.
Yet the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
Joël Canapa, the director of the Office, believes that the case has taken on excessive proportions.
Rats, there's always been rats in the cities.
The deratization company makes two passages a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, 64 interventions have been made.
The neighborhood is not left to be abandoned, and the rats do not swarm in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, but for two rats, one will not kill a child.
"We did not invite the rats to our house," defends the father of the family who left his home to settle at the hotel.
We are soon without money and we expect a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended up falling by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended up falling on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The price has been affected by the decline of the dollar against the yen, detrimental to export values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) at 14,201.57 and the Topix yielded 11.23 points (0.94%) at 1,183.03.
Sony dropped by more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house the prey of flames in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out on Friday noon in Old Quebec was quickly brought under control.
More than 30 firefighters were sent to 9 Hébert Street.
The flames broke out in a house of three dwellings spread over four floors behind the courtyard of the Séminaire de Québec.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, many of whom intervened.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw visible smoke.
"Then the alarms were repeated, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck here," explained France Loiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec City firefighters.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of the fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the audience, in the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it was taken over more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of the headliners emerged in the Carolinas, and were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will feature the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of Stand Up for Heroes, a comedy and music evening for veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
The festival has grown, as has the world of comedy.
Many of the actors participating in this year's festival have gone through non-traditional channels, such as shows on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel ("The League" on the theme of FXX's joyfully lascif fantasy football) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the show "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the cast of the series "Parks and Recreation", but she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, along with other young actors with a singular voice (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction factors of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up actor, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at City Hall, in the centre of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He was telling me that, when he was here, sometimes he went down an alley between two buildings and said to himself, Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come and live here.
Oil prices continue to fall and are approaching $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about the size of stocks offset a report showing that China's electricity-intensive manufacturing sector is growing stronger.
The price of US reference crude for delivery in December fell from 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% drop for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which show a growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8 per cent in the third quarter, following a decline that had not occurred in the previous two decades.
The Brent crude, a reference for the international crude already used by American refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 per barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Calling into question the right to abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal in Texas reinstated some restrictions on the right to a voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This ruling means that a law adopted in July in that State and largely calling into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The decision of the Court of Appeal means that doctors who practice abortions will have to have an "admission privilege" at local hospitals.
The admission privilege is the right of a physician, by virtue of his or her status as a health care member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre for diagnosis or treatment.
The advocates of the IVG argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one third of state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a trial judge had held on the eve of the coming into force of the Act that the provisions dealing with admission privilege were unconstitutional.
But the Attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is running for governor, has asked the Court of Appeal to quash the first instance judgment that blocked the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has managed a strong return, on the audience side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% audience share.
But was the show at the rendezvous?
Some 10,000 candidates ran for the auditions of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the villain Sinclair, the perch André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
Passed the excitement of regaining their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored on this first bonus.
As every year, the first audition shows mix a wide selection of aspiring singers, for better and sometimes for worse.
Now, on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some have found their account there.
Many of them tried the New Star, and sometimes even went to the end.
Behind television screens, the vocations of successful singers are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make people laugh.
Court blocks decision on NYPD's control and search policy
On Thursday, a federal court of appeal blocked a judge's decision calling for changes to the New York Police Department's monitoring and search program and removed her from the file.
The United States Court of Appeal (second circuit) stated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the outcome of the city's appeal.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and interrogate citizens.
The City appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and associated training program.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments relating to the application for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be removed from the file because she violated the judges' code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of interviews with the media and public statements in which she responded publicly to the court's criticisms.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their monitoring and search program.
It appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras carried on the body in the areas where the largest number of controls are carried out.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of retaining the names and addresses of those who were rejected after police control.
The City's appeal is scheduled to be heard after March 14, 2014.
The control and search tactics have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This system of control and excavation has existed for decades in some form, but the number of controls registered has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 controls that mainly concerned black and Hispanic men.
A legal action was brought in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's monitoring and search program say they will put an end to unfair practices, allow for more effective and trusted police forces, and can change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say that these changes undermine the morale of the police without reducing crime, would be a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police under pressure after police numbers have been drastically reduced over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that she was not putting an end to the constitutional control and search practices, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Tenants must go to vote because each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of the accommodation that goes to the City in taxes.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each unit.
We are obliged to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
When we go to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We can't afford to afford $100,000 fireworks, $4 million to $5 million in land in case...
Go vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entering the 500 m2 of the Elysée kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the way up to becoming a chef nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy, including at their holiday sites, and fed countless large numbers of this world in a near-anonymous way that he only breaks today, at retirement time, at the age of 60.
The man with his open face, his skull and his intellectual glasses, born on 24 October 1953 at the Ferté-Saint-Aubin, holds a CAP of pastry.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I have passed from one castle to the other!", ironically says Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manners of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Ms Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen", to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
Do not displease heads of state who displayed a relative indifference to earthly foods, "they are all greedy", denounces kindly Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a somewhat more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like".
The current Head of State, who regained the lost kilos before the presidential campaign, has "no request for a specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially during the state dinners at the Elysée: he must serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand if there were any mistakes.
The now former chef of the kitchens of the Elysée, who had a drink Tuesday evening with his team, his family and friends, leaves with a pinch in the heart."François Hollande came to greet me".
He said praises.
"His human side has come out," he says.
The chef will be replaced by his assistant, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who for his part has been at the Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-unit building, located at 15 Hébert Street, was the subject of three fire alarms.
The fire broke out in the front, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid response of firefighters prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built in close proximity.
The burning house housed four units, but no tenant was on site at the time of the fire.
The damage was all limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the Sappers have ruled out the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wall Street Wolf: release of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets escape some images of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will undo you in his role of crazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "long island stockbroker, who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a large corruption case on Wall Street."
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then set up a scam that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man chained the parties, the women, the drugs.
Decadence and excesses of all kinds are the key words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have recovered the magic that had united them on Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its long mounting.
It looks like the movie finally lasts 2:45.
On December 25, he will be able to take part in the Oscar race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson reportedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a bogus tip on an affair involving the then incumbent Minister of the Interior, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his "beautiful special advisor."
It was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, with hacking Pawlby's voicemail and "permanently crashing in front of his door," but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now NotW's editor-in-chief, is not the kind of man to stay in front of people's homes hoping to surprise them, it's the kind of man to like to present the story to people to see what they say about it," said Mr. Edis.
He said that NotW used three ways to investigate the issues: telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, the monitoring, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says otherwise, but we say "Of course we do."
Rumours about an affair involving Clarke were taken up first by NotW's editorial office when a source, having a sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said that she had been told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A tape, on which pirated voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private investigator's computer that involved Ms. Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the time the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
In the meantime, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Ms. Pawlby's every move.
In a voice message he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blankett.
The Board heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he was with co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks deny that they conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having carried out telephone hacking.
Barack Obama welcomes Iraqi Prime Minister, in the throes of violence
The U.S. President was due to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, in search of help from the United States to fight the strongest wave of violence in five years.
In October, Iraq experienced its most deadly month in five and a half years, according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday, 1 November.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations has even higher scores, with 979 deaths and 1,902 injuries.
This violence is becoming increasingly deadly despite strengthened security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shia-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of American troops, the level of violence is causing fear of a new fire while neighbouring Syria is in the throes of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot dead in the streets or even in their homes, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has encouraged this upsurge of violence.
On Friday, further violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five car bombs north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunnite extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
The violence is at the centre of talks in the United States with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the American President, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had drawn an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since arriving in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has increased meetings with the executive and Congressional elected officials.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But they also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, who attributed him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence through his "sectarian and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make Nouri Al Maliki understand that "Iran's pernicious influence in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
Beijing accuses Uighur group of attack on Tiananmen
On Friday, the Chinese head of internal security accused a group of Uighur separatists in Xinjiang of being behind the car bomb attack that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, hit the crowd in the famous Chinese capital square, symbol of the deadly repression of 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement in Eastern Turkestan of instigating this attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority based in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province Eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there driven by independenceist demands.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated," Meng told Hong Kong's Phoenix TV channel.
"The group that stood behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan," he added, his remarks being echoed by the new China agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of Uighur origin and specified that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident resulted in 42 injuries.
The Islamic movement in Eastern Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican probes contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major survey around the world on how parishes deal with sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asked participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national conference of bishops, with the instruction to get as many answers as possible.
The information will be used for an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper from the United States.
A spokesman for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide how to probe the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: Army attacks last rebel fief
The indomitables of M23, some hundreds of fighters, were cut off at an altitude of almost 2000 metres on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It has not stopped since this morning, fighting continues despite the night," told AFP a resident of Jomba, who was reached by telephone around 12:30 p.m., according to which a girl was shot and wounded in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have repulsed the rebels a little bit."
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" in Jomba before going up to the front for a "sweeping operation".
There was very clear evidence behind him of crackling with small arms.
From Bunagana, a political fief and the last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the fighting entered "a final phase", as FARDC "circulated the residual M23 positions to dislodge them".
Since the resumption on Friday of clashes between the Mouvement du 23 Mars (M23) and the army, the Monusco does not participate directly in the fighting, but it provides government troops with decisive support in intelligence, observation and planning.
In the late afternoon, dozens of soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, went up towards the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, a border post with Uganda, military personnel assisted by civilians were loading a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, to replace another machine shelling M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila called on Wednesday night once again for the rebels to "demobilize voluntarily" or be disarmed "by force", but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December without results for the moment.
On the spot, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, the only thing left is the Ugandan mediation to organise the signature," said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side.
The M23 was born from a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23, which Kigali and Kampala refute.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its subsoil is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday, according to the United Nations, the return movement to the DRC, which had begun in the morning, reversed in the middle of the day.
"This morning we went back to our fields, but the military told us to retreat," told AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back.
There's a feeling that the shots are getting closer to the people.
Early in the evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical, the beast of the stage
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, sung and dance productions take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally found its voice.
It's a revolution: French-style music is asserting itself as a genre of success.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most attempts were entangled in ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Misérables bore the halo of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and Stage Entertainment at Mogador changed the situation.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles as hit tubes.
The first one takes over, this Christmas, his excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the next world premiere of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "La Belle et la Bête" may well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other stages, musical performances such as "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are in tune with success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histoires de comédies musicales" and lecturer at Théâtre du Châtelet, analyses the reasons for the hard-won success.
How do French musicals evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First there are the "musical shows" that evolve according to the producers...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a true history as in 1789, Les Amants de la Bastille.
Others make a fifteen-year leap back on the pretext that you can serve about anything when you have Matt Pokora in the lead.
Then we have the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that bring us back to the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest composer alive.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musicals of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are trying to break through.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Kiss of Spider Woman" or "The Awakening of Spring" have difficulty being funded.
Do we have enough artists like Broadway who can sing, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of musicals, it's very different.
Young people are trained in these occupations in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The talent pool is as large as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are the provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often from boulevard theatre intended for adults and not for young adults.
Musical performances fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love reality television and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
To propose beautiful young men (often talented) to lead a musical show is the assurance of a craze of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are carefully maintained by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a province Zenith.
Mayonnaise went up to Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major rooms in France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver in the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury, on Friday morning at around 5:30 a.m., in the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeyeaart, towards Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is unharmed.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00 a.m. at the accident site until the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
This situation, however, did not cause much traffic congestion as the accident took place at the level of the exit of Hoeilaart.
Traffic could therefore be diverted by this exit/entry of the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was seriously injured as a result of an accident at an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer committed but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat from the "Caribbean Pirates" attraction.
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: Army prepares new assault
Children play on a charred tank belonging to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on 31 October 2013 in eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing Friday for a new assault against the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The goal is to dislodge the M23 from the hills that overlook Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took Bugina Hill, which overlooks Mbuzi Hill.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by herself.
It will only remain the hill of Runyonyi.
"Celle de Chanzu is not very strategic," North Kivu governor Julien Paluku told the AFP.
Mr. Paluku is planning to travel to Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fief and the last stronghold of the rebellion, the town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was taken over on Wednesday by the Forces armées de la République démocratique du Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducibles of the M23, are cut off at nearly 2,000 meters of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba
In Jomba, a resident who had reported close fighting on Thursday throughout the day indicated that the situation had been "quiet since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed in the fighting the day before and buried.
One girl was shot and three others were injured, one of whom was seriously evacuated by FARDC, adding the witness called by AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have failed to report any loss of life.
NSA revelations increase companies' paranoia about state surveillance
On a beautiful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew at low altitude over the British Consulate of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
By order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explain that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, Director of U.S. Intelligence Services, again stressed in September that the U.S. does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who became a whistleblower, began to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information about the secrets of surveillance in the United States, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazil's oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever sparked companies' paranoia about state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that made the vase overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data should be used for their mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States represents as much a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY.
However, in all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has passed on industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
"This is not the right way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn't let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
However, the scale and sophistication of the American spy agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations has been a shock to some companies that until then thought that China represented the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing, as European officials have become aware that the data stored in the United States are regulated under the laws of this jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, some 10% of non-US members have abandoned their plans to use an American cloud storage service provider after revelations about the American Prism data exploration program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says: "Our clients are asking us a question they didn't ask us a year ago: where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders say that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that the powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been one.
"This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Managing Director of the chemical producer BASF.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, should this leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long been pounding the message that it is at least imprudent to pick up a free USB flash drive at a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the Audi car manufacturer, says that the collection of mobile phones before board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its managers to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad because of the risk of harming the integrity of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SME often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access," the BfV warns in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies to economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, who were second-degree perpetrators of piracy of economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a well-known German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former French director of internal intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, believe that their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found in a wrestling mat rolled up in his high school gymnasium, believe that their son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 stuck in a carpet standing behind the stands of his high school gymnasium.
The sheriff's investigators in Lowndes County concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old's family disagreed with these findings.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as stated in the sheriff's conclusions.
"They think it defies all logic, the laws of physics and common sense," added Crump.
They are convinced that these findings were made for the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a satchel and he was returned to them in a mortuary bag," he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several important questions remained unanswered.
What's the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis" to open a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died by "positional asphyxiation."
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are several questions that still need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers evidence that would justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the sheriff's office in Lowndes County was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a judge from South Georgia ordered the authorities to hand over all video surveillance footage that the investigators had examined.
The adolescent's parents stated that they hoped that the video images would contain clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on allergies in children for schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention issued a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines that the U.S. government publishes, as the number of school-age children with food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to educate teachers and staff about food allergies in children, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine – the EpiPen brand auto-injector being the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in case of life-threatening anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently updated the regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I feel something stings my tongue," "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue," or "I have tingling on my tongue."
NSA case highlights total lack of debate on intelligence
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand offends itself in public by summoning the ambassador of the United States on 21 October, and on the other, prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumour of the presence on its board of Edward Snowden?
In my view, there are two levels of response on the part of the French Government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is that of the extent of American surveillance on all communications in France.
Isn't it surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart on the one hand the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the listenings of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't there be a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy of political and other issues around the world, we consider that, in the eyes of the American power, this is an important light.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means to outrage us with this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA concerning terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American collaboration?
The implementation for roughly ten years of highly powerful interception technology tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States in particular have put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of information on an almost daily basis, which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French thanks to NSA resources.
France can be led, for example, to transmit whole blocks of data on the Sahel region to American services, and, in return - as has already been said - Americans can give information to the French about other regions of the world.
So the fundamental question behind this NSA case is not so much the capacity or the right of countries to acquire interception tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly in Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the scope that must be theirs, and ultimately the question of infringements of freedoms.
What is the real risk of the United States? a deterioration of its image?
I don't know how they can be punished.
The risk to the Americans can be twofold.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest summit of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case for Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to American providers subject to American laws, and thus to the control of the NSA.
Last but not least, the wide-ranging revelations from media around the world, which are helping to trigger a debate on intelligence surveillance practices that have hitherto been virtually non-existent, could lead legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose "undetermined sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of the newborns will no longer be rigidly attributed to them at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to register a "undetermined" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions about sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors created, bruised and swept away.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, the intersexuality being part of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term for people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to attribute it, then to wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering surgery, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York City and a specialist in sexual identification, said the new German law "seems to be a good idea."
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious illnesses that require surgery, but most children do not," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without operation, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as either.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual traits (such as muscle mass, hair, chest and stature), primary sexual traits (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and bias-motivated crimes.
Young boys of non-compliant gender now have special camps for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "neutral" after winning her appeal trial that allowed her to keep an "unspecified" sex for life.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators in this country, which is a very Catholic country, signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school books.
The American site Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new kingdom where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are being overturned."
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also stated on Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be attributed to babies at birth.
"The role of parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know your child's sex," she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the beautiful Greek god who had a double sex.
And barely a decade ago, the medical community considered the gender to be a slate, which can be erased and redrawn.
But from now on, many people question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his or her sexual re-assignment as he or she grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, the psychiatrist was not called, and the surgeon was called.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was initiated by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be malleable.
He enshrined the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan", his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a sloppy circumcision to castrate him entirely, also taking away the testicles, and raising him like a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn't," Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher stated that some physicians "always repeat this model."
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say "they are not satisfied with the result."
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
The doctors could not really say whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised like a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
When he was 18, he suffered from vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing something was wrong, he asked for his medical file.
What he found horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, taking testosterone treatment and getting his breasts removed.
Surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based non-profit organization Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law "invites labelling and stigmatization."
"Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their child a "undetermined" sex," she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that his organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized as third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal genre," she added.
German law deals with the attribution of sex at birth.
It is not a battle that young children should wage at that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter suffers from a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that German law "will empower" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because of the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29 years old, Katie is married and interned in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
"The law gives parents some latitude so they don't have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
This gives them time to do some tests and understand them, and a delay before they enter "male" or "female".
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don't have to rush for surgery that's irreversible.
"This puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid they will not do what they need to do," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and it is something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself or herself.
Letta confident in the longevity of her government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition as the Senate vote approaches to remove Silvio Berlusconi from office.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the centre-left leader said he "closedly intends" to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper chamber of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax evasion in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where it has more opponents than supporters, pronounces its dismissal.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on 2 October by his refusal to yield to Berlusconi's injunctions which already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that a U.S. Transportation Security Agency officer, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of shots.
Firefighters called at the scene of the tragedy claimed to have responded to a call for "multiple injuries".
"The police are on the spot," says the airport on its Twitter account, while television footage showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesman for the American Transport Security Agency (TSA) told AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed an evacuee on a stretcher, and a second one carried on a wheelchair.
The incident occurred at approximately 9:30 a.m. local (12:30 p.m. in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, the airport also specified.
The Los Angeles Times reports that the teminals 2 and 3 are in the process of evacuation.
The ASD spokesperson was not in a position to confirm immediately whether one of his employees was injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport were suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas operative in Gaza-sces
Israeli tank fire killed an Islamist Palestinian Hamas activist on Thursday and seriously injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, reports from health services sources.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in that area, as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli army merely evoked a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called a "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's Campaign Considered to Fall Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers to President Barack Obama have considered, in the greatest secrecy, replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event that appears in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's highly awaited 2012 campaign book, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times got a copy of the book to be published and told Thursday night that the president's close collaborators had conducted "in-depth group work and polls at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's eviction could help Obama with his re-election as his hopes dwindled.
According to The Times' political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, former White House Secretary General Bill Daley, to measure how the replacement of the Vice-President by former Secretary of State Clinton could affect the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been staunchly kept within the Chicago Field Headquarters and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisors to the president – including Daley, Obama Jim Messina's former campaign leader, and former White House advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that change was under consideration.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal ties", before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said I'd looked at a whole series of questions, and that was one of them," Daley told the newspaper.
Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so we thought, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley described the exam as "cooperative," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would be beneficial in the election.
"The campaigns don't spend a lot of money on polls and focus groups unless they seriously consider taking action," Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was reviewing the replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss was aware of any changes.
Although Daley said he did not think the president "was aware" of the possible change, the former secretary general admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political polls had arrived on Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed that Obama did not know that Biden's removal from the presidential list was being examined.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
Do you want some ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world's first fluorescent ice cream based on jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to recreate the brilliant protein chemically.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that, since ice cream starts to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," said: "It's something incredible but we're still in the early stages of production, and 2 g of this stuff costs about £200."
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts to shine.
We have tested it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've created because jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about £140.
But it tastes pretty good!
Charlie's experimental approach, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice cream fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But its next creation looks even more ambitious.
He added: "I would really like to develop an invisible ice."
It's intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to do it.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
The singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, revealed on Thursday his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for the residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning as he looked at the trees and made the famous 21st Tai Chi movement, with his hands as a musician cracking the air," writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was master tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised her husband, the week before her death, to get him out of the hospital and to take him to their home in Springs, Long Island.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in the last few years.
And even if we're city dwellers, it's our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of life he had," she adds.
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more pingled.
Over the past two years, I have not distributed a single candy and I will certainly not do so this year.
But the stats show that I'm the crooked sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is trends.
Costumes are expected to represent $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are infuriating.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, burgers and carrots.
As for the men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet the men from Daft Punk's space will figure among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought after disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no harm in staying traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my astonishment, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, the Americans are going to spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of curious dogs dressed like hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, you don't growl.
The Americans are going to spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
That's great news for the 41 million kids who go hunting candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we are going to buy and, don't tell us any stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion grains of maize.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to figure out yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and this includes these amazing pictures of you peeing on that your friends put on Facebook and that you can't take away and on which a guy you like leaves a comment of the "beautiful head" style.
I mean, let's talk pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to La Grosse Pumpkin when we were kids, and sculpting a pumpkin in the shape of a lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – it's something we've been doing since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the "baby pumpkin trend" only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these pumpkins and didn't have to sit in them.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin-lanterns that slowly wither on the porch of your house probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you're looking to get more noticed, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try sculpting their 922 kg pumpkin.
Royal Bank of Scotland will in-house create a bad bank with 38 billion pounds (€45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relationship with London and speed up its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of doubtful assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it up within three years.
RBS also stated that it would enter a provision for depreciation of additional doubtful debts of four to 4.5 billion pounds over the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the quartering structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free up £10-11 billion of capital, thus strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would make it possible to draw a line on the past, the government having in particular been accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and the UK," Ross McEwan, new Managing Director, told the press.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior features bucket seats and 6-point harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, a service that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support, and vehicle storage between events.
Bowler's CEO Drew Bowler said: "The rally fans who join Bowler have changed."
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try out different forms of rallies in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of rallies raids.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is going to be really exciting."
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable ledge in a quarry
Ruby, a Cocker Spaniel, had escaped after a minor road accident.
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry
The firefighters went down the cliff to pick up the bitch and save her from a certain death.
A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after firefighters were called to recover it safely while he was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable projection of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old Cocker Spaniel, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Department.
They had desperately searched for their lost bitch and made a call to social media sites after she disappeared in the quarry following a minor accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-sighted person walking his dog spotted Ruby on a ledge in the quarry, stuck 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station rushed to the scene and came down as a reminder to save Ruby by using an animal stretcher to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical relief specialist Andy Clayton said: "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She absolutely did not move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies later.
It was a very unusual call.
I can't believe someone noticed the dog.
Technical rescue specialist Peter Lau said: "Ruby was very lucky to get away with it."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a check; his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was terrified of watching the rescue."
I didn't think she was up there at first.
It was surprising to have him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each one of them was absolutely great.
Mr. Alderson, of Keighley, added: "We were afraid that she would fall but she did not move."
Firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never dredged Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He draped me when I was 18 years old."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger stated that he " categorically denies having made advances to Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", landed at the top of the charts this week.
Beijing challenges Turkmen Islamic movement
"Backstage support for the attack came from the Islamic Movement of Eastern Turkestan based in Central and Western Asia," said the head of Chinese security agencies to a Hong Kong TV channel, according to a video posted online Thursday evening on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (PCC), spoke in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a particular organization after Monday's attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uighurs of the same family in the predominantly Muslim region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, threw their car loaded with gas cans at the entrance to the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two and injured 40.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, which claims to be fighting for the independence of Eastern Turkestan, the former name of the Chinese Xinjiang, was classified by the United Nations in 2002 as a member organization of Al Qaeda.
This movement is often identified by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disturbances in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The break-up of Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another worrying history of independence.
This time, we are being warned that an independent Scotland would be obliged to join the European free movement zone in order to be able to join the EU.
And now we're hearing stories of passport control in Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's wall.
Although Strathclyde's newspaper indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the headlines (and it was to be expected).
Neither has anyone said that EU Member States spend much of their time circumventing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continued failure to comply with the rules would be a slim concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from Scots.
So it's a story that's not one.
And a story so old that it is now frozen: I heard for the first time the bobard that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
Yet, one has forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why exchange the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at a standstill.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe officially died.
Across Europe, parties that oppose the EU or advocate the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the alternative eurosceptic party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections in September and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has been a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the snag on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments with excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Rather, the European system has put on its members favourable exchange rates for German exporters – something German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe find themselves with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise related to productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German companies in the energy sector at the expense of the consumer – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a stumbling block in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Not all wage freezes in the world will prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap US shale gas.
As a result, the revolt is rumbling, especially in France, one of the EU's leading leaders.
After the war, the French political elite regarded the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy struggling.
As a result, Marine Le Pen's far-right party, the National Anti-European Front, has just won a crucial by-election, sending the socialists back to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split of the right will automatically favour the left.
What is Marine Le Pen doing with his new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create a single anti-currency and anti-European bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
That is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-currency feeling unique in Europe will unify and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will come back to something that will look more like the free "Europe of the Nations (sovereigns)" favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will look soft in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels for a walk.
I believe that Scotland could live up to a freer European agreement provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – and it should be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour Exchequer, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent Conservative/Liberal-Democratic coalition.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Growing older earlier
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter's breasts and pubic hair start growing at 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr.Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young American women and represent a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually it doesn't indicate a rapid shift towards full puberty," said Kaplowitz.
Obvious signs of development, such as the budding of the breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has only been a slight advance in the age of the first period in the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, while in 1970 it was 12 years and three quarters.
"Once the chest has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "early" when chest development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – it's something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution may justify tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first period and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and a small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for medicinal and hormonal treatment are based on the child's age, development rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with medication but recognizes that "controlling puberty can alleviate certain behavioural problems and the feeling for girls to be different from others."
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their period.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will manage hygiene issues," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period at 10.
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules, she wasn't prepared emotionally.
She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no consistent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz says the most credible hypothesis is the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study of girls aged 6 to 9 years who linked the percentage of fat to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, early puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate, to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on the face and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians attending the PAA conference stressed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to speak with their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early must be reassured that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The tribute to the folk of the Coen brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the 1961 Greenwich village and folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémathèque française, had won the Palme d'or in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Without the ability to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have set their sights on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on global pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and the songs performed live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to be an accomplished musician and folk singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich adornment in "Gatsby the Beautiful" for less glinting clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the swearing out with the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" recounts over a week the tribulations of a folk singer who can't break through and gets angry with the whole earth.
It accepts backwards replacements at a raised foot in the studios.
Without accommodation, he makes the tour of the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
A documentary air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not careerist but integrity, with self-destructive behaviour," Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel with several Oscars and awards in Cannes, told the press.
If Llewyn Davis didn't exist, the two filmmakers fans of folk music built their story on real personalities of the time such as the folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this district of New York called to become "the epicentre of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as writes journalist Elijah Wald, Van Ronk's friend.
The film then takes on documentary looks, from the dusty music label invaded by 33T unsold inhabited by an old unsold secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafés where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by integrating a funny character who is constantly going through the film: a beautiful red cat with a crackling look, companion of fortune of Llewyn Davis.
Asked about how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having "grown up in Tennessee, bathed by blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is needed to "be considered good", "random can also launch someone's career", and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to be caught by anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves".
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", died.
He'll never know the word retreat.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times dedicated him as "the author of spy novels who knew too much."
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theatre of the 198th and 199th installments of the famous series of spy novels.
Physically diminuted by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was moving on this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published each year, Gérard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, ensured that he ignored the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"Undoubtedly between 120 and 150 million all countries together," he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment in a building on Avenue Foch, a stone's throw from the Arc de Triomphe, his evil eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which SAS' adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books on the coffee table between the bronzes or ivorys reported from the 130 surveyed countries to locate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional blanket with the photo of a young woman with a advantageous chest, carrying a pistol or an assault rifle.
Inside, his serene altesse (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, an Austrian aristocrat who was disagent and a contractual agent of the CIA to pay for the repairs to the family castle, went after all the wicked of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, then jihadists from the 90s onwards.
With each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never had the pretense of being a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people I don't send messages to.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, Albert London type, who went there and came back with real and long investigations."
SAS' father said "do some kind of geopolitical soap opera."
"I am constantly following my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of the AFP, diplomats, people of the services that I know for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premonitionary: for example, a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command centre that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Way to Damascus".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Cairo Conspiracy", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he recounted the columns of 4X4 jihadists who founded on the Malian capital.
I am not a guess, Gérard de Villiers defended himself, I simply make hypotheses from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my hypotheses come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his IBM daisy typewriter dating back to 1976 "whose pieces have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to the pen.
On the walls of his office are hanging assault rifles AK-47, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always well received in Africa, where I have many readers.
Gérard de Villiers had said: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age".
He won't die and he won't retire.
No more than me.
Aviators quarrel over seat width while large controls are at stake
The dispute rages between the major aircraft manufacturers over the width of the tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for bitter confrontation at the Dubai Air Show which is taking place this month.
The dispute concerns the width of seats proposed on long-haul flights for economy-class passengers – who are not always the most courted by airlines, but whose space allocation is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but its big American rival Boeing says it should be the airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as the aircraft manufacturers sought to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, hoping eventually for a record number of orders at the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The manner in which the seats will be placed at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the "mini-jumbo" segment.
Boeing states that its redesigned "777X" will accommodate 406 people in economy class seats more than 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus states that the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
The aeronautics giants often exchange hits on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus is calling directly to the public before the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X should take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We were recently able to see what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept that?"
" Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than regional turboprops," said John Leahy, Airbus' commercial director.
As eating habits change, people grow, but the seats in the aircraft have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing Jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American weight of 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average size of the 21st century American is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival clings to a seat concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly-named jet set was narrower.
Airbus adds that it commissioned a study that indicated that an additional inch in seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disagrees with Airbus' figures regarding seat width and claims that it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that the cabin experience does not depend solely on the width of the seats.
"It's really about providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their business," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more a question of having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute lies a race to control aircraft for an estimated amount of at least $700 billion at market price in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters said for the first time in July, seating configuration is exactly what drives the battle between the latest aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim seat-per-seat performance in their latest long-haul dual-engine models 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's announced performance depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in unit costs is small compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
" Boeing is doing this to be able to set up more seats and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Director of Comfort Passenger at the European Airbus aircraft manufacturer.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favour of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
"A seat width of 18 inches would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus' proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777," said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a list of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Aircraft sellers who travel around the world take with them even a meter to check competing configurations.
While venturing to offer comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer planes with high density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional trips.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for greater cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the experts say that it is unlikely that his call to the aviation industry to put in place a size standard for seats will succeed, but that it could make it forget the 777X sales wave.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the compensation proposal for founder and CEO Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not restrictive but tarnishes the image of Larry Ellison, the third fortune in the world just abhorred by the victory of his boat at the America's Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group that he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had had a negative vote on his salary.
Oracle's boss has renounced a bonus of 1,2 million dollars for the fiscal year 2013 closed in May due to the bad performances of the group, that it has missed its growth objectives, but it has collected approximately 77 million dollars related to stock-options.
His fixed salary is just a symbolic dollar.
Over the 2013 offset year as a whole, Oracle's net profit increased by 3.5% while the stock exchange price jumped by 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotin vaccine could suppress the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice for life from nicotine dependence.
Further tests are needed before the human testing begins, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track all nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting his nicotine dose.
During the tests, mice vaccinated and then given nicotine continued their normal activity.
But mice that had not been vaccinated "were appeased," the researchers said, indicating that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have been found to be ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it transforms liver cells into antibody plants.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the anti-nicotin vaccine, and it can help them lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but pointed out that much more research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike on Friday in Pakistan, was learned from the security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has already been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the activist movement claimed this time that he had lost his life in the strike in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone fire," said a senior security official.
The previous day, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, informed the British government that discussions had begun with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied having changed the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to determine whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several State ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeid own two restaurants and a coffee shop, after their expiry in August 2005, without a call for tenders.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former Assistant Secretary General, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
In the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government has lobbied for a tender for leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, leases for Circular Quay companies, which brought in approximately $2.5 million per year to the Obeid, were renewed without a call for tender.
Mr Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tendering.
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr Obeid, who, admitted Mr Tripodi, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid's direction at the Department of Fisheries.
"Is the topic discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial lease policy?" said Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheaty to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," Mr. Tripodi replied.
I don't remember what we talked about, but it wasn't that.
At least not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, says official
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, says a military official at Fox News.
The official did not specify the target, but said that there was at least one target.
The Associated Press reported that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass an "authenticity" test.
The Government is currently studying the possibility of introducing an "authenticity" test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while considering extending the measures of repression.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion designed to prevent visas 457 from being used for unskilled positions or as a diverted means of bringing family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was released today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's discourse on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"The shocking statements about "foreigners going back to the end of the line" and "jobs for Australians first" are an unpleasant return at a time when trade unions were asking for a protected labour market," she told the Australian India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the whites had to be protected – and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo to this historical artifact.
The discussion paper outlines the 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, while the others are under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for "whether the job offer is genuine in the event that the applicant is a personal relationship or partner of the owner or the person concerned within the sponsoring company".
Companies may also be required to declare the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, have actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum-seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man's panicked son, 9 years old, was travelling with him to Australia and has found some comfort since his father's death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the UK Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring the United Kingdom together."
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will cover a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government increased the estimated cost of constructing the high-speed link between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the reinforcement of rail capacity and the improvement of the length of journeys for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel periods between Glasgow and Edinburgh of up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a problem of capacity in our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to support "undoubtedly" Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight to the overall high-speed rail project across Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK government to explore options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and completing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with British ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps."
Rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being.
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the United States' move to relax electronic device regulations.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases provided they are in "airplane" mode.
Passengers can already do so for most of the flight, but many people find it difficult to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision that requires U.S. carriers to do significant work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they have no immediate intention of changing their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was reviewing the announcement but noted that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in effect in Australia.
"CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft," she said.
The issue is subject to regulation that requires aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already spoken to CASA about her intention to expand the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a review of CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi) on our aircraft," said one spokesperson.
Qantas stated that it is currently complying with the current rules.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we have no immediate intention of changing that," she said.
The FAA's decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA's decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will be required to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and passenger instructions.
"As soon as an airline has checked its fleet's tolerance, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," the FAA said.
In the rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stowed under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four injured in a violent fight
The small commune of Pia experienced an unusual excess fever on Thursday evening.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about thirty people according to testimonies gathered...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a fight involving several people broke out on the side of the Post Office.
At least four light injuries are reported.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore’s lenders take advantage of the middle classes forced to tighten their belts
At a pawn shop in Bendemeer, Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay for the tuition fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, became this week the third pledge loan company to be introduced on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Selling jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Mrs.Amirthalinga – but it's almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's pledge lenders charge an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local funder with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawn lenders have the advantage of not asking for a credit check or proof of salary, and can unblock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to pawn lenders as families feel the pressure of rising the cost of living and the over-indebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and low-cost credit fuelled by too lax a monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawn lenders to make up for the difference as their economies slow down.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the growing debt of households, mainly as a result of the rise in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has just emerged this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle or bottom [wage scale] are looking to supplement their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have resulted in people quickly pledging their personal belongings to touch the cash value of their jewellery.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items pledged in the city-state's 200 pawnshops are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's pledge Grandma's gold chain and we'll come back for it next month."
In Thailand, EasyMoney, the largest pawnshop operator, recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
The increase is such in the bond lending sector that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer boutique and 15 other boutiques like this one in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four boutiques – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its general manager.
The company will fund them using 60% of Singapore's $66 million raised this week when it was introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have been criticized for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah indicates that pledging not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Customers mortgage property they already own, and monetizing their personal property does not increase household debt," she says.
Pledging is becoming increasingly socially accepted as a means of securing secured financing in the short term.
The people who go to the pawnshops are not only those who have financial problems.
The affluent people of Singapore also go to ValueMax pawnshops to pledge gold bars or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all layers of society.
"They can be wealthy people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investments, or small businesses that need cash to get through a difficult course," says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor charged with child pornography in Nova Scotia
A youth minister in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is charged with child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches of his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor officiated, said he was deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials indicated that Mr. Hudgins had resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under 18 years of age or access the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being driven out of it
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barred with a swastika was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complaining to the management of the establishment that called the police, said the store Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesperson for the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to rescue her, but "by the time she arrived, he had already left without a break," she added.
I was in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were mouth-to-mouthed.
"You don't go out on the street like this unless you want to get attention," said 60-year-old client Rosina Rusin at Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, Halloween Day, when it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a hoax.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing an SS black armband twice a week for three years at Asda," said Paul Dutton, explaining that I'm suffering from "mental problems."
$325M Lifesaving Plan for the Tasmania Health System
The federal government maintains that the $325 million rescue plan for the vacillating health care system includes strict conditions to ensure that the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking "emergency action" to end a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The funding, planned over 4 years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmania's independent MP, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-emergency surgical operations.
2,600 additional operations, including orthopaedic surgery and cataracts, will help to catch up.
Funding is also provided for non-attendance clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved outpatient care, training of medical professionals, mental health services, and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, this is the best way to treat Tasmania's health care system," said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Tasmania government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The government will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on areas where it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the government provides services in the most efficient and effective manner possible.
Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much "unless it is followed by a real reform to strengthen Tasmania's public health system."
However, he congratulated the government for responding to its request for urgent assistance to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will go a long way towards removing Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional non-emergency procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesperson Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is "a makeshift solution."
"The reason we're here is that the state Labour government has withdrawn $430 million from its health care system," he said on ABC TV.
We can't have a state government ripping out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth putting in $300 million, and pretending it's one of the best days.
Mr Dutton visited Mrs Plibersek to ensure that no dollar in the rescue plan would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts a remarkable artistic direction and a meticulous period reconstruction, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in France in the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebelled, she faced the unbounded cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Mother Superior and became an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pours into lubricity or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons, says the monitoring body
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, said the international chemical weapons monitoring agency on Thursday, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived one day ahead of the deadline.
1 November was set by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or "make unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machines for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial destruction phase is an important step in the ambitious timetable for the destruction of chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is estimated that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made at a time when fighting was raging on Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights based in Great Britain.
The militant group, which is monitoring the evolution of the human balance through a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
It is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces were killed, of whom 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were militants of Lebanese Hezbollah.
Of the deaths, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated this figure since then.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
Al-Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom have been linked to al-Qaeda groups in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not give any details.
The fighting underlined the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they have to complete their mission of ridding Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a continuing civil war within tight deadlines.
A statement by the OPCW, working closely with the UN, stated that its team was "now satisfied with having controlled – and seen destroyed – all declared critical production and machinery for mixing and filling."
She added that "no other inspection activity was planned at this time."
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and...that the elements of the chemical weapons programme they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."
It was not clear at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved by the OPCW Executive Committee the following month.
"I salute the moral strength and courage all of you have shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of al-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that there had been a large explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the sentence imposed on one of the Bali bombers
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence handed down against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a firing squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old was convicted of mass killing for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which resulted in the deaths of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many injuries.
He was also convicted of many other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have requested a life sentence, yet they could have requested that the man, described as "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in bomb manufacturing, be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators almost 10 years ago.
On the brink of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"It should be dragged in front of the firing platoon," Ms. Corteen told the PAA.
I have to live every day without having any other grandchildren, or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He sank into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he "dead" three times while under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues stated that Patek should have known the same fate as the three other members of Jemaah Islamiyah's terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
To spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American forces will kill the former leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in order to re-establish links between the Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaeda.
"He did not surrender," Ms. Corteen added.
Until recently, he made fun of the grief he had caused others.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of crying this year," said Corteen.
Patek, however, can appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their mobile phones – under the much-anticipated new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines will be required to demonstrate to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and have updated crew member training manuals and aircraft storage rules to ensure compliance.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are one of the companies that have already submitted plans.
"Based on the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not expected to re-ignit until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commanding officer gives its green light.
Passengers are assumed to turn off their aircraft when descending the aircraft before landing and not turn them on until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground rolling, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was pleased with these changes.
"Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers to do so – it will benefit everyone," Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room supervisors" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, said the agency.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was evicted loudly from an American Airlines aircraft after refusing to turn off his aircraft while the aircraft was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stowed because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones rests with the Federal Communications Commission and not with the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if they are used on board," said Rosenker.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine the problem recommended last month that the government authorize the wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on its use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there are no valid security reasons for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become pervasive.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their aircraft, or deliberately do so.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand FAA-approved electronic interference.
Airlines have allowed their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only issue minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those who are pushing for a relaxation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's management loaded a line plane of Kindle e-book readers and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has led members of the FAA Advisory Committee to have mixed feelings about whether or not the use of the devices poses a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers stated that he believed the interference from the aircraft was real, although the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA authorize pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling for sensible arrangements for technology-equipped travellers.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not inconsistent with safety," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicopter bird from a platform in the North Sea was released into the wild
A bird, helicopterled after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, was released into the wild.
The water rail was flown aboard a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before it was put back on its feet by the Scottish SPCA in its Alloa rescue centre.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This water rail was probably a winter migrant coming from northern Europe and was caught in the midst of strong winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil rig.
He added: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help."
The water rail was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing companies together and defining what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1 000 entrepreneurs, representing all sizes of companies, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming Europe's institutional arcanes.
When asked about specific policy issues – ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws – the majority of entrepreneurs believe that control over these key competencies should return to Westminster.
The single market has caused general dissatisfaction, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area – 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European ones, even agree.
Finally, and more importantly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based, not policy-based, relationship with the EU.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world is insisting on a "significant change" that restores power to the UK.
The stakes are high – achieving a change in the treaty and better representing Britain's interests would see a 16% shift in votes in favour of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of UK companies, as the euro area is embarking on a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means re-focusing on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in Brussels.
The United States with Halloween colors
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed treats to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States were cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
So this year, the parties caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade in the Greenwich Village area.
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the suit I had planned for last year.
We're having fun like crazy, adds Rhonda.
People are happy.
It's good kid, it's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated on the eve of All Saints, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom declares that Bulgaria's gas pipeline is inaugurating a new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said Gazprom Director.
"A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project," said Alexei Miller, CEO of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout Europe.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas destined for Europe transits, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct junction to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into service in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced Thursday the daily Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, taking over information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory is 47 km2, with three other small islands close by.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the mutinies of Bounty, an episode in the history of the English navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the mutinies of Bounty, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends 95% on the generosity of London.
The Island Council unanimously voted in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, i.e. 836,000 km2, which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would enable the United Kingdom to safeguard the 836,000 km2 provided, however, that it had the means to monitor them, which was not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to surveillance of the area, and there is no port to place military surveillance vessels.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesia ZEE, neighbouring Pitcairn.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese vice-governor
A former vice-governor of Jilin Province, in northeastern China, was sentenced on Friday to life imprisonment for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having hit more than 19 million yuan in bribes, reports the Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Vice-Governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and officials to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared the first interim court in Beijing on his microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, considering that the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the Head of State promised that justice would be as untraceable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were condemned, among them former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest positions in the state.
But the government has not shown any intention of reforming the anti-corruption system, for example by creating an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault as a result of allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two employees of the New South Wales YMCA were charged with sexual assaults against children as a result of allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it "had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization."
Executive Director Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: one YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education instructor from the YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he was aware of the first case but that he was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate, noting, "external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that the safety of children was a top priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst ratings on four establishments during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities carried out in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that personnel management had failed with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they were required to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum sentence of 6 years ' imprisonment.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA had a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failings in the safety of children.
Staff members testified that they had observed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that he kept them in private, that they sat on his lap, that he loved them, and that he allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was under Lord's supervision and who had requested training in child protection because she was concerned about her behaviour, said she found YMCA Caringbah's child services manager Jacqui Barnat, who framed Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General stated that he rejected the staff's testimony that they were reluctant to report these deficiencies to their supervisor.
Instead, he said that their friendly relationship with Lord has clouded their judgment, so they have not reported his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his views before the New South Wales YMCA Council that, for the organization, the lesson learned from "the Jonathan Lord incident" should not involve "reporting" by staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations were raised was made by the Director General of the YMCA for Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that the decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was an “excess of zeal” and that it had been poorly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, i.e. between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on child sexual abuse, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He indicated that there were “serious problems” in the recruitment, monitoring, induction, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but admits that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office, the 59-year-old made his opinion known on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair would have replied, according to London's Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but it may likely happen, so..."
When many equestrian event experts gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old, to win.
Not yet at school and only a few months after having made his first weapons, the toddler and his pony Shetland Toffee trotted during the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – which are of the same size – were praised for the presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition held at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting himself against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side casually to scroll his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his unusual natural qualities of dressage for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good grades for her presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and has since trained with his Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great duet."
They showed up against each other, but both took the gold cut and the rosette.
It was only the second time he was competing with Toffee and we were crazy about the joy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in southern Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Howells said, "There was electricity in the air and everyone was encouraging and applauding it."
He ran all along the track and even though he seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
In the way he started, he will certainly soon be taking part in the Horse of the Year event – and I'm sure he will do a great performance.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee presented well and how they paraded on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really looking great.
A Chinese newspaper that has issued a call "will be redesigned"
A Chinese newspaper that has launched a front-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be revamped, says a press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based New Express issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express is going to undergo a "full overhaul," said the regulator.
The order of "reshuffle" emanates from the Guangdon administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial staff of New Express was disorganized," said the regulator in a statement.
He stated that he had decided "to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card."
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete reshuffle of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the people responsible for New Express and immediately reshuffle the newspaper's management team."
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express on alleged financial irregularities of a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a front-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing fake stories for money.
"In this case, I hurt Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told the CCTV public television network.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express issued his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several important suspects recently made a televised confession.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier this year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is on the run.
The radioactive vapour leak detected on one of Charles de Gaulle's two nuclear boilers, in mid-October and while the vessel was at sea, was "safe for the sailors", but is not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royal has just confirmed to us "the unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, DCNS, a naval defence specialist, assures that its teams and those of Areva, sent to the Var for the occasion, "are currently intervening on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the failed boiler room.
"Every effort is being made to ensure that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013," explains DCNS.
And the National Navy to certify that "it does not in any way call into question the programme of activity of the ship" with nuclear propulsion.
Recall that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier came out of an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had flown from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, with a view to qualifying young pilots as hunters.
A "small damage", confined to the containment space of the reactor, had then occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a great deal of discontent on the part of the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, deluge of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to finish.
In short, limitless siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dilapid dollars could be saved in order to allow a much respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money forcibly taken from taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no problem with the lavish expenses and the maintenance of lame ducks: a loss-making cultural centre, a high subsidy to the Cité de l'Énergie, etc.
If these facilities are unprofitable, sell them to private companies or demolish them.
It is also distressing to see the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come.
However, I give honourable mention to the transformation of the former Wabasso into a sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost for tax payers?
It is not at the public level to invest in such enterprises, but at the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that the lakes to the fishing and the piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water users) and the large decline in the population, water use has declined significantly throughout the territory.
Without meaning to waste it, the city will never run out of water and severe regulations regarding its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a record.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We've been run for over 40 years by ties with mostly fine degrees and I don't think a sheep breeder is doing any worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, was discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 4-foot by 3-foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever seen.
The tunnel, which has a length equivalent to nearly six long football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, USA.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, making it easy to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out by passing unnoticed, said the authorities.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of 10 years to life imprisonment if they are convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate large underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major crossing discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the harvest of marijuana in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels to quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railway tracks that started from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue extradition warrant against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "notice of surrender" against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be liable to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court had invalidated his appeal against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June, asking that South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asks him to appear at a police station, at the date and time of his choice," a spokesperson said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of spying, after having unveiled more than 250,000 American diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting against secret information.
How biometrics will invade our lives
No more passwords to type in to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French and Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Managing Director of Morpho , even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will make it possible to ascertain the identity of a person making transactions in a universe as transverse and transnational as the Internet.
Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this craze for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
In 2011 alone and in France alone, the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the form of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime," said Justin Brookman, who is responsible for consumer privacy at the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometry will be based on new techniques, which will make it possible to provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people who work concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the domain of identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand presuppose a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
It is both a security - we cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out over the last twenty years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the coloured part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased accuracy of the sensors and the computing capacity of the computers needed for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has increased tenfold over the past five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, Director of Accenture's R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today, we are researching voice recognition or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sridhar Iyengar, Director of Security Research at Intel Labs.
A unique and falsifiable marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be regarded as the ultimate biometric data", confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and expensive.
NEC offers the criminal investigation services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in one hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is the one they claim to be).
Identification has so far been concerned with the issue of identity papers: biometrics (fingerprints, photos, iris) must be compared with the information the State has on all citizens already registered.
This ensures that a person does not attempt to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance to a hotel or store.
"We collect the images from surveillance cameras and compare them to the photos of celebrities who circulate freely on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, who is responsible at NEC France for the commercial development of biometric identification solutions.
Other use: take a picture of a quidam who is queued in a store, track his progress thanks to facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens, etc.) or logical access (opening of a computer).
More recently, presence control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend who points for another," explains Cyrille Bataller of Accenture.
But, more and more, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors by introducing his card and placing his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the typing of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and retail outlets: when paying in-store with its credit card, the customer does not type his code, but inserts his finger into a scanner that scans the veins.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Tracks to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in the cashier 30 seconds less, it is appreciable," explains the manager of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
And, finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect the databases.
"The fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure housing, which is blocked if we try to move it," says Philippe Robin, of Thales.
But, for lack of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Privacy experts, on the other hand, continue to be concerned.
"The progress of facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance," predicts Andrew Patrick of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was given a £1,000 almond.
A motorist was fined £1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a warm drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old, from Tiptree in Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to take between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the conduct offence without the necessary prudence and attention.
The seven points removed from his licence led to a six-month licence withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of £90 and a victim surcharge of £100.
A tax on foreign homeowners to blow up the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision by Mr.Osborne who, in Budget 2012, recorded a stamp duty of 7% for properties costing more than £2 million and annual fees for purchasers who choose to own properties in a corporation rather than as an individual.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea Districts, and represents £708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, exceeding the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Cook said: "Following the increase in stamp duty on high value properties and the introduction of anti-avoidance legislation in this area, it is very difficult to argue that high value properties are under-taxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
Prestigious real estate – the 5 to 10 percent of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the thriving southwest London sector stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, grew by a record 11.8 percent over the past year.
Prices in central London show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but have been overshadowed by a growing "internal market", with the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) recovering, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how a dog's tail movements are related to his mood.
Previous studies had shown that happy dogs moved their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs moved them more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "Everyone knows that in man, the left and right sides of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what was going on in other species.
He added that just as in man, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the disordered tail movements of other dogs, researchers followed animals watching movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behaviour.
Surely it won't take long before we understand why their tails sometimes go on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We presented to dogs films featuring other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factor – and we were able to tamper with the movement of the tail and present it as going more to the left or right."
When the animals saw an unexpressed dog moving the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog moving the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail drifting mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog moving the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that dogs deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs know from experience what movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you meet other dogs several times and notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience."
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Canine Behavior John Bradshaw, visiting professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University discovered that the dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "The dogs went more easily to a robot dog when its tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study."
He indicated that the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs involved in the various studies did not consider the animals of the films entirely or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although there is a lot of evidence from different mammals that both sides of the brain are being used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why their tails sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpones concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert to Glasgow after his singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
Sheffield's band was scheduled to perform on Friday in the downtown The Hydro concert hall.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the band was forced to reschedule a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after seeking medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show to Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1st."
"Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the show at the Glasgow Hydro will take place on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest churchmen placed in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer take part in the election of a pope – this therefore amounts to a group of 120 "cardinal voters".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting bringing together all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony at which bishops would be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.
"Pope Francis decided to communicate his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal voters will likely have decreased.
He said that a pope usually appointed as many cardinals as he needed so that the number of cardinal voters would reach 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
Next year's consistory will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will name cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world to examine ways to reform the church.
Previously, the pope decided on his own.
"From now on, François has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "very possible" for Francis to seek advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is totally new.
Valero indicated that the popes generally raised bishops representing vast communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was "full of surprises – so we do not know who he will name".
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair seat backs
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to solve a problem with manually tilting folders, according to a Friday statement by the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a defect in the tilting mechanism.
As a result, the records do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is struck by the rear, the head restraint may not adequately protect passengers, thus increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) site.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the first U.S. car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of pickups of the defect in the first fortnight of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the letter of information to the owners due to the 16-day suspension of government operations, which slowed the growth in vehicle sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM stock prices rose by 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks on Thursday afternoon in Montreal.
The drama occurred around 11:00 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the borough of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations had been going on there for some time.
A adjoining foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the site to retrieve his tools.
I was driving by and saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who remains close to the construction site.
I came in and went to remove the big bricks that were covering it.
You could only see part of his back, it's so unhappy.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his 50s who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation exercises were attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was dispatched to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
The cry of despair of Obama's voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says Obama made laudable efforts thwarted by the obstructionism of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard's Faculty of Medicine.
I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the morosity of the second year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's the memories of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical reports of my patients at night and went to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and newscasters took time to reflect on the historic nature of the moment.
My comrades cried with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries were advancing towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before taking office in 2008, he had 82% favourable views.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic days, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure from Iraq of our army, to the end of the "neither seen nor known" and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the areas of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I'm on the brink of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders, nor the attacks on innocent foreign children by drones.
She cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the misdeeds of the government.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the escape of public funding and the overrun of expenses allowed during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
And, more recently, she cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Of course, the election function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unsophisticated alternative that did not seem to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we had heard about for so long.
Yet, while the favourable opinion index plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He makes me want the many promises that have flown away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton at the Pennsylvania Primary.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
We're five years later, Mr. President, and I don't agree with you anymore.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite rapid rescue action, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, which is challenging the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, argued this in an attempt to rule out issues related to a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be eliminated.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to benefit personally from these policies.
"There will be a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets parental leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the Election Commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr Palmer put forward the idea of reshuffling the counting system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why couldn't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your details into a computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone doesn't agree?
Nowadays, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has explored options for e-voting and has recently published a joint concept paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new duties "very seriously."
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We are not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, scientific mission officer at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Environments (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprise you?
This is good news, but I am not particularly surprised.
If in the past the species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge in the science of species classification.
It is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to call into question the classification or membership of a species in a genus, family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals on the basis of morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are being questioned because of advances in genetics.
Similarly, two closely morphologically related species were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
About a decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species from this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have identified four species.
Why is this an important discovery, as the Wildlife Conservation Society has stated?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability.
Although this population had long been known to researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only there.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region, we might be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than with a local disappearance of a population of a species that is more widespread on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered based on the number of existing individuals on Earth, that is, the stock, and the potential for recovery from nearby stocks.
With respect to the Sousa chinensis species, whose population of the new species was discovered, its stock automatically became smaller, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene mixing limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems favour genetic isolation, which may eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least well known.
We'd rather send robots to Mars than find out what lives in the Mariannes' pit, just 11 kilometres from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent on the search for life on other planets than on marine research, and it is high time it changed.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division according to two sources close to the file, again showing that the regulators' global investigation into suspicions of currency market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in the world's largest financial market investigations, where US$5.3 trillion is changing hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the scandal of manipulations of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
"This case is still under investigation and we are cooperating fully with the CFA and other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file stated that RBS had sent emails and instant messages to and from a former trader to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European currency spot trading manager at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European cash exchange trading manager at Citi, was laid off this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, added sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it had brought an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, stated that it was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
Around the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining allegations about bankers who have agreed to manipulate exchange market rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, reported sources close to the file.
Banks have been peeling instant messages and emails for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
The news about these investigations has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest growth engines of investment bank trading units in recent years, but that has been questioned this year due to low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the large, highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
One senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at little cost".
The news arrived the same day Credit Suisse announced that it had sent a trader working in its London Stock Exchange trading office this week after it caused a $6 million loss at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the business was controlled," said a representative of Credit Suisse.
Mayor Rob Ford's investigation has been sloppy, says lawyer
After police confirmed that they had taken a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby argued that she had never seen an investigation that was so "sloppy".
Mr. Ruby told Canadian Press that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested 35-year-old Rob Ford's friend and occasional driver Alexander Lisi and accused him of extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, pointing out new court documents.
Ruby described as "unexplainable" the fact that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or tapped his phone, arguing that Chief of Police Bill Blair knowingly chose not to take action against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and carried out a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash described Mr. Ruby's remarks as "obvious and desperate attempt" to make himself known to the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
In a press conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" that could lead to the laying of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European stock exchanges down at mid-meeting, except London
With the exception of London, the main European stock exchanges are moving down on Friday mid-meeting, led by some disappointing news from companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
On the other hand, investors remain cautious as they believe that the US Federal Reserve could undo its policy of quantitative easing earlier than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of inflation at 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea spreads among market participants that the European Central Bank (ECB) could relax its monetary policy.
Wall Street's future foreshadows an upward opening of American equities, after two consecutive downturns.
In terms of values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest decline in the CAC 40, led by the result warning of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, having also published downside results this morning and announced the creation in-house of a bad bank with 38 billion pounds of riskiest assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) remained at the top of the EuroFirst300 increases in response to press reports that AT&T was studying a possible takeover.
On the foreign exchange market, speculation on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy is well under way, as demonstrated by John Hardy, Saxo Bank's strategist.
The ECB's single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for the euro to fall.
In this context, the euro continues to fall against the US currency and hit a two-week low in session at $1.3517.
These same assumptions support the euro area bond market.
Supreme Court validates Obama's Health System Reform Act
Obama's administration has won a great victory: the US Supreme Court today declared that Obama's health system reform law was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, on pain of having to pay a fine – and declared it constitutional under the government's taxing power.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page law and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered, on pain of losing all federal funding for the programme, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
Proceedings to block the law were initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates in the 2012 presidential election, including candidate-designate Mitt Romney, were fiercely opposed to the law.
Vibrant tribute to veterans in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid a tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and deceased of all wars.
Sheaves were laid in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by MP-mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Palestinian-Israeli clinging to the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded on Thursday, October 31, 2013, in the evening during a violent clash on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory in the past year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday, 1 November, after the depletion of its fuel stocks, the Energy Authority of the Palestinian enclave announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedin Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another Hamas military-terrorist wing operative, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by tank shell fire during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younes, in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local Al-Qassam Brigade officials, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armoured bulldozer made a 100-metre incursion into the territory before retreating thereafter.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had been killed during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell defending the territory during an incursion by the Zionist occupier in Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," the spokesman threatened.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, for “terrorist activities”.
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers and exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military statement.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive device targeting IDF forces (the Israeli army) and wounded five soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel to attack Israeli civilians," said army spokesman Peter Lerner.
In addition, Israel struck an air military base in north-western Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles for the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah movement, reported on Thursday, 31 October, the satellite channel Al-Arabiya.
An American official confirmed an "Israeli hit" but did not give details of the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he added.
Officials of the Israeli government refused to confirm any information concerning such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that it did not name, the Saudi capital chain reported that "the bombing targeted a shipment of surface-to-air missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", with reference to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting the rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions heard on Wednesday at dawn at an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents Danse Danse with his two new group choreographies: the first inspired by Henri Michaux's inks and poems, the second inspired by Satie's famous piano solos Gymnopedias.
An evening that allows you to see the whole prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and black of ink to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Théâtre Maisonneuve, progresses, profile, fine as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink by Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, simple trait, takes its shape.
And this shape will be that of the whole room: a string of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, entirely dressed in black, only the hands and face discovered, wait on each side of the playground, rush when the next graphy appears, incarnate it, come out running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in relay of solos, in group in unison (a mass that does solo), in large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
One thinks of "Gloire du matin", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, placed online at the forefront.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is strong, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rhythm is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prior takes refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux' poem, monocord and monotonous in the auction, and will continue while dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up deafening and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are a few beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - like those hairs that are rumbling or those black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet the work of Michaux, has established herself, with her tics.
Result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux' inks, like Gestalt's forms, open up an imaginary wider and gibberish than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers chopped by a strobe light and white signs in a suddenly black theatre, touches magic.
The audience liked it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopedias, after the intermission, is richer.
The scene is partly draped with grey, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers take turns playing the scores.
Their clumsiness in music, touching, give a real fragility.
On stage, pass couples, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving ensembles, choirs, writing is less binary.
Buffoons appear, also familiar to Chouinard, with a red nose, in very polarized male-female romantic parades.
Loves are carnastics, runaways or players.
The gestures, the laughter and the little cries beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridiculousness of the bodies into coitus, beings that melt.
But the play takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back on stage when the audience leaves.
There everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the universes explored are superimposed, the dancers rub shoulders, descend among the spectators, gloat, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, spread the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness permeate, and it is Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are being sued for Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents started an avalanche of patent lawsuits Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company he put on the pole during the patent auction that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the United States Assize Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that make it possible to display advertising related to search terms on the Internet, said the outcome of the trial, which is the core business of Google.
It was not possible to reach representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that operate under Google’s Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, finally offering $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google later acquired Motorola Mobility for an amount of $12.5 billion, a market partly based on Motorola's patent library.
"Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at issue during the auction, it violated and continues to violate the patents," the trial concluded.
Rockstar claims greater damages against Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is obstinate, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a defective water heater, said Friday night the deputy prosecutor of the King.
The expert dispatched by the public prosecutor's office ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a build-up of gas.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is still engaged.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and companion, was at his side and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and conditioned at length on site before being taken to the CHU in Liège, she by helicopter, he by ambulance," said Mayor José Paulet, who went down to the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase that remained intact while the rear wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the neighbouring house, weakened by the explosion, were rehoused by the president of the CPAS.
The firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the police of the Arches intervened.
Crisnée's civil protection has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks the first freely elected president to take the oath
Mohamed Morsi took the oath of investiture, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he took the oath of investiture in the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was driven out of power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the Constitutional High Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of State of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before the 18 judges in black robe of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for better tomorrows, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and severely repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to acclaim the new president and, standing out from the presidential fascination of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets linking the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered the Muslim Brotherhood's uncharismatic "back-up wheel," his personal prestige has grown considerably since his victory and Friday speech in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian president Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges present in the room decorated with woodwork where he took the oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he delivered his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by a military band that played the national anthem as he stood guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand...", which thousands of people gathered in the university's grand amphitheatre.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, from where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian regime last year left, and swore to regain the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the former ousted president, dispossessed him.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Morsi's speech at Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
Shutdown in the USA has curbed the rise in the automotive market
The 16-day closure of most federal administrations weighed on the growth in car sales in the United States in October, showing the figures released Friday by the manufacturers, five of the top six having performed below expectations.
Detroit's three major manufacturers are showing double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors has done better than expected.
Analysts predicted an average of 15.4 million sales on an annualized and seasonally adjusted basis, but the market was estimated to be 15.3 million according to Morgan Stanley's analyst Adam Jonas.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight brake is explained in the first place by "the government's 'shutdown' and its impact on the consumer's feeling during the first half of the month".
GM nevertheless reported an increase of almost 16% in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands have seen their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit, among other things, from the success of its pick-ups, saw its sales increase by 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus awaited 194,301.
For its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in its sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also have lower-consensus sales, despite year-over-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.

Renault Leaded on the Stock Exchange by Nissan's Warning
On Friday, Renault recorded the biggest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced that it had reduced its annual net profit forecast by almost 20%, traders report.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a review, also announced a reshuffle of its management.
Several traders reported that the Renault action was affected this morning by the "warning".
"It's clearly Nissan's profit warning," says a trader from a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to Nissan's website data.
Greece: Two dead in shooting near neo-Nazi party premises
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night by shots fired by two people who were on a motorcycle passing in front of a building of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party in the western suburbs of Athens, police sources reported.
The police were not in a position at the moment to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had claimed that the victims were guards from their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police from the anti-terrorist service rushed to the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio suburb, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident occurred a few weeks after the indictment of six deputies from Golden Dawn, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in "a criminal organization" as part of an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal dismissed
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for the next two matches of Champions League of his club, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Deported against Barça for sending a blow to Neymar, the Scottish community saw its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed", considering that his appeal was entirely justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes are without electricity throughout the province shortly after noon on Friday, due to strong winds in many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The sectors most affected are the Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the dark, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The greater Montreal area also has its share of outages with nearly 7,000 private power homes in the metropolitan area and Laval.
You thought travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be reversing the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecasts upwards and hopes for record results thanks to vacationers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects to realize an underlying profit for the entire fiscal year between $325 million and $340 million before taxes, compared to a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If the current forecast is met, this will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in 2011/12.
Director General Graham Turner stated that Flight Centre had made 8 per cent of profits in the first half of the year and that the second half of the year had started in strength, particularly with respect to non-business travel to Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present have been profitable, and several of them are on track to achieve record results for the entire fiscal year before deducting interest and taxes," he said.
This applies to Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the largest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half of the year, compensating for a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure travel industry has performed well while business customers have spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses in the first half of the year when seasonal demand was lower and was expected to profit for the third time in a row.
Flight Centre stock increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknowns fire at hotel near Cairo pyramids
Unknown coverts opened fire this Friday on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without causing any casualties, as a result of an apparent quarrel with dismissed employees.
The attackers fled, said the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, police general Abdel Latif.
This attack comes at a time when Egypt has received almost no tourist since the army removed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and bloodsheded its supporters' protests.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English literature classes, students will have to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also introduce "new texts" to encourage a more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
Starting in 2015, students will have to pass an independent GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish tomorrow its new English and math programs – the raw materials to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other fundamental matters next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Board of Examiners, will unveil a redesign of the GCSE structure, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking over the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was "a broad consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence," stressing that the GCSE would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and students in Singapore do about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government indicated that the in-depth math GCSE – as well as the greater emphasis on subjects in international rankings – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of instruction.
The program will place greater emphasis on "real world problems", including financial mathematics.
This ruling means that a law adopted in July in that State and largely calling into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An octogenarian welcomes children with a rifle at Muy for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 went door-to-door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy neighbourhood visited by the children opened the door by holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old explained to the gendarmes that he had been afraid.
His gun's been seized.
Former head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without his trace ever being found, was in fact buried in a mass grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte," he assured the daily wide circulation on the basis of archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, would answer one of the great enigmas of the Postwar era.
The German secret service, the BND, was responsible for ensuring that during the summer of 1949 Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were totally wrong.
"From August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando," Tuchel said.
He was wearing "a general's uniform."
"In the left inner pocket were his service records with a photo," he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from the district hall of the district of Mitte in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The president of the Central Council of Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, expressed shock at this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormity of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is grossly trampled with their feet," he insurgated in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

It walks in mud, jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroonian villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect him "CNN Heroes of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his or her extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of conscience and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a haematoma that he would carry with him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could get.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, walk to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
By way of comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians would not be able to pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the country's health expenditure is in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," said Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his fellow countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed over 700 free surgical procedures over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaoundé.
And it has established a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas during weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about 30 people, they pile up in vans after fixing the medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to reach the villages most in need of help.
Luck doesn't always follow them.
They have had to push the vehicles many times to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodations available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to party, and Dr.Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began receiving hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people each time we visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
Sometimes they live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this travelling hospital, various health care services are provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical procedures under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, town hall or house; after the procedure, the patient gets up and goes to the wake-up room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of equipment, Dr.Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's an exhausting rhythm, but village musicians usually help the team stay motivated.
"They hit drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working," said Mr. Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgical procedures free of charge over the past year, and knows that their presence can make all the difference for those they help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"It will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to supporting this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr.Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, that finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer with Dr. Bwelle's group.
He's still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr.Bwelle in his missions, this is a field learning opportunity they don't have at home.
"We were able to take part in operations to help wipe the blood or get Dr. Bwelle through the instruments," said Ms. O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in the second year.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transportation and teaching were taken over by Dr Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not close to extinction.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," said Mr. Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons why I do this.

Pierre Nora's two Frances
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Professor in the amphitheaters and classrooms?
Undoubtedly, but emphasizing its weakness for the crossroads, Sciences-Po, Hautes Etudes.
Arbitrator of the works of others in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the editor.
Heir to the armchair that Fontenelle occupied at the Académie française?
Certainly still, but knowing that such a sacre cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, of which it happened.
They readily recognized in him a great awakener, animator and unifying of their work, but by pointing out that he was not inclined to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked tongues could see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, endowed with a keen glance and weight of scholarship, but incurably dilettante.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the one who passed for not to write had much and well written.
The book here should definitely do him justice.
Yet, once again, there is the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagrancy, jubilation set to jump as if with feet joined from one subject to another.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the brochanteur back to one and the same passion: to discover the constitutive knot of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: this is a concern of the time.
In short, we have been collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our then leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora's tracking is quite different.
He does not pose as heir of an eternal francity, he refuses to the definition.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders in a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the form of a rebus, tormented by irritating questions.
Of which this one, which is born of the enterprise itself: why, in a country so long-term installed within its borders, so formerly built and solidly masonry, do we hear these dramatic calls for unity?
They are so pressing, Pierre Nora suggests, only to ward off the trouble born of the discords of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one that divides national history into two.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchic, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without succeeding in denying it; on the contrary, anxious to regain its sacrality and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility because it had cut off the head to the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And, from there, an invinciblely binary nation, shared between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps outside of the Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora's American escapade might well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a bill of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But the American cousinship only makes it even better to emphasize what is our own.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, congested men of an ancient indigenous regime, and all the more radical.
There a consensual revolution when here it sowed drama and confit.
Here are the founding fathers who are always honored, and here are the revolutionary ancestors who are struggling to make models, and who have, moreover, been killed.
Here an institutional consistency, and here a cascade of constitutions, as many errors to catch up and attempts to resume.
France is leaving, France is coming
Yet there was a time when the French thought they could sew the torn dress of their history, and overcome the curse of number two.
At this third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed a great deal of interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything that in ancient France obscured modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But that pacified identity only had a time.
Here it is again in debate, shaken by a new kind of immigration, threatened by the rise of protestant minorities, absorbed in the European area.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France that goes away and the circumspect sketch of France that comes.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve a few surprises.
We discover that the chemineau was a casanier.
The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The edge walker was in the centre of the centre.
And he who had tabled, more than half a century ago, a subject on the idea of a nation, but had escaped from the initiatory exercise of the thesis, confided to us, cum grano salis, that he would eventually have done it.
Certainly in a less stiff form, more exploded and more subtle.
But let us not be mistaken, just as binding.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis speaks of the inner necessity of a life.
Former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is quite complex to manage"
The journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was kidnapped in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his team of "Antenne 2" who came to film a Hezbollah demonstration and was released almost 21 months later on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the hostage defence association "Otages du monde", which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the possibility for hostages to lodge complaints and bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
In detention for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, little by little, to resume their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" asked 62-year-old Jean-Louis Normandin, former major reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages du monde".
By the night of your release, you were on the 8 p.m. set of "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
On site, in Beirut.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's dark - Roger Auque.
He says, "We're freed," but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but we're very tense too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They're dropping us off on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the Summerland Hotel site where the press is present.
Frenchmen take us to the French embassy.
It's time for the first calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And dined in t-shirts at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night talking to Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arrived there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How did your arrival take place on French soil?
We're landing in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible rush.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three television channels.
I'll be back and there's plenty of them.
The descent of the flight staircase, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers pull themselves together to take pictures and follow me to my home where I have to do some police to stop some of them from climbing.
The media pressure is huge.
It doesn't stop, we're in a good position to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We come out of a hole and we're suddenly in the middle of the media.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to manage.
But we did the hardest.
That same night, I'm at 8:00, and the next day, I'm on TV.
Then begins some sort of life rehabilitation, very slowly, for one or two months that are a bit like a vacation.
How were the medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing?
I had a first medical check in Corsica.
The rest was done in the Val-de-Grâce on the following days: radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can count on him, remind him if need be, that we are not left to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostage takers.
That made sense.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages in Niger?
I'm listening to what I'm saying.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things piss me off, others less.
I try to share things between the questions about my past as a hostage and my hat as president of the association "Otages of the World" which allows me to distance myself, and I seem much more interesting to discuss.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, with others, for recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
There is, in my opinion, a semantic problem.
Hostage-taking must be described as "political" - which is most often the case - and hostages must be given access to justice, the opportunity to complain and to bring their hostage-takers to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages may also have access to justice?
That's what a court in The Hague is for.
Why don't we say to the hostage-takers "you've flouted the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva Conventions, we're going to bring you to justice"?
It seems to me, however, well founded, legitimate and sensuous.
This message is heard, but not listened to, and it shockes me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger is raging among the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of deposed President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the re-establishment of the country's first democratically elected president.
It's not a trial that highlights this Muslim Brotherhood activist.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a joke.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial. He's the one who's supposed to try Sisi, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed outside the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses 9 US states of violating homosexual rights
Since the federal government recognized homosexual marriage, "all military spouses have the right to an identity card from the Department of Defense and the benefits that come with it," the minister recalled in New York in a speech before the Anti-Defamation League to fight anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities," he denounced, accusing them of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided at these bases, or access their shops.
The Secretary of Defence said that he had ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The frond of the nine states began with Texas, which refuses to implement these services on the facilities of the Texas National Guard, due to a conflict between the Texas law and the federal law on homosexual marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of homosexual marriage to be about 5600 active persons, 17,000 including the National Guard, the reserve and pensioners.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place on Saturday, November 2nd at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump association, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are taken on site Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualification phases will start at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled for 3 p.m. and the award ceremony at 4 p.m.
The audience will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend the competitions at the highest level, like the young hyerois prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years old, he has already won his place this year for the European championships in Copenhagen and he likes nothing so much as to watch over competitors who exceed him by three heads.
Mayor of Toronto hunts journalists to question him about a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drugs, according to several media reports.
A video retrievable seems to support these suspicions.
The interested person, Rob Ford, has always denied that he used crack, while acknowledging that he has a preference for cannabis.
This Thursday, he chased several journalists from his property to interview him.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in Val-d'Oise, obviously of foreign origin, while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Institut Pasteur.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and take care of those who could have come into contact with this kitten between 8 October and 28 October," the ministries of health and agriculture said.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"In man, the preventive treatment of human rabies, given after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the press release says.
The ministries now call on people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or skin damaged by this kitten or whose animal has been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"France being free of rabies since 2001, this kitten or the mother have been imported from another country, not free", according to the press release.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "Aboriginal" case of rabies recorded was in December 1998 on a fox and that "France was officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a bitch illegally imported from Gambia had been recorded in 2008.
"Rage is a fatal disease if it is not treated in time," the ministries recall, and it is transmissible for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama reverses its reform of the health system
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that "if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received termination notices from their claimants, Republicans have criticized the president over the past few days by accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "a buzz in the news" about terminations, President Obama urged the Americans who received these notices to look for new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better-adapted health plans for the same price, or even for even less than expected.
"You'll win," he said.
The Authority has announced that it is not surprising that the 5% of the population who are self-employed are forced to change their plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius in her testimony before the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had failed "unfortunately."
"I'm as frustrated and irritated as anyone," she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this phrase, when she believed her microphone cut, by speaking to an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday's Assembly session following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, the Republican representative of Missouri, to see if she should join the Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long insisted on asking Mrs.Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel has a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky rider, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colours of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the level of the track.
Germany's Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula One World Champion, staged a special helmet for free practice at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday, designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen among 1,500 drawings sent from all over the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, an automobile brand, of its team.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and can see the German champion closely, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday at the test.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet Sunday, for the race, to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Suburban Party
Let's not get this wrong.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Suburban Party" is not only aimed at the suburbs.
I have chosen a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of suburbs, I speak to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
Nevertheless, his project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his native commune of Aubervilliers, was born from the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes the neighborhoods.
My first proposal is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attaché, claims today to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are linked to the left, but if the people on the right are ready to support me, I will listen to them too, he continues.
Only extremist parties I don't talk to.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program -consultable on the Internet - on the basis of many themes supposed to speak to the inhabitants of the suburbs and in particular to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years old, the rehabilitation of the function of housekeeper...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, it risks being fair," he admits.
It's a matter of time and money.
The Suburban Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune claims to already have seven lists in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails I have received since yesterday don't all come from the suburbs," he rejoices.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that American espionage "had gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry pointed to a softening of the defensive attitude of the United States towards its surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions espionage "had gone too far inappropriately."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had ruled on "autopilot" when a series of incendiary revelations about NSA spying by whistleblower Edward Snowden emerged.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have learned of certain things in autopilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War to the difficult years of the Cold War, and then of course on 11 September."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had gone beyond limits, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far inappropriately."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make it clear to people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels mistaken.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr. Kerry stressed, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up."
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We did prevent planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged US spying case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counter-terrorism efforts with the US, said Thursday the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut indicated that he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had made to a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration with the National Security Agency's surveillance.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain at our side in the mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and Chairman of the Sub-Committee on European Affairs of the United States Senate, in an interview from Washington.
And I am going to go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with some of the US allies, but the agency's director said this week that this was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the US.
Other revelations referred to documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other Heads of State.
The Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified the spying of the allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a congressional trip, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was not only to improve relationships, but also to show "felt firmness."
He explained that European heads of state should be honest with their citizens about the kind of spying programs they have been implementing themselves for years.
"We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only people in the world who do spying," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry has planned to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the resentment generated by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by United States surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, led by Shell's poor performance and in the aftermath of an announcement by the Fed that it would continue to support the economy as planned.
Australian woman appeals her sentence of imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident of Sydney, sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Province Court on June 15 of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket's police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to inventing the story of everything.
She was detained in a cell at the local police station before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who appealed to Canberra's Foreign Department to help his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
"Of course, we have had a very distressing time, but we hope to get her home safely as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after a 50,000 baht bail.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer from Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years' imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to restore her damaged image among tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
French police will arrest Anderlecht's supporters who have come other than with the RSCA buses
The French police decided to set strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club d'Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain scheduled Tuesday, communicated Marie Verbeke, spokesperson for the Brussels-midi police area, Friday.
The Belgian supporters of the RSCA who want to go to this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former border post in Rekem to the PSG stadium," the spokesman said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had an intention to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has indicated that measures have been taken to make arrests or even police custody," said Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
A year ago, this prompted a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff to consider how to better integrate students who live on horseback between different cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Living Together in French".
Vision diversité has been walking around schools for a year to help students of all origins discover common landmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Big names of writers, artists, whether they're ethnic or they've come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"So we create projects so that they identify with all of this," explains Vision Diversity President Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne of the Institut du Nouveau Monde identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the feeling of belonging, the support of staff in the transformations we are experiencing, within the student clientele," he lists.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board has created a research centre that will give tools to teachers who, at times, come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz of the Université de Montréal will be its Scientific Director.
Preparing to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"Different educational strategies are the real need," she sums up.
Research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistic, academic, social and cultural.
