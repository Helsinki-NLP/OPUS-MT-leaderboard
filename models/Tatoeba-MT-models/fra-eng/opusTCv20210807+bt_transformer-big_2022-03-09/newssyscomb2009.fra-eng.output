Right-wing populists triumph in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
Preliminary results show that the early parliamentary elections in Austria resulted in a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current Grand Coalition, as well as a notable strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party, where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly large losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria, the governor of Carinthia, Jirg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SP) remain, with 29.8 percent of the vote, the leading political force in the country, however, compared with the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the vote.
The OVP, who with 25.6 percent lost nearly nine percent of the vote, ended up even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the popular party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Still in early July, when the PVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead over the SP.
Voters obviously punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations were made about the possible resignation of the party leader and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday, during the extraordinary council of the leadership of the party.
Such a move would a priori facilitate the path to the outcome of the election result, which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the SP and VP grand coalition.
Nevertheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free (FP) would have obtained 18 percent and BZ - 11 percent of the votes - the Socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FP was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZ - separated from the European Union) on a common government, which was part of the sanctions.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he plans to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently relies on this development.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
Obviously, no other party crossed the four percent limit and entered parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India at risk of cooling
If the problem of the accused Czech researchers in India, accused of illegal collection of cockroaches, could not be solved, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations would follow.
The minister declared it today in New York, after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he said after the meeting, which was held following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, on leaving the talks, that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial cases.
He mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr Ovecha, who was relieved of the charge and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the latter.
“His problem could be solved,” the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kusera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could apply for bail and wait for the judgment at liberty, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also spoke in the same direction during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted persons with “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance was already being provided to them by India.
Above all, we want to maintain the best relations with India, which have a tradition that continues over many years.
The Indians also recognize it,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said to TK, he pointed out to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
“We consider the incarceration and accusation of these Czech researchers to be a great misunderstanding,” he said.
The minister ducked the question if he got a promise from India to deal with the matter.
“I’ve already received quite a few promises,” he only noted.
A Czech referee the fight for the seabed
It is approaching a wall-mounted electronic map, on which is represented Australia and adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
This area is however as large as the continent itself,” says Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of thirty members of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the director of the division, the Czech jurist Vaclav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
The ardour at work and the enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world little known until now, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found there, but also unknown living organisms, which may hold the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A background larger than the land
Coastal states have now begun to aspire vehemently to the new submarine territories.
According to a UN convention, they use their rights, which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
The latter can, according to the convention, claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, is considered continental shelf the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the littoral sea, often also beyond the 200 nautical miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic yone,” says Mikulka.
The request of the country in question to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a large scientific-technical documentation, based on many expensive prospecting and meticulousness.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the commission has dealt with five requests, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful,” Mikulka added.
The success of Australia, which is the first to have significantly expanded its underwater possessions, has recently had a worldwide impact.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which the commission attributed to it last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometres, which is the country's six-fold increase.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in exploration.
The benefit they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they project themselves, be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, submit their applications.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
“Nevertheless, make no mistake, the seabed is not a Klondike,” said director Mikulka, adding that “its areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract.”
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, under the terms of the Convention, it was granted, along with investors from a few other States, the status of a so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area surveyed by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is hectic, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” enumerates Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurist.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a concretion.
It recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on hand for the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had sought Germany’s help in resolving the hostage crisis – the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready but they never took action.
More and more details about the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are being revealed.
According to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces also indirectly participated in the rescue operation.
Thus, both specialists from the Federal Army and officials from GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Flight and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technischen Hilfwerk, were at the scene of the liberation.
As the Ministry spokesman reported on Monday evening, German forces were ultimately not required, as the hostage-takers freed their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government would have accepted the assistance offered by Germany to integrate it on the spot as a support force.
"Fortunately, this has not happened so far," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers had kidnapped in southern Egypt the group of tourists composed of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transferred to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers has remained vague until now, as have the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the time being, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five holidaymakers and the special forces should have taken off aboard an Airbus of the air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Plan
The first house of Congress narrowly defeated the $700 billion bailout of the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout in favor of the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of US President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that had to contain the chaos of the financial markets did not get a majority.
In a dramatic move, the parties had desperately tried to convince opponents of the merits of this hefty $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called for a favorable vote although the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to have political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote, the Dow fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was investors’ concern that the state bailout could fail.
He went back shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fell again.
Experts are now projecting further severe turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, approval from both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate is required.
Organizers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months according to a study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the thirst for travel of Germans remains insatiable according to this study.
With regard to bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 percent compared to the same period the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin.
According to the survey of the Research Institute of Markets GfK, increasing numbers of reservations already dominate the autumn months.
Thus the sales figure would have risen to about 11 percent compared to 2007, confided the DRV.
The sources of these results are figures from the GfK, which analyzes monthly booking data from 1,200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low dollar price, travel to the US would be particularly in demand, the DRV said.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
Besides this, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be particularly sought after destinations by the Germans.
Specially organized trips are in high demand, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs here would be “more easily calculated for the customer than for an individually organized trip”.
Consumers can save money, among other things, with early booking discounts or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been very restrained so much so that an increase in sales figures will again be recorded compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
Ballermann or Apres-Ski hits continuously, beer in pitchers per litre and celebrities in designer Tyrolean costumes.
An event at the beer festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't actually have much in common.
She is blonde, a TV host and wears a tailor-made Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers jump on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and that on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to achieve its goal.
As a beer-festival tourist and normally living north of the Equator of the Weiswurst, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was until now limited.
But once on the Place Thérèse, everything is half as bad.
Everyone or almost everyone wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; no one looks jaded or shamed - this is completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean costume gets a few weird eye shots at the banana-shock stand.
A Bavarian woman pointed out to me that I would have badly tied my apron: "on the left means free, in the middle virgin, on the right case, in the back widow."
Discreetly, I tripatoize my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she said and laughed.
Others do not go to such lengths for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes us their naked hindquarters without being invited.
The young man with an exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, who arrives from England and comes for the first time to the beer festival.
He thinks it's "gorgeous," with an elongated "oooo."
He tells me all about it after he's relieved himself of the mug he's been drinking before.
Directly next to this fire hydrant that everyone thinks is a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wild peeps".
Others do not have the chance to get rid of alcohol this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, rhymes of rescuers run to the place of the feast and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses intervene rather in packs - always by four, they drag their stretcher covered with tents in tents.
It works this way for most visitors to the beer festival: we go empty, we come back full.
Those who lie in the coffin of the stuffed under the tarp are not visible.
“They are the ones who can’t swallow anything anymore,” one of the rescuers yells in response to my question and then disappears into the fray.
Accident victim identified by police
A 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon crash in town on Shenfield Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate its hinterland.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps from Asia, is one of the finest relics of his fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-Renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that’s what the guides tell us.
The monument is located on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation towers at each of its angles, like some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we no longer have any doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, backward in the game of imperialism, wanted to achieve its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding area, brought about by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and Empire forces advanced against Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say this is sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, engulfed in the meanders of history.
But today, the rail crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serves to highlight Turkey’s expanding diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding area, brought about by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a sleeper car in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish MP AKP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a journey of 10 and a half hours, shaken on noisy rails whose cadence recalled the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived, in the Turkish capital – presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning its back on its German past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure, expressly built of stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and by many pastries in which middle managers in suit-tie-men and women- meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
“The aim of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for both of them.
She had to do both.
"But then, at some point, I asked if 'shouldn't Turkey choose?'"
“Turkey,” he said, “doesn’t want to have to choose between the two.”
He then pointed out an aspect that almost everyone I spoke to recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway goes not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleep, I thought of these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period when Turkey had been called "the sick man of Europe".
At least, there is no longer any doubt on the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Musical director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the fantastic youth choir Proteus the following year.
The choir was supposed to include the under-21s, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to handle any type of music was presented to it, whether madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod used to tell us to “let the music speak for itself.”
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It’s all there, in the music.
So sing!"
His wand technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver were to be named a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I’ve seen over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me – and, sometimes, they even inspired me.
Tod Handley held such a rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, “only focus on certain people.”
He will be missed by many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (died 25 September) states that "in 1946 he had resumed his studies in economic history, at Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD".
This is from the letter of the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastics industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Hoblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'The Flamenco and Life' because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have attracted my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second assault on Honda's super sales
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had good habitability, this new monovolume has an even more ample interior space.
Added to this are some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz presents a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are many.
Among them is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before looking at the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation was put on the market.
First of all we see that Honda has renovated this model in a shorter time than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case of Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it plans to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% growth in sales in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s sales in Spain.
Officials of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely compensate for the decline in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the managers of the brand hope to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars i.e. 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease in sales of 16%.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to achieve a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid with a compact size - 4.37 meters in length - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be split between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, following its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters which represents an increase of five centimeters.
However, the height does not change to 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and so does the interior space.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a fuel reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the capacity of the trunk – which has a double bottom system – can hold up to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity compared to the trunk of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation - in addition to exterior elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof - is the improved access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of the Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two gasoline thrusters of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines feature i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, making the engine more powerful and increasing the engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine develops a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This thruster - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous thruster, which on the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now reaches 100 horsepower.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The ‘bee car’ that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center made this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan Safety Shield.
This robot will allow the brand’s vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space in an oval shape that closely resembles the Nissan safety shield.
But most important are the bee’s compound eyes, capable of seeing in an angle of over 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly continuously inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers developed what is called a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles that are within a distance of two meters and a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"The moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bifurcating its wheels by 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Displacement Laboratory and principal engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down, nor diagonally; it can move only in two dimensions and according to what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a function of rotation, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
"Every second this device must only process information and act on that data.
It doesn’t need to retain the information or intuitive logic of prior maneuvers, which is why it can run continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
It may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.”
This represents the first car to develop new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced in production cars in a decade or so after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the road.
They are afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be recognized that the Treasury of the United States, in addition to having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without geniuses.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from getting into mortgages with credit banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is to say 'the Hotel of bad credits' ... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Maitre d'Hôtel leads us to think several times if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it.
Of course, this game gives useful but not very detailed information.
It’s more of a game for teenagers.
What to do if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will pay $9 billion to take 21% of its capital, a news welcomed by a sharp decline in its share price.
A week after unveiling an interim deal, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9 percent of Morgan Stanley common shares at a unit price of $25.25, or a total amount of $3 billion.
The price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall deal would be based on an average unit price of $29, or 28 percent above its current price.
Morgan Stanley, however, lost 6.79% at $23.07 around 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to bank holding status,” said John Mack, chief executive of Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but puts it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday further show that the deal has been changed in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG’s executive director, told Tokyo, “we thought the stake would be entirely made up of common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of earnings per share.
Under the agreement, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares within a year if they trade more than 50% above the conversion price, or around $47, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley says the capital provided by MUFG will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase liquidity.
A spokesperson for the group declined to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to post a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had “clearly” cut its balance sheet since late August.
The past few weeks have been challenging for the group, which has seen its stock price halve as the cost of insurance against a risk of default on its debt soared.
This cost was falling on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Rebuilding the Republic around 21st Century Socialism.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, it is the third who put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results of 80% of the vote.
According to these results, the "no" vote received 28%, 7% of the votes were void and 0.7% were white votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to get half the vote plus one.
On Sunday, two polls taken at the exit of the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a large victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed in the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The “Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly,” he said, congratulating Ecuadorians at the headquarters of Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chavez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place in calm according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was about a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, reserving for it the "development planning" of a country living mainly from oil extraction by foreign companies and currencies sent by its emigrants.
Carried out by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, who will be able to serve up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
All 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando has launched the assault against the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought safely to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived at around 3:30 p.m. on a special plane at al-Maza military base, adjoining Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, aboard helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examination.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers, said on the tarmac the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna.
Captured on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one cache to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous agency, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, carried on board two helicopters, launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of gunfire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fleeing," said the official, who requested anonymity.
He said that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "flash" unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
“We have to recognize that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and efficiency of our secret service men, special forces,” he said, without elaborating.
He also denied paying a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol a 4x4 vehicle in which the kidnappers were on board, killing in six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army claimed they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and occupying this election campaign.
Good.
But one area of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the amounts of misery that are granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are starving?
What politician will dare remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is devoting three and a half million euros to the restoration of the only Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and this, in concertation.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 history, heritage, archives and genealogy societies are concerned with excavating history, preserving with three sous mounds of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when developers and decision-makers throw their bulldozers at our forgotten old stones and cemeteries.
When, a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalise part of Fortis bank
The Benelux countries help the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalizing it. The three countries support, to the tune of 11.2 billion euros, this financial and insurance institution also having interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also appealing to the European Central Bank and the head of competition of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has been growing for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank, and from a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In line with the decision made on Sunday night, the three states will buy back nearly half (49%) of the bank’s capital in each of the countries.
The bank will, without a doubt, sell part of its holdings, among which, in the first place, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch organization ABN Amro.
In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to be allowed to go bankrupt.
On Friday alone, the company's shares fell 12 percent to their lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group’s capital is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company’s executives, is not realistic.
The company’s management blames the uncertainty from across the Atlantic, in connection with the adoption of the $700 billion US bailout, for the fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new chief executive.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they were not going to lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank’s customer circle and no agency was stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information regarding his drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market is spiraling out of control.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of information about the prescription of drugs, in any case, to the consent of the data subject.
This kind of program has to be in independent hands, otherwise it's like entrusting your chicken coop to a fox" - Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescription drugs, told the Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and the insured capital in case of damage, on the state of health of the client who presents, and if they believe that the risk is too great, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent the candidates for a medical examination, and they only signed an insurance contract with them after learning the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he easily obtains from pharmacies, the data concerning the purchases of drugs of the person in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, which disease the person suffers from and what is his state of health.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, it refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts him in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some determine at the same time a risk coefficient, so there is not much left to do to the insurer except paperwork. However, tiny problems can still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used for migraine or hot flashes, but can also be effective for depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data, they must ask the patient's permission before collecting necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their failures in the past.
Recently, some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them with data on drug use, so they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and at the same time control of use is becoming more and more difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill to expand the circle of control of the authorities over companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he developed his program even further, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the data subject.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his consent or not, since if he refuses, the insurance companies do not sign an insurance contract with him.
Thus and ultimately, the hens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other, largely global, problems.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit, where the focus will be on cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is a great emerging democratic power that should be given a broader voice in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to agree on their support for New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not dwell too much on this question yesterday, at this 9th summit held in Marseilles.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years, they would double trade, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be too ambitious a goal.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights, so that air trade can also take off in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, the EU's largest trading partner, on the one hand, and New Delhi, the ninth largest trading partner of the EU, on the other.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan had been strongly condemned, as had all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on that subject had been raised.
The completion of the Doha trade round has also been called for, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains committed to the energy and climate agenda, including that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic materials by at least 20 percent until 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as on the need for a global market at next year’s climate conference, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent until 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported convening an international working meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is now traveling to the French capital, where during a bilateral meeting, he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth twenty billion euros for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the information of the news agency, the agreement would cover 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles in exhibition, and Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Under Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, during the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: indeed, Italy will be present institutionally, with an Italy Point- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the press meeting in the Room Struktur, at Butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospectives on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors' books gradually decreases compared to the total Italian production, and in particular, compared to that for adults and children.
Found the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris was found on a plateau at 3,000 meters above sea level in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson dismissed the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared," he said at a news conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found on the plane or in the vicinity.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported that hours after the wreckage was located, a team of investigators sent to the scene identified the aircraft: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset’s personal belongings were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was halted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
By the sixth attempt, in 2002, he had become the first man to complete the round-the-world flight on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had traveled around the world by plane and non-stop.
Among all these records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters in height, on the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect.
An unusual 4x4 with an original and well-defined design, marked lines, large surfaces and sharp angles.
Here, in summary, Glk, the latest born of the "compact" off-road of the house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
Precisely because of its exceptional content, unexpected and unconventional will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from October 17th.
Thus the hype that will accompany the beginning of the new car will give rise to a new way of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication involves the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, we will have the impression that by looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertisement, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of motorist communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future acquirers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the group "Ultra Italy" that has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created big problems.
Nor had he ever clashed with the opposing tifosis.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia were added small groups (little in reality) from Campania and Puglia.
They had tricolor flags on which appeared their city of origin: Saturday night, they were all removed to not be identified.
They are inspired by English tifoserie.
In Bulgaria, they found a tifosis of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian tifosi, 144 tickets for the game: all nominal, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had indeed controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian tifosi who had a history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the deeds that will come from the Bulgarian police, and then will take action: in this case, it could be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the disorder are serving a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that forbids to go to Italian stadiums, but also European ones.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot in the stadium.
Fortunately.
But now is the time of fear-emulation: that is to say, others risk being added to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize who is behaving in this way," the Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes open especially in view of Wednesday's national team match in Lecce"
In Puglia there is indeed a small nucleus of supporters of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is to say the secret services, which deal with precisely the problems of stage.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce, and the arm extended during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria, it is not a crime"
This is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the post of Francesco Tagliante and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste where a core of supporters of the group Ultras Italy, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, praising Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 tifosis was shameful.
“I am not a sociologist,” adds the Observatory’s No. 1, “crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had remained within the rules, now we will see what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to Mameli’s anthem: these too are not crimes, but if you allow me, they are not polite.
