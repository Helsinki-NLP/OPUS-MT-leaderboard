Parliament did not ratify Tymosenko's release amendment
The Ukrainian parliament has refused, as part of an amendment to the criminal law, the plan to cancel the paragraph relating to the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the opposition leader.
The deputies refused at second reading the draft amendment aimed at reducing the penalties for economic offenses, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having reached a seemingly disadvantageous deal with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must rule on the convicted woman's appeal in December.
Tymosenko calls the ruling a political revenge of the regime and has caused a process of suspicions of court bias also in the west.
The plan to annul paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victory
Libya’s liberation or rebellion already has its vanquished.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners have yet to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are Islamists, but are they moderates or radicals?
The Provisional National Council has decreed the usual law of Sharia and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a robbery we cut off our hand.
Women can forget emancipation, the possible non-respecters of the faith are liable to the death penalty...
It is the Qur'an that will unite in the place of the dictator's personality the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya such an order will reign as we cannot imagine it and as we would surely not like it.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be advantageous for Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors have accepted help with gratitude from infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who directed the NATO strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated with each attack.
When it comes to finding the victors in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam and our politicians turned away from the dictator as a political ally without this bringing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
So there is no problem for the locals to get rid of the "crossed".
Without land use, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of a protection of the interested of human rights.
As long as we prevent these followers of sharia.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the sights of investors.
A tornado of statistics was spent Tuesday on Europe.
Each of the states has published the GDP reltive information for the 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are not only looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries published earlier their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is forecast to grow by 0.5%, while France's is forecast to grow by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany performed better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), however France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (there was talk of stagnation at the origin).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that there is a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated in the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, according to forecast and periodically recalculated data.
The euro area and European Union economy grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is what analysts had expected.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
The yield on 10-year bonds is 28.45%
Bond yields in Spain and Italy are climbing to critical limits.
The problems are starting to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Czech bond yields remain below 4% as the situation worsens in the region.
There are voices in Germany that the ECB should be the guarantee of last instance .
The Czechs have qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate qualifying for 200 million
The representation of football has achieved its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to super Cech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has defended with a lot of luck in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a big share of luck for the second.
The Czech representation also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification for the European Championship.
Montenegrains found themselves under pressure until the second part because of a precise Czech defense.
The vicitmes of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent in the European championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the box of Czech football.
From the first few minutes we played warrior football.
The two teams were struggling to mount combinations and the game focused mainly around the center line.
The pressure of the national footballers did not manage to break through the Czech defense which responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred college students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Isfahan created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center of Isfahan where uranium is processed.
They have thus openly expressed that they will defend their country’s nuclar program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest information that Iran has not stopped strengthening its nuclear weapons.
There are reports in Israel of a possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
The students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at destroying Iran’s nuclear program, the targets would not only be Isfahan, but also the Natanz site where the uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: does not take breakfast and takes cold meats for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren are above average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families that have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This again shows how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the models that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, for example, cold cuts are found 50% more often than in families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese people had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness campaign "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of small fat people sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most schoolchildren today - only 15% responded that at least once a week parents find time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and involved 900 pupils from primary schools in the Czech Republic.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", an action supported by the General Health Insurance and the company Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children who are overweight or obese is the lack of proper nutrition and not enough physical exercise.
“Only half of the children surveyed indicate, for example, eating breakfast five times a day – in case – lunch – snack – dinner, which is one of the basic principles of a good diet,” says one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast and cold meats for dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development it takes a few basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of student families eat at the same time.
In most families, each has their own breakfast.
And the worst that has been noted is that a tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children, unhealthy fries are consumed more often.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children questioned do sports regularly but for parents this is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food based on their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating."
Among their favorite dishes are many cakes, meats and sweets.
“The most alarming is in particular a great preference for sweetened lemonades,” said the survey results.
For lunch it was the pasta that took the first place just in front of the white meat.
Children did not want starchy foods at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Focus on health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
"During a control of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session "Obesity is not a coincidence", there was a strong desire to move towards a healthy diet," say the results of the survey.
The most striking was, for example, when it came to sweetened lemonades as children began to give preference to drinking water.
Children most often ticked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as the main dish and would cut down on sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech speciality of bread flour or potato dumplings).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In a presentation article about how to learn for stylists, I got a little bit angry that there were a lot of them from the beginning.
I wasn't thinking about what would happen next.
The presentations of three professionals of the specialty, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what happens on the spot.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we get to the final exams, the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it is really "stuffed".
This time we have with the director Alenka (in course there are no boys) treated of how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women like that are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, with no particular curve, another of overweight.
The stylist needs to know how to optically trim wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We managed to highlight the character nicely and also not to dress too conspicuously types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a fine waist.
If there is for example a difference between the waist and hips in such a way that the skirts or pants do not pass at all, it is worth having it made to measure.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is priceless.
In a custom skirt you will feel much better than in one that slides constantly, wraps and does not fit to the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a Tucker style clothing, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or even embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort all the information received.
But I’m also afraid that because of what I have to do at home there are too many.
Each intern was given a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into consideration the current appearance, the type of personality mode as well as its appearance.
I'll have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Deep down, it makes me happy, because it’s better than dressing up Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has gained almost a hundred kilos lately (don’t take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic design.
Reflecting also on the graphic part of styling is also important.
The stylist not only dresses the physical but creates for example productive pages in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, talked to us about all this.
But that,... until Sunday
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests from the specialty gave a diverse look to Saturday’s session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with only one piece of clothing in a different way.
Variability is a prime example of this.
Like for example this trench coat that must be worn in a classic way with jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with pumps and take a picture like a dress.
Or just roll up the sleeves or collar and immediately have a new look.
“Play with that,” he said.
But I particularly appreciated the advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly".
“You can then start to break it,” Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with them, to what, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have many more variations of clothing than the ones that are photographed.
That is to say that for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (so a dozen models) I must be ready to "retail" at least a fortnight.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to deal with this in the course of creating a model.
The fact that the image and style are sometimes half of the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a great singer but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylists' services is still cautious.
And known faces sometimes consider them useless (it is enough that I know something but what I appear passes in the second row).
And if someone gets a styling from us, then we have to rely on him to dictate to us with a high probability a completely different size (smaller) than he actually has.
It then remains for us to navigate on Google and make sure if the boulevard news reports the celebrity in question, if she has slimmed down or grown up etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he dresses and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Know how to guess people, not flatter yourself, keep your opinion.
“When a manager asks you to sort out her closet and fill it with new stuff, you can’t throw it all away and say, ‘Oh my God, what a horror.’
“You’ll find a few things that you’ll find pretty and him that you’ll advise with what to wear them with,” says Mario.
This one showed us concretely what everything should contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
This is the one you hang around the waist and have on you for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, unpiling rollers or nurse pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which we close a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple are not usable because they could damage the garment).
So that we were not only people who listened but who tried something in a practical way they taught us how to properly re-seal shoes.
And during the photo shoot in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we stuck and stuck.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors so as not to inadvertently injure ourselves.
We really need skills.
Mario made me happy when he congratulated me on my creation.
The countdown I'm reporting isn't for my girlfriend.
This is only a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of classes
I am beginning to understand that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, let everyone say what they want.
The need for speed The Run is fought across America.
Revision
Originally a problem-free race turns into a set of stupid mistakes by people who have nothing to do with a routine morning commute to work.
It fulfills everyone’s ambition to a certain extent, but it’s useless if no one wants to do something more.
The new part subtitled The Run produced great expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already aged Need for Speed racing series and release some sort of game from the playable parts that would not only count with points.
So we were curious about the added passages where the main hero gets out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole shoots down because of a few unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of an incomprehensible idleness on the part of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught up in the adventure whose main hero Jack has character problems and to fix them starts to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the West Coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on a different route and the stages planned in different environments that stand out quite well from each other and are interesting.
The player does not feel for a moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are also pretty nice even if the graphic technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
This is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very visually pleasing.
The events are in addition from time to time embellished with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly decreases your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Next to this the different races are well arranged one behind the other.
There are only a few, but that is enough.
There are moments you strive to surpass the requested number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the clock (classic duel with the stopwatch) and then still awaits you another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police coming into the game and trying to make the situation difficult for you.
The novelty is the out-of-vehicle passages.
It’s more of an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away in front of someone and you have to help him by tapping the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than what you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
As a result, this is good because this element is not likely to interfere and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that enhance the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that at present there is nothing extraordinary, but it cannot be said to be negative.
As for the realistic simulation you will have to go elsewhere.
But although one can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything is ok.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
At the difference of the driving model, that of the collisions is not yet at the point.
We don’t expect this game to have complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don’t have, during a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, it’s not completely good.
During tight overtaking you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car goes in crazy aerobatic.
Or is it crumbling.
Thanks to the reboot system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The reboot is done in such a way that when you broke your face or went out in the scenery the game takes you back to the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you must start the game again from the beginning.
So it’s more of a tool, in case something doesn’t go right, than something you can really rely on.
Sometimes restarts do not help and you have to find the solution by remembering the piece of route in question.
The big catch of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are certain turns that must be passed in a certain way otherwise it does not pass.
Otherwise you encounter on a given place "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute late.
What makes you angry are the situations when you see the opponent pass easily between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you must either put yourself aside and conturn them or brake.
It does not matter if you go to meet him because it is "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always arrives very close to your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you arrive in certain places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This gets the most upset at the end of the game when you ride on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must pass in front of you at all costs.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide a good number of times.
One can understand that the goal of this game is to do something captivating and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that's going on.
And it doesn't matter if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there's no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea is to change cars during races.
You have to pay attention to the gas pumps on the routes because you can change cars there however most of the time the one you have is enough for you.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American displacements for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic attires on highly technical drives for example on yaw roads in the mountains.
And the challenge mode, which are races in particular places that you know of adventure, goes very well with the main diet of the story.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects start to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog function, which compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the hardest moves to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks like).
Your speedometer tells you between 150 and 200 km/hour (a priori) and behind you comes a subway train that sends you the car directly to the scrap.
At the writing we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought when creating this game or if the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally nice and in some cases really great.
What bothers is that in more extreme situations, the imagery does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This especially concerns accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imaging is no longer useful to you.
The sound part is good and the track is your choice.
In order to please as many people as possible and especially the younger audience, a new sound track has been created in the "I mix everything" style, but we can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General Impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confusing.
If the game didn’t have these stupid mistakes we could safely say that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game feels like it’s not finished.
The fun is really good but be prepared for mistakes to hit you in the eye with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativists and eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically eliminated the balance between the institutions"
“I didn’t expect such a tough war.”
“It will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all the players get used to their new role,” said Milena Vicenova, the Czech ambassador to the European Union.
When she was able to describe the different bodies of the EU and their relations in such a comprehensible and visible way, to the point that a large number of lecturers from Charles University's Faculty of Law might envy her, she showed how seriously she takes her "understandable and openly about Europe" motto.
Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning there were criticisms that he's bland, that he's a cudgel, that he can't take on any mission and I have to say that he took everyone's breath away because he plays his part perfectly."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of where Europe should go."
She explained the new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "What telephone number should I call?", thus as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater readability of the Union's policy vis-à-vis states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our syrecky (cooked cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that the European Council has lived, is living and will live in the near future.
She called the Czech presidency a success two years ago.
The Czechs have solved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or have organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She described the fall of the government as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is very busy at the moment.
In the words of the Ambassador, "activity has been in full swing" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved even now.
We must also approve the Union's new seven-year budget, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it seems that the budget will be slim and with a view to savings, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is to be resolved in the context of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or crooked pickles, bananas that are different in size or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky.
She wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who only see things in their negative aspect more than positively.
Moreover, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
According to her, the fault is due to several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a cover letter and weak support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she then highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
“Believe me, when the Pole, the Magyar, the Slovak come to me, this Frenchman says to me: ‘Hey, what are you doing there, what is this Visegrad group still doing?’ and he’s not at all happy.”
According to Ms Vicenova, in the near future new tough fiscal policy rules await the member countries.
It is the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed, Europe that prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
“We have countries in the euro zone and others outside the zone.”
“We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute for Enhanced Cooperation.”
In the first place, it was said that the countries that want it and those that don’t want to stay in their corner are cooperating with each other.”
“There will be a lot of institutes of this type and there will be a really two-speed Europe,” Vicenova said.
From this point of view it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the bases according to which all the topics having an impact on the EU should be discussed among all the members of the EU and not only the members of the eurozone.
History of a brand:
IBM Innovator Begins Second Century of Its Existence
If someone were to look for the term that most closely expresses the IBM strategy, the closest would be “the long term.”
For a large audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The foundation for this long-term strategy was laid by the firm’s first leader, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left the slogan that many global problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
Its slogan "PENSE'!" became the imprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
This was the basis of Watson's carefully crafted corporate culture.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years because it always remained true to its core values and yet was not afraid to change all the others around it.
This has enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more" dilapidated for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to care for his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid vacations, employer-paid insurance plus a stylish employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and marketers.
Similarly, IBM has a well-developed system of customer relationships.
The company was at first brilliant at discovering talent – as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus had a choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has been with IBM for thirty years and currently serves as Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years has been doing what is known as jamy, online brain-storming from which many future strategies and innovations have emerged.
No wonder he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures a secure position in the business field.
“From the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than a technology firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor of economics at the Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a technology firm, but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology,” said Geogre Colony of Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating that market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is colloquially called in the United States in regard to its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the largest companies in the world.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the level of server products up to nanotechnology.
It holds numerous patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of its employees have been awarded a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries are the ATM, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM found itself this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in advance
Not all innovations and fabrications had the preference of the customer and of the time - IBM for example did not succeed in betting on an OS/2 operating system, the online Prodigy service or the IBM PCjr computer:
“From the moment your business is built on movement ahead of time you can’t emotionally hang on to the past,” Palmisano said.
For this IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft competitor, which initially stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a preponderant place.
However still in 1990 she was with more than the strongest participation motié representing hardware.
Starting in the year 2000 IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, during this period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM is trading on the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Economic Crisis also increased its investment volume.
It now appears that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
IBM’s share price rose by 120 percent from 2008, and the company’s net profit continues to grow.
The IBM logo is to change everything but not its values.
We can expect this flexible giant to master other crises.
History of IBM: From cheese slices to flights into the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York City a hundred years ago; it originally had the complicated name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a trademark used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 80s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointers", clocks that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 chaired the Supervisory Board of the company.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the firm’s founder – it was Watson’s ideas that have so far underpinned the company’s identity and culture.
Watson ran the firm until 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce – from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
During Watson's first four years of leadership, revenue increased to $9 million and the firm began to expand to all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of management it was his son who occupied the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM's people and computers helped NASA guide flights into the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight to the Moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 came onto the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consulting company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to take care of consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been successful at IBM for the last three years is the Smarter Planet concept.
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and city management.
IBM recently developed a “Smarter Commerce” platform that helps salespeople manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history in our territory as well.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
Central and Eastern Europe is headquartered in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team that deals with speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53) said, it’s over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for the future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave Bartosova summer shelter in her house, she had no idea that her couple would not hold on.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not push back the singer.
And he confessed in public that he loved her.
With time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's affair and ended up saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome him on the doorstep of the house.
“He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will put him out.”
“He will no longer be my beloved and lost old donkey, but a man with whom I have a special relationship,” Rychtarova said, showing that she broke away from her husband but that they only remain in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door to him is not a problem for Joseph.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I will stay with Iveta and not change."
“My wife has a wedding on paper and I respect that.”
"The company goes on, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
“With Darina we talk in a completely normal way but we don’t sleep together,” Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he will not prevent it.
“We don’t sleep together and I don’t care where she goes, with whom and if she has an affair.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Does it concern you too?
If you ask men to determine the typical vices of women, all of them, both of them, are able to take them "out of their sleeve".
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of feminine vices that manage to pump blood from the veins of men.
Purchases
Does your partner tell you that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one piece of clothing per week?
Are you happy to buy and in packs at the time of the sales?
In your case we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you will say, which one would resist the window shopping of clothing stores, to look for nice clothes for oneself and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become for the man a real hell.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse that he is waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
“I would need to lose at least 5 pounds – should I start playing sports?”
"Do you like me?"
Don’t these phrases remind you of something?
Yeah?
So you’re one of those women who’s obsessed with how they look.
This is not the question you should stop caring for yourself but a lot of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
The stronger sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases, the more women become poisonous.
The odre and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite merry-go-round.
Wash windows, vacuum, clean floors, make dust, strip the bathroom - and this twice a week.
You make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they have dirty the sink, dirty the glass of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you are suffering from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can, however, spoil your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sape
"Put that worn out tracksuit in the trash."
“Are you going to wear those socks tomorrow?”
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor."
If you do this work on your partner in this way several times a day, you will really break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn’t have to do so much undermining work.
Defamation, Persiflage
Defamation, persiflage but also insults against someone are also unique to some women.
Women are particularly attracted to relationships and so are happy to deal with topics like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets out a harmless little persiflage here and there.
The hand on the heart is a particularity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persuade, even despise others and are especially dangerous for those around them – especially at work in a women’s collective.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the Philadelphia win
Hokeyist forward Jagr has twice participated in Philadelphia’s win during Monday’s NHL game on Carolina’s ice and is once again leading the productive Czech players for the contest.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made another pass and was named the best player of the match, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the match.
Jagr after the match told reporters across the Atlantic that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great night.
“I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick.”
"I felt it."
“Sometimes that feeling falls on you,” Jagr explained after his Giroux action scored a goal from the Flyers’ first shot.
A moment later there was a second assault by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes goals for the puck and introduced him to goaltender Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player in the league but he’s really one of the top three,” Jagr said of his center.
“I never thought I’d play late in my career with a hokeyjist like him.”
“I’m really happy with that.”
“I want to play on him.”
“All these years at the NHL the other players on the team have been trying to play on me, now it’s my turn,” Jagr added.
Caroline did a drama of that match because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she ended up with a goal difference.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that ended up two to one.
“Pronger has carried out some excellent attacks in our area.”
"He hit the puck, I picked up speed and (Read) went to the far corner of the cage.
“I tried to hit him and I got there,” describes the final goal of the match from his point of view Voracek.
Philadelphia came with this victory at the top of the Eastern Conference.
Czech Montreal defender Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo, but came out in the second period due to an injury in the upper body.
The Candians did not stand against an experienced defender their lead of two goals and lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
It was the fact that the back line was sick that mostly bothered the local coach rather than lost poins because they played the game only with 5 defenders.
"That sucks."
“We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young people.
“But there’s nothing to do, it’s like that,” says Jacques Martin.
“Replacement on replacement wasn’t enough and we couldn’t resist.”
“We just had to simplify the game, push the puck out of our zone.”
For that we had limits,” added one of the defenders P.K. Subban.
Czech defender Ondrej Pavelec took part in Winnipeg’s 30th attack and victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in the Jets, who stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered trips mostly to socialist bloc countries, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A big exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have an inclination for the west and trips to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
In case the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually for example to Poland or the Soviet Union he needed a letter of invitation otherwise the individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West however it was necessary to wait in line all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The currency deal that was the condition for traveling west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of currencies (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs spent most of their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and chalets that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
Since 1989, the Czechs have experienced a great revolution.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at their maximum, the Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million vacation days in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 90s of the last century in neighbouring countries of the west has caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially to Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for a long time travel by air to the west that everyone wanted to see at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations put Czechs to sleep in tents in the parks because our income did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a trip by Czechs at that time was to take with you your own canned food, sausage, etc... to save money.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which allowed our tourists finally after decades to be able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wage increased which caused around 1997 another important moment.
Thanks to a growing demand for travel travel agencies have started since 1997 to prepare tours with air charter connections that through contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to what was before.
At the end of the 90s of the last century the Czechs had visa-free connections with practically most of the developed countries of the world apart from the US which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, was prepared from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to far away hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development arrived in 2008.
On 17 November 2008 the US abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to completely fall into the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time again in history spent more than 15,000 kroner per person for holidays abroad including ancillary charges. kroner per person.
The General Assembly must find its President but this risks ending in a situation without a solution "a pat"
Almost 5 months already Czech football is without President and it risks that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after yet a General Assembly to be held Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on which voting rules to proceed.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek did football backtrack to divergences between the Association's chambers that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely evident on September 16 when a new president had to be chosen.
Delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague as negotiations remained stalled and there was no question of even dealing with how to elect.
There was no agreement as to who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seemed, the statutory representatives or even the officials with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since that moment with the assistance also of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences continue over the rules for the election.
It is all too clear that the executive committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also contributed nothing to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the focus remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the pat.
"The bone of contention lies in the following fact: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda, which represents professional football in the association.
According to the rules of the planned model wins in the third round the one of the candidates who will have received the most votes in percentage within the chamber for which he is candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to withdraw so that wins the candidate who will have received the largest percentage of votes of the two chambers.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only then would it lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely refuse the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda who understands the objections of the Moravian side and according to which the best would be not to change the rules and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even if he believes that the settlement of the elections established according to the statutes advantage the most Pelta among all the candidates.
"I hope that we will vote as much as possible according to the statutes of the association."
"So that there are not yet crazy ideas imagined by a representative as during the past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations has defined himself above all against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and in a constructive way.
“The qualification possible today in the European Championship should calm everyone down.”
"Football will once again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more enthusiasm for cooperation," adds the officer of Jablonec who among the three has the greatest experience in the direction of football both professionally and at the regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
“It’s not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the drawing regulations.”
“This can cause a blockage in the General Assembly again.”
“I still hope that healthy reason will win,” Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but who can tell if the whole direction of the football will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight to Podgore, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was being sought to take part of the Executive Committee to the retaliatory field.
In the end, it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, that should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the torn parts within the strongest sports association in the country and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to the fight for the post of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If the head of Plzen footballers Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asks for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be campaigning for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not stand for election."
“But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate,” Paclik told the Czech News Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta from becoming the head of AFRT, which would be a favorite for this election.
Paclik also points out that in case he wins the elections he would hold this post of President only until 2013 year scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would see in the position an experienced and high-level manager but who is not linked with the world of football.
“I’ve talked to people who have profiles,” he says.
“For me it was terrible when some people told me they didn’t want to be identified with Czech football at the moment.”
“I’d like to change that image,” he added.
What Paclik is said to be particularly bothering is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Plzen Roman Berbr Regional Football Union, a man of reverse renown who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist able to influence the vote of the delegates’ general assembly.
For Paclik, it is not acceptable for Pelta to hold this position as President.
“If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football.”
“And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying trader, it would be even less favorable to football,” Paclik said.
What still shocks him is the fact that Pelta’s name was uttered a few years ago during wiretaps as part of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta escaped without any penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen."
In the event that Paclik triumphs in Thursday’s vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been backed by Paclik before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco, thinks the same.
“He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go with.”
“He has great abilities.”
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as head of the representation."
"But as a manager of the Association he would not be able."
“I don’t put my nose into what I don’t know,” says Paclik, who in September attracted a lot of attention when he voted for the cancellation of the Referees’ Commission with Ludek Macela, replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to lead private companies and that he also manages since last year the club of Plzen which celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the first division.
“I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and bring a certain culture to it.”
"I would curb the influence of certain interested groups who have for example a tendency to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," added Paclik who does not chase his antipathy for the leader of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose power to lobby high-level politicians would make it possible to obtain more money for sport from the tax on games.
“This is one of the key points that the new president should take care of.”
“If it’s about the gambling tax as the political parties say, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money is going,” he said.
Paclik does not take his current liaison with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the AFRT President should be "above the parties".
Pelta is once again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla from Prague.
"That's not ideal."
I don’t see any reason to pass on my Plzen club actions to anyone if I have to come back a year and a half later,” Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that should put an end to pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidate Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end in the future to the quarrels about the rules for the elections.
Jablonec's official is ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and believes that the success today of the football representation should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta before the September election, which did not come true, promised to devote himself to national representation and obtaining financial means if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the last General Assembly and this delay of two months could well allow him to defend his vision of the direction of football and to present it in a broad context.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a president on Thursday.”
“They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the leadership of the Association,” he adds, but he is above all linked with the club of Jablonec, has worked for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
That’s also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hasek.
“Unfortunately at the June General Assembly statutes were approved that were not perfect as all have noticed.”
“If it weren’t for all these different interpretations, we would have had a president since September,” Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took the delegates' full attention.
“If I become president, I take it as a personal mission and am willing to take all the responsibility in case it doesn’t work.”
“It’s a principle without which we can’t exist,” Pelta added.
Then he tries, they say, not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can co-operate with Jindrich Rajchl, whom he acknowledges with respect to his legal background, and that he knows full well that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He has also not attacked for a long time Tonas Paclik who on the contrary does not stop criticizing Pelta.
“He’s been in football for a year and has already had some successes.”
"His attacks were however not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"This is also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta told his opponent but remains, he said, true to the proclamations he made in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from competitions of the lowest level to the national representation.
It should be a football tournament.
"And I would also try to finish all the business that starts with the Bohemians or the continuation of the corruption scandal."
“I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all the football,” the 46th candidate told the Czech News Agency two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not lead to any change of people.
“I should get to know all the employees,” he told Strahov, where there has been understandable nervousness since there was no management.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
“If there is a single point of contention about how to vote in the third round we will manage to surpass it.”
"Football needs credibility and he will only get it when there is a new leader at the helm," Pelta said optimistically two days before the day is likely to be decisive for his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership AFRT will start working hard
"If current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at Thursday's General Assembly it would not please many people, it seems.
Rajchl promises, however, that in the event that he is elected one will begin to work hard.
He wants systemic changes and makes the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
“As president, I want to take care of football as a whole.
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and high-performance youth football."
“But I’m not saying I’ll do all of this alone,” Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member takes care of a specific area."
“And I will be handing out tough missions so that football faces a big step forward.”
"A lot of people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He said he would not run as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know if it’s worth it and if I’ll have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and cast doubts on every single one of my actions,” he said.
“A lot of people have told me I don’t have to give up because they would give up too.”
“It’s a trust I can’t betray,” he says.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
“For the past two years there has been a lot of hard work and I don’t want to let it go.”
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hasek.
“I believe in systematic work and that’s something Mirek Pelta doesn’t know how to do.”
“Behind him are people who played football in such a way that he would only be for those who were chosen.”
"I can be blamed for a number of things but surely not to bear anyone."
“I try to be objective.”
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy with it not just those who have been chosen.
And he again confirms that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
“And if there are those who say otherwise, I am ready to do my utmost for Moravia.”
For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian whose winners would end up in the first division.
“There would be no situation like it is now with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of president, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I feel constant support from the Czech Chamber, which elected me its Vice President and knows that with me there will be successes," said Rajchl, who plans among his future successes to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiations of contracts with television and on the law on games.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault of all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
“No one can doubt Plzen that he did a great job this year.”
“If elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make any noticeable change among people in the Commissions.”
“He wouldn’t want to spoil his successes,” said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.

Swimming pools in UFO optics, Budapest's magnificent swimming pools: Whoever travels through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can let his tired legs rest in sparkling water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder was going on a research trip for the last 18 months, there’s one thing that shouldn’t be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she watched the artistically arranged domes, and swam against the Putten marbles that awaited her across the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If an indoor swimming pool pleased her, she immediately noted in her notebook all the details worthy of interest on the type of construction and on the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by architecture historian Meder and she presented them in her already published book: "Badefreuden (Joys of the Bath). The municipal covered pools of Munich, the historic bathhouses in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true devotee of bathing culture.
Meder, explains that she does not have much interest in the sport but she feels attracted to the water in a totally different way.
It is irritating that swimming fans have to be content to contemplate blue tiles and accommodate the stench of bleach while joggers breathe spellbinding scent from spruce forests or can listen to the chirping of cheerful birds from the park.
"I once wondered why swimming pools must in fact be so ugly," said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
A dip in a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - wellness factor in swimming rooms are huge because all the senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders would have given themselves a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor one has a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is on the one hand transparent, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multicolored tiles, springboards.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to take a leap into the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable examples during her research in Hungary.
Next to the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing water in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of baths whose pools are filled with water containing alkali and (Vorosi Termalf?rd? in J?szberény)
On the other hand, the heated outdoor swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zurich bath one has the whole city in one's eyes, one can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which one can observe the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design is waiting for swimmers in Luengenfeld: The Aqua Dome looks like a UFO that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background rise the mountains of the Oetztal towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of bleach does not emanate from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emit a smell of sulfur, from the bekescsaba-spa in Hungary emanates a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be found in a health spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its silt sticks to your skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for beautiful pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded lot.
In the meantime, the bath designed by the architect Dusan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed.
Looking out the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the flowering of weeds between the tiles.
She observed a contrary effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: The Bad Wildbad Thermal Palace.
This building has already survived three phases; one can discover not only neo-Roman elements that come out since its design in 1844 but also a Moorish room in Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite bath of pool expert Iris Meder – and not just because she is from Schwarzwald.
“It’s already a great performance to blend such different building styles into such a great unit,” Meder says.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural Speculation
German bank examines commodity speculation in detail
by Christian Teevs
Is the German bank abandoning its speculation on commodities?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann instructed a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions stop this business avenue because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the speculation of the stock exchanges on global raw materials, pushes the prices up and that the banks share a complicity in the global famine.
The consumer protection campaign is concretely aligned against Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting in the same way.
Commodity speculation was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts in the meantime share the opinion that bettors have detached themselves from offers and demand – and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently from American competitors: he promised to investigate the reproaches and said, "No case is worth jeopardizing the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE an international working group is currently examining the Foodwatch-Report accusations.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the board of directors of Deutsche Bank must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could lead to a reduction in the raw materials market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his Image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticisms of the financial sector: “Speculation about rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way, how badly banks today are harming the general interest.”
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation today.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculation,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it’s about the hungry people or whether Deutsche Bank’s reputation is at stake.”
Ackermann’s awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the group’s CEO wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman of the board of directors will not change anything that is planned in the board of directors.
It could improve its brand image with an abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation.
And when it comes to potential losses, he doesn’t have to worry about them – his successor will.
One out of two would terminate commodity investments.
Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the survey Tuesday, with which on November 7 and 8 the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 people.
Just 11 percent found it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments for which food price bets are made.
Many of the bank's clients would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: one in two would, following the survey, terminate all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
Forty-three percent would not recommend such a bank to their entourage, 49% responded that they would consider cancelling their account to change bank.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion That Moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups, downs and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions of Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin.
Now it is open again and acts as an exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about modern post-war architecture, for its clear shapes, glass sheds, bright and bold looks and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its light and suspended steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered until today as an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian World's Fair.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the World's Fair in the Swiss Garden at Vienna's South Station, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang works of art, so not a good environment.
However it was used for as long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and increasingly dilapidated.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name of "House of the 21st century" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Belvedere Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck from any point of view.
The new beginning was carried out by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career in her youth as a figure skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she particularly carried out the transformation work with politicians and the protection of monuments, she obtained public funds and private sponsoring and established it.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a café and a bookshop are there, and an office is to be built there.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had sensitively transformed and expanded Joseph Olbracht's secession and won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "virtually every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness following its move to Vienna and by its change of use.
During the current transformations, there were big problems: the building was "a sinkhole in energy," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, insulated glass reinforced with glass fibers was laid and the roof replaced by a special safety glass.
The beams of the thermal bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new farm, a dimmed light panel between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - this is almost a new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors remained, the house is painted in a rust protection shade of red-brown color.
And the movie theater is even exactly the same as it once was.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for the monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and inexpensive had to be found, and that also please the protection office monuments," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to raw ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, “which came from Brussels,” Krischanitz said recently, a typical “Drop-in-the-City” story.
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of luck of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands the newly planned "neighborhood of the central station", with offices and apartments.
And another stroke of luck may happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, she is already negotiating with the city in order to get a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend in this regard more than 70 million additional this year.
The daily newspaper "Bild"-Zeitung reported beforehand, citing an internal crisis plan for the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snow removal of railway installations and platforms should, among other things, double to 16,000 people.
The goal is to clear the docks of snow and ice until the beginning of the service phase and 90 percent of the track devices required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the station chief Radiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of the train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacks, among other things, reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
This is how many new regional trains have been waiting for an authorization from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had a lot of work to do for years, since it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked much more often at the workshop, after an axle break occurred on an ICE at Cologne Central Station.
German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the United States.
After the case of the head Josef Ackermann there is something new in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if Deutsche Bank’s problems were not enough, the past of this giant of the sector catches up with him in the USA: the Frankfurt institute pays in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle a dispute because of the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The regulator of the NCUA financial markets is charging the big banks with making false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost tremendous value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks down.
"We are satisfied that we were able to find a solution on this matter, without the parties starting a court proceeding," a Deutsche Bank spokesman said in New York.
In comparison, the Bank did not admit any wrongdoing.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for cooperative banks in the United States and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the multi-billion dollar damage.
The comparisons made now are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks to task and in the summer it sued JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
When it comes to mortgage documents, it’s called “Mortgage-backed Securities.”
The credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even if the events are already a few years old, at the moment it blows on the American banks a storm wind.
Investors and supervisors have filed numerous lawsuits to seek redress or to sanction defaults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks, the two US state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of having advantaged in kind during mortgage deals of about 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with the FHFA, which represents several transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities request that the Frankfurter be held liable for "substantial losses" but without citing a specific sum.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unjustified and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett Increases $10 Billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, invests huge sums in IBM’s IT business.
Since March, it has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until then, the big American investor Warren Buffett explains constantly not to invest in IT companies, since the long-term evolution of the companies reveal only bad forecasts.
He did, however, read IBM’s reports and changed his view on investing in this sector.
He had already understood much earlier that IBM mainly offers IT services and systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knightly attack in the world of finance.
As a result, IBM's IT business is now entitled to be called "Mr. IBM".
Buffett revealed today on the CNBC economic show that he has been buying IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become a major shareholder of IBM with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM has never known anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, which even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable profits.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services for some time as the operation of accounting centers.
The pioneer of IT, more than 100 years old, offers both Software and consulting as well as high-performance business calculators.
Buffett had so far rather avoided tech companies.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
But on the contrary Buffett attacks rather the rail freight, manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares in a range of large groups such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Ruck.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and established it as one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That’s why he’s a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of earning money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of Buffett's investment, IBM shares rose one percent on the stock market.
Big Blue, also known as IBM, has a market value of more than $220 billion and is one of the world’s most valuable technology companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn’t want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a great friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would be reborn now.
The assassinations of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey as well as the German-Turkish population reacts with fear and concern.
For many German-Turkish people, the spectre that had long been thought to be dead has been re-emerging: since the incendiary attacks in Muelln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
That there is xenophobia in Germany has never been mentioned.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
“Is this a return to bloody ideology?” was the headline of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk’s internet publication.
The newspaper "Sabah" points out that one of the authors was a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right quagmire.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted in a reasoned manner: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence outside the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks before the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
Reports from some Turkish media make the effect of a slap: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Thus the German publication of the "Horriyet" does not hesitate to draw unequivocal conditions from it.
"It begins to stink", this is the title of Ahmet Kulahci's chronicle.
He points out that people were murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was perceived very critically on the German-Turkish forums and these had subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why it has not already come to the mind of the German authorities much earlier to do research in certain suspicious circles of the extreme right, surprise the authors.
More than one is ready at least for rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be sloppy, there will be nothing left for migrants but self-defense and armaments."
“It will be the best self-defense.”
"Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of the information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," Selen wrote.
What this means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks in M?lln and Solingen in the 90s have explained well.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, what distrust and distance by acts of violence could lead to.
The attacks, however, sharpened the sense of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past, it was mainly the failure of German policy after the attacks complained of by the Turkish press: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Muelln.
After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech, how many taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax burden.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the distrust of many Germano-Turkish people has been towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to efforts to further clarify and reassess right-wing terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time around.
The scandalous bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost gone bankrupt in the financial crisis and is patina in the meantime from one crisis to the next.
It is a German who must lead now.
That’s certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it became known in July that he would occupy in 2013 an almost as spectacular position: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber has publicly rejoiced, praised; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently obtained solidity and has passed on kind observations on future colleagues.
"UBS has successfully completed Turnaround".
"I am delighted with the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Gruebel."
And yet, as early as September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all of the bank’s security systems and had torched about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of directors of UBS Oswald Gruebel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
UBS's Chairman of the Board has since been seen as suffering - and everyone is asking: When is Axel Weber finally coming back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the presidency of the administration already in May - not in 2013, as announced by the bank Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this is becoming difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adjustment.
All of a sudden, he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long deserved the title of "Europe's largest scandal bank".
Indeed, UBS is on one side huge - until recently, it was the world's biggest asset manager, and on the other, it has been skating for years from one scandal to the next.
Nothing seems to spare the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also cunning, she had combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from affluent customers than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s largest banks.
That made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later banking professor for many years in Zurich says: "I have always taken UBS as a model of good banking in front of my students."
"From the current perspective, we ask ourselves: how could I have simply been so wrong?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something was wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew in a surprising way, who was until then considered a high intellectual as well as a brilliant banker.
A few months later, it became clear why he had left.
The division of the bank had blazed with subprime documents and had to make a cross over billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this she did indeed find investors, but who, shortly before, would have frowned: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was ignored, to the point that one never even learned its name.
But that was only the first shot.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank had to announce again losses amounting to billions, the chairman of the board Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second highest paid board of directors in Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: UBS was, given its investment mistakes, in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - as she has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country, to house such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
“We couldn’t save UBS again,” says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, the second followed.
Already a few months before, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the affluent clientele, who had defrauded the tax authorities perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million – in return for unjustified profits from these operations with an increased fine.
So UBS has more or less published that it has helped with tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something that has always been her capital competing with wealthy clients: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
In a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: banking investment because of bad speculation and asset management because of aid to tax fraud.
And, as there was somewhat of a return to calm, and as we thought, that the UBS would get away with it, it followed this unfortunate story of securities dealers: a single securities dealer burns 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realizes that something was wrong.
And we publish: with risk management in investment banking it still does not seem to work.
“With the Adoboli case, we have seen that risk management has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
Also the chief financial officer of a major German bank is sure: "the problem with UBS is that it does not have control of the risks in hand."
However, it was exactly the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long since assumed their function, that of becoming guardians of the world’s great wealth: not too great risks, but security for money – and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of unshakable reliability, as Lindt and Sprongli do for a particularly noble chocolate.
UBS’s Zurich power plant still goes hand in hand with the strong cliché of the private Swiss bank – it’s only a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank is headquartered at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, with store rents among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops as well as those of the Sprongli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank to the Credit Suisse Palace to elitist private banks like Julius Bor.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bank, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another dismissed the market - or betrayed the two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the paper, eventually like all Swiss bankers he does business also with the two big banks.
The UBS would have become far too big, he finds - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would also have spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And even so, they have long adapted to the mores of the Anglo-Saxons."
It was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution lost so much money in the sub-prime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
“This Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation,” writes author Lukas Hoessig in his book The UBS Crash.
With up to 68 billion francs or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks jointly concluded a huge group.
A bank was set up, which was already too big for the little Switzerland - and has been steadily growing.
What helped was that UBS’s two different predecessor banks completed: a rich, but lethargic bank with asset management in Zurich as its strong point and a poorer, but certainly already more heavily internationalized one.
All of a sudden, the international investment banks had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
“Wuffli, the great, modest intellectual, who gets along very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who made his way to the top with the bank’s learning.”
But Ospel would have trusted Wuffli until the end.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: “He thought his models were reality,” Geiger says.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: exuberance happened before the fall.
UBS staff clearly remembers the leaders’ meetings at which the head of the Wuffli group always said the same watchword: dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She commissioned the "League Tables" rankings, which at that time documented the banks' success.
After all, the UBS wanted to go all the way up.
Some steps have already succeeded.
When it comes to currency and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
The business advisors, who had the responsibility, however pointed out a weakness: in international transactions of interest, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
UBS is said to have gaps in U.S. mortgage revenues.
To fill this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost its life.
Hungry for growth, it is as much the bank itself as a management fund created before it in the American sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has morphed into a massive machine that has packaged and passed value documents based on U.S. mortgages – but has also retained risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to go down.
"Still in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," said Geiger, the bank expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts proved more difficult than we thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and have so far been wobbly.
Whoever runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
It has to find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn’t want to go that far (yet).
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as far as is clear so far.
Next Thursday the bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank broke up with surprise from its predecessor, Gruebel.
In the meantime, he has established himself: he must conduct the business of UBS sustainably, the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress in the mid-1990s.
It has cut 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He only says publicly so far that he and his wife are going to find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock market
The threat of a recession in Europe at the end of the week has discouraged American investors.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
Industrial production on the continent has stifled hopes for a stabilisation of the debt crisis in its seed.
The general relief on the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass I still had last week only half filled, not half emptied - but now the problems are pressing once again in the foreground, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.
Especially the financial values were on the sales sheets.
The Dow-Jones-Index defaults at the close of the markets recorded a loss of about 0.6% at 12,078 points.

Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from the banks.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett has only confirmed this caution: “It’s not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do anything to end the crisis,” he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was too early from his point of view to invest in bonds coming from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle to the winds and entered the American tech industry.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of this traditional group, and allowed it to rate almost more than 1%, against the trend of business management.

Smart crows are spreading in cities
In many places, frogs are considered a "bird problem" but experts say these very intelligent animals have not been hunted in cities for a long time.
Some like them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows have been in the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents multiply because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts said that it is no longer possible to chase frets from cities.
Experts from all over Germany deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities.
The protectors of nature also based the problems of cities on the exodus of particularly protected freux: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional living spaces.
Hunting, development and felling of typical brooding trees made life difficult for birds.
Crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 brooding pairs in the west-west Soest, in the north-west including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project gained negative publicity because of the slaughter of crows in this region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with clubs particularly brutal.
"Normal eviction, eviction, is of no use," said Leer's city and landscape planner Werner Kluver.
Destruction of nests using water under pressure or felling trees often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Wuerttemberg.
“Animals move away, large colonies divide, and they disperse to other places.”
The eviction is imaginable only in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We find ourselves obliged to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of animal gutting with aversive conditioning and eye-catching offerings, to allow them to relocate.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jurgens was prospecting "info boards instead of chainsaws" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better bear a pimple in the face with a dose of self-confidence."
He co-founded the Schleswig-Holstein-Schleswig-Holstein Ascheberger-Educative Pathway, a road sign informing about the life of these highly intelligent freux.
In the meantime, this project has been adopted by tourists.
Jurgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of noise caused by birds: "There is a great deal of communication, these birds have a lot to say to each other".
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: the freux not only use working instruments to arrive at a treat but they make their own tools as working instruments.
Ethologists at the University of Cambridge were testing four freux recently, how far the intelligence of birds comes.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to collapse a scaffold with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they were determined to recognize that a stone had to have certain size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second trial, the clever crows then had to solve a more stocky problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their loot with their beaks.
However, the researchers had put pieces of wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four were successful even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks remained without success.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the playoffs at the 2012 European Championship in Poland and knocked out Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal lost to Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after 0:0 of the match, his fifth participation in the European championship.
The Czechs reached the playoff return game by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first inning (2:0), had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was more hot in the 0:0 draw between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) break against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11-meter penalty played by hand (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) twice made a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free kick of 30 meters in advance in the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed off his shooting qualities from a distance and shot at a distance of 25 meters to do 2:0.
The Bosniaks, who in the first half-hour did nothing, had their first clear chance thanks to forward Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger, the leader of the English league of Manchester City has initiated a head ball directed towards the bottom of the crossbar, the ball has not crossed the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek shot a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the center of all attentions.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the counter side, Stark granted a controversial hand-played 11-meter penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But after the break, the 2004 European vice-champion made four shots and it all became clear.
For the Czech, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to EM for a fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek’s team with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (Nuremberg), also got lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech reflexively prevented a last-minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation on the penalty area right next to Cech’s shot.
After the break, the cross had to come to the rescue of the already shot-down Czech world-class goalkeeper, again, the FC Seoul striker had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb during this time.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to abandon his place on the bench of the third of EM of 2002, the Croats were able to look forward to their fourth round in the final of the European championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the post, attacking Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia gained more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to VfL Wolfsburg's Mario Mandzukic, who was replaced by Dortmund's Ivan Perisic in the 62nd Minute, Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the field.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the team away from coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken over with a success of 4:0 the first step for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) tied for visitors.
Ireland pushed at top speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy received the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment the defence of Estonia was able to prevent a possible goal from the -first scorer.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense from goaltender Pavel Londak, Ward was within reach and squeezed the ball onto the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software company, SAP, plans to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Until 2015, about two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, said Tuesday the Dax Group.
“We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly,” CEO Bill McDermott told his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the global leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP’s 176,000 global customers are located in this fast-growing country.
Growth plans in China are also an important part of the Dax Group’s 2015 Strategy.
SAP plans to increase its 2015 revenue to 20 billion euros.
Last year, the Walldorfer recorded an income of nearly 12.5 billion euros.
Currently the business management of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people, has never worked so well.
SAP has been active in China for more than 20 years.
“Now we want to expand our business (...),” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information.”
Personal Mass Slaughter
Peter Englund’s new book, “The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War,” begins with a long list of characters that are heart-wrenching.
One tip to get started: carefully tear this page apart and make it your bookmark.
In this romantic tale by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mists of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
Here he wrote an extraordinary book which he accurately describes as "a work of anti-history."
It has a few well-known names, important treaties, or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion of strategies and materials.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it could look like" and includes "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and Grief" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, paramedics and salespeople.
Some will become heroes.
Others are prisoners of war, some will lose limbs, some will go mad, some will lose their lives.
Their lives are flickering here like the candles of a church: while some are dying out, new ones are being rekindled.
Peter Englund's book deviates from traditional history books.
He refutes the idea that the First World War can only be summed up by the terrible trench warfare on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordite.
When cannon shots sound in the distance, and you are a stay-at-home mom, are you staying or running away?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, “the lack of facts has been fleshed out by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
"Beauty and Grief" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nanny in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German deep-sea fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other previously published documents.
Versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved through the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most deal with deprivation and the ability to cope.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, faux aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
It continues on replacement food in Germany.
He describes "meat made of cooked rice crushed into sheep fat (and finished with a fake wooden bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles."
He claims that "837 licensed substitute meats are registered in sausage production. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories deal with honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive towards savagery and states about the war: "You feel that after all, this is what men were meant for, rather than sitting in a comfortable armchair, a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there are no barbarians behind your shirt emped.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is very likely to die, and that no one will notice or pay attention to him.
“When one is resigned to sacrifice, one hopes to have an audience,” he wrote.
It is, unfortunately, comparable to "a man condemned strangled in secret".
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
“Conflict is becoming more and more a story of economic competition,” writes Peter Englund, “a war between factories.”
He grasps the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who performs his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act in unexpected ways; there are as many basic behaviors as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about the soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the pus trade due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread on the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he wrote.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which results in blindness for life."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures the way war has “triggered forces that are exclusively uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, social revolution, an aversion to religion.”
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making war on them.
The best books dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as Paul Fussel's "Great War and Modern Memory", or Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West Nothing New", rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most damning I’ve read in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it is as if he had sprung up from his book, seized with your hands this page with the list of people and burned with a match.
After a first misstep, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti park would be empty.
The operation remained secret from all but a few high-ranking officers as well as others informed from the beginning that they were going to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the police department.
There could not have been repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, who went against the department’s regulations and generated a storm of public solidarity for protesters.
The operation to clean up Zuccotti Park from its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the progress of occupations in other cities.
A major exercise was organized on the island of Randall, in view of the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots – anti-terrorist measures that involve quickly moving large numbers of police officers – to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place on Monday evening, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders given to move around the park came "at the last minute," said one regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise."
“The few police officers I know who were called did not know that they would go to Zuccotti Park,” the person said on condition of anonymity.
“The only ones who know they’d go there are at the top of the police department hierarchy.”
The city learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean up the park but were repelled by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
Tuesday’s operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from across the neighborhood – dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people came and went to the park during the day, in the manner of migrants, so an hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was necessary to proceed when the park had the fewest people," he said.
Emergency services vehicles equipped with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages resounding from the speakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their light blue windbreaks, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left.
No tents were hit until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving the occupants time to gather their belongings.
Other police teams were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the head of the police department, said the measure was taken solely for security reasons.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, harshly held by the officers.
Browne said the TV camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture footage.
As police moved west through the thick jumble of protesters’ belongings, including luggage, plastic turf and bags of leaves filled with clothes, sanitation department teams followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged, and the images were posted on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters sat near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the police moved to arrest methodically.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp hung together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until 3:30 a.m., Kelly said.
According to police, the clean-up operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of them are for “disturbing public order and rebellion.”
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the most senior officer to have been on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "did not lead the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police were waiting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barricades were placed on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, to the south.
We saw the police expand the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
About 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped on the hood of a police car, while others were seen slitting the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood popped up flying from the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a protester were hospitalized.
School Aid Union sues city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school helpers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals, with a disproportionate impact on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
The lawsuits are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to try to get the layoffs rescinded.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, coordinators of parents and other employees, among the lowest paid in the city, lost their jobs on October 7th. The union leaders compared these redundancies to political revenge for not letting the city access a health care fund led by the workers’ groups, which would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget that closed in June.
A member of the Council responded, mentioning that the dismissals of school aids were in no way specified in the budget.
Council officers from the 37th District said they would complete a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to formally announce the lawsuits at the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
The defendant will be Dennis M. Walcott and the city's Department of Education, and the plaintiffs will be represented by eight laid-off workers, all black or of Latin American origin, like most school assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of redundancies in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and just a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school aides have lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the southern Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school aides at Harlem’s 36 Public School, where 68 percent of schoolchildren live in poverty, the lawsuits say that “It’s not a neighborhood of affluent parents who can bring in funds to fill the budget gap.”
The budget for Public School 36 was cut by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each disadvantaged student enrollment.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators.
The memo used the term "overshoot" to describe the action, although "overshoot" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six coordinators of parents were dismissed", and "not only because of overtaking".
Mission completed: Congress reaches agreement on Libya issue
Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement in the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It took a successful uprising, the capture and death of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, backed by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their "courage".
“This resolution is about honoring the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“It’s bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may be harmless but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties clashed, as well as with the White House, over the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not approving the U.S. military role in NATO’s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to allow limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed, the House of Representatives also rejected a measure to cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
So the U.S. mission remained in a form of legislative purgatory – Congress upset enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not enough to cut off his leg.
Congressional indecision has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee resolution “congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom” and “congratulates the men and women of the US armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also affirms “the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure win all the support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will it divide legislators as it did last June?
Senator and Chair of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
In the Capitol, the House must vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to get a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, backed by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment relating to the budget, or any other matter, to get a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but that is not without trying.
Goodlatte’s amendment is one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in Congress, on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations from a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House alone of the balanced budget amendment, and another handful that would “control federal spending.”
Some of these bills are identical, but give their supporters – especially new Republicans who wish to gild their CVs – the chance to boast of being the “author” of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed last August, called for the House and Senate to vote on a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (D-Illinois) has proposed a host of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of states oppose it.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as quick as they were in the past.
At the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The pace is slowing from the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
“Buried but not beaten,” says Gabrielle Giffords in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot her at point-blank range in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) appeared on a television show Monday night, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover rather than go back to Congress.
During her appearance on ABC's "20/20" television news, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form phrases and needed help walking.
The show addressed his difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing his head.
Three months ago, she made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang – and called her recovery “difficult.”
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Gabrielle Giffords responded “rather well.”
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a one-hour special edition of "20/20", released the day before the release of the couple's new book entitled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special has traced Gabrielle Giffords’ recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a large scar on his forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair as doctors teach her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What?"
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with the doctors the tune of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with the doctors, said she does not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading her an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and first asked for information about the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated pending trial.
“There were a lot of deaths,” Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
When she recovered, Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, “I was beaten.”
"So I'd say, 'Gabby, you haven't been beaten,'" Kelly said.
You were just massacred.
And you're gonna get through it, get well, and come back stronger than ever.
More compassion than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans of New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in suit-tie stood at his feet to cheer him up.
“Military men and women are considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, the spring fundraiser’s organizer.
A senior military officer present at the gala, which also included Admiral Mike Mullen, chief of staff of the United States Armed Forces, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
“They were presented as some kind of orphan,” the senior military official wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have been established between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some military.
The public is acting more and more as if they are sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brig. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon be leaving for Afghanistan.
“But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves into the role of unlucky spirits.”
This is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not wish to appear unthankful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most conversations about pity take place confidentially among veterans.
After his two sons returned from battle with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would view their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect as they were confronted by insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if “an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who interviewed him asked subtly if he would be able to hold out under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after he returned from the fight.
"When you approach the subject of service, you are faced with negative impressions," Colonel Cancian recalls as he talks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely praised by a country so unfamiliar with the military and which sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as we did in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people largely focus on the depth of a soldier's suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of service periods, the number of friends lost, or the extent of injuries.
The military in the face of increasing pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a landmark hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go on trial against the military for alleged inaction over rapes.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
Private 1st Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claims to have been raped by a soldier.
It was October 2008, when she was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked her if he could join her in her room for a drink.
“It was a wake-up call,” says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texan has put aside its concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
Minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman’s room, the man grabbed her from behind, threw her to the ground and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and some not, will anxiously await a court decision in a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether a trial against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of not having stopped the generalization of rapes within the army, thus going against the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs. This number rose to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the military did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says she's going after the scrawled military, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
The lawyer also states that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future legal proceedings.
Her strategy: instead of bringing all the plaintiffs together in this case – thus putting all her eggs in the same basket – she will bring several lawsuits, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be pursued by soldiers on or off duty for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active duty personnel.
"The alleged harm is inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs," the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to battle, this distinction is only written on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely solely male.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in getting in touch with local women.
Out of these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives – two-thirds in combat.
It’s time for the military to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a case against the four major military academies for supposedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the Vietnam Veterans of America non-profit foundation is preparing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on diagnoses of “personality disorders” attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave – a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women’s Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims of benefits for people claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Department of Defense’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, because according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5 percent of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The March report also looks at the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20 percent of cases registered in the military were prosecuted – half the percentage of the civilian justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Susan Burke case describe their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell different police officers, doctors and commanders about her rape 11 times in detail.
She underwent a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and her attacker's blood - due to a cut to her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat in front of a judge at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six people testified as moral witnesses for the perpetrator, who eventually was acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was rendered,” Lyman said.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started screaming after court."
“I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I came out, I remember telling my commander, ‘It was not his trial but mine.’
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed on less than honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefit.
Will the Lyman case and the other plaintiffs move forward or not, that’s a long story, says John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington’s Faculty of Law.
However, he notes, “In my opinion, they should be able to move forward.”
Only this doctrine, which has been criticized since its introduction, stands between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and deterrents posed by accountability.
“The odds are heavy against them... but it’s important that they try,” he adds.
These things change only when the good ones have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other plaintiffs for further trials.
“We will continue to fight against the army on this issue as long as there is no reform,” she said.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
Walls have eyes: Researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy sharing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having been caught in a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was faced with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time prior to the attack on his computer, chatting with a few of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networking sites.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to find them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find the people they’re looking for with scientific accuracy – the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. They targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to take a survey. The questions asked were about their level of education, attitudes toward violence, and optimism about their own future.
By getting in touch with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without leaving the office.
“It’s a new way of doing research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young and anti-immigration.
But surprisingly, “those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens.”
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new go-to tool in the hands of scientists.
Focus groups, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all topics that affect health issues such as social trends, through "Likes", wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, the “data supernova” is generating a research explosion, increasing the number of research jobs whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people you could not approach on the street.
“Before, when you were trying to investigate people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You had to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you in,” says Jamie Bartlett.
“Facebook avoids all of this – you have direct access to their information.”
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social issues.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who talked on Facebook about their drunken exploits were enormously more likely to be alcoholics than discreet students about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that students’ colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would speak too often about alcohol.
“You can’t treat a problem if you don’t diagnose it,” Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle, says the Washington Post.
“We know how to identify children who are at risk, and who would not otherwise be recognized.”
Facebook also constantly accesses its users’ information.
The site’s data-driven team studied statistics regarding the love situation and Valentine’s Day, turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a national happiness index (thanks to the information only available – champions of digital freedom have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven’t even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is something else entirely online.
“I don’t think many users have ever thought about a researcher being able to study their profile,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the Knowledge Lab in London, according to a 2006 study he conducted while observing his students’ Facebook walls.
"As far as they knew, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user’s wall.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things,” Selwyn said.
That’s why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notebook and a pen are the best tools you can use.
“Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,” he says.
“Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect – and the social is not in front of a computer.”
"Froid and inhumane": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to staging the two bombings that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templars," he told a courtroom packed with 500 people.
“As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I reject it because you hold your mandate from organizations that support an ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I admit the facts but I don’t plead guilty.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he "did not want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, speak to the victims’ relatives at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for an additional 12 weeks, barred him from speaking to the media for four weeks, and warned him that authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to be sure he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhumane," a survivor of Utoya told Norway's NRK television.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally advanced a bit after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial, looking journalists and survivors in the eye as he walked in and out of court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a broad "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not insane, and said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The July 22 attacks therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the whole nation.
“I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but that’s not the case,” a relative of one victim said.
“It would have been much easier.”
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview at the Cinema This Week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford – distinguished by technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans may find most telling in a Steve Jobs interview recently found and which will be released this week in the first part of a film in the main markets, is how much this creative spirit had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a flowchart enhancer - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease that makes them think that a great idea does 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea from a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds", which traces the birth of the computer, and he sat down for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it had been about 10 years since Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies disappeared in the transport.
It was only after the death of Steve Jobs that a complete video was found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly edited, is the basis of the 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be screened in cinemas next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly excited to expose tech philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism resurfaces, where he seems eager to hear Cringely's questions, giving him elbows to make him accelerate and move on to questions or topics of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, we find a strangely prescient aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision on the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then implements them immediately.
Here is a quick recap of seven remarkable sequences from Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
“In all these years, I’ve always asked, ‘Why are you doing things?’ and the answers are constantly the same: ‘Oh, just because you have to do them.’”
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs goes on to detail his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how costs were recorded - one often starts with a "standard cost" assessed on a nose-eye view, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory that guaranteed the accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a trick at the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack telephone networks and make long-distance calls for free.
The device has been the subject of much prior writing, but Steve Jobs’ euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
“We would wrap the ball around different things half a dozen times and you’d scream into the public phone and it would happen to you a minute later on the public phone next door,” Jobs says with a laugh.
“We were young and through this Blue Box we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We didn't know much about each other, but we invented a little thing that could control big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have existed without it.
Steve Jobs goes on to tell a wonderful story that he and Wozniak developed: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go off in laughter just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love of technology (and Bill Hewlett's canvassing):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he looks for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and gives him a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP’s employees to visit the company’s research labs, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the “first desktop computer ever designed.”
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode ray tube, and I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was went back to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the Improvisation of Innovation:
Several times in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a whim.
Early in his career, as he settled down to sell a few circuit boards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working at only 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big fights... they yelled at me pretending it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that turned out to be incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that are running out of steam:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders would go wrong and lose control of their market share.
“Let’s say you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, and then what?”
You have a monopoly of the market, so the company is not more successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [it’s those types of people] who end up leading companies and product staff are being sidelined from decision making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can’t imagine designing a good product versus a bad product – the manual labor required.
This is what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire IT industry.
It could have been ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They won defeat to victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
“A huge amount of manual work separates a great idea from a great product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
Some things you can’t do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by putting them together.
Finally, decisions are made out of personal taste. It’s about trying to expose yourself to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring those things to the product you’re creating.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists steal.
We are always ashamed to steal great ideas.
That's part of what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply turned out to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas Dinner with Opponents of Health Law as Court Meets
On the day the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to consider the issue of political discord, whether opposition to President Obama’s health law will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case in the high court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One case involved a lawsuit by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5:30 is expected next March, and the result will probably be likely to promote the destabilization of the presidential race of 2012, which will be booming by the time the court decision is rendered.
The lawyer who will stand in court and argue about the law’s rejection will likely be Paul Clement, who served as Solicitor General of the United States during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement’s law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court conference on the case.
Among them was Mitch McConnell, top Republican in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of the health law.
The featured guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from a code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by Canon 4C’s code, which states: “A judge may attend fundraisers from law-related and other organizations although the judge may not be an intervenor, a guest of honor, or featured on the program of such an event.”
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the case’s law firms, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
“This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court abides by the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"Judges were drinking and dining and at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending in court."
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event demonstrates any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics claiming that they too easily mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas’s wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the solicitor general of the Obama administration when the first oppositions to the law were brought to the level of the court of first instance.
Her critics have been pushing for Kagan to recuse herself from hearing the case, saying she was too committed to defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records record $18 billion order for airliners
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle airliners, with the option to buy 20 more.
Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order contemplating 50 of its products.
However, it is quite a case when the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record sum of 18 billion dollars.
Equally amazing is who Boeing received this order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based airline estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth a total of $450 billion in the next 20 years.
Over the weekend, Boeing informed of the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle aircraft.
The Dubai-based airline Emirates placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total amount of the order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8s, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and amenities for passengers.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than a billion dollars.
“This is clearly very positive for Boeing,” Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
"These customers in particular have tremendous value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
So they not only have the means to pay for these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them since the country would earn money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the price of oil rises, Dihora reported.
“They have natural risk coverage,” he said.
Emirates’ order reinforces Boeing’s dominance in the widebody aircraft market and helps curb the attempt to encroach on competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the Airshow comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the debut of the largest version of the A350, which directly rivals the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is delaying its debut to increase the push following the demand of its customers to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's shares rose 1.5 percent to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister clearly beaten in Michoacon elections
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers helped her opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the run for governor.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister appears to have lost her bid to take over as governor of Michoacan in violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
Initial results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for governor of this western state.
“The intervention of organized crime during the entire voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacin but for the entire country,” Luisa Maria Calderon told the radio during an interview on Monday after the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election officers... They took the ballot boxes, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he is organizing his comeback, and a win in the Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood out only a little from Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate from his brother’s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the office of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential election for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any connection to drug traffickers and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacon to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence persisted.
A week before the elections, a PAN mayor was assassinated while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up campaigning locally out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the elections of Michoacan look, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging in view of next year."
ADB urges Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro zone emerge from the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term degrowth that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the chief executive of the Manila-based BASD, said the world’s two fastest-growing economic powers must “do everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) not to look at Europe’s difficulties with an “indifferent eye” and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe’s leaders and resources would avoid a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all together in this crisis.”
“Therefore anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
“Asia can be protected up to a point but it is not safe.”
"So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them."
In recent months, the eurozone has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing has skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe’s burgeoning sovereign debt crisis has raised fears that the global economy will go into recession, and prompted calls from major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Nag assumed that the IMF would channel any Asian aid, but also said that bilateral assistance – such as buying bonds from the US financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater negotiating power to Europe’s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade and industry minister, said “India will do everything it can” to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges ahead and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not a choice, it’s an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help Europe’s rich as they face their own important economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get Europe to accept aid from the 1.2 billion Indians, at least 800,000 of whom live on $2 a day or less.
“One day they will discover that the Greeks are retiring at 50 and going on vacation in the sun and they will have a hard time swallowing it,” he said.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Nag said the eurozone crisis could have "significant repercussions" across Asia.
BASD’s forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 now faces “risks of loss” due to the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop “relief plans” to protect themselves from economic downturns and large capital outflows.
Pentagon warns of potential defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta ratcheted up pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that impending automatic budget cuts would undermine national security, sparking a financial chain reaction from Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan’s battlefields and civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 or more in cuts will be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impacts of these cuts would be devastating to the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said the failure of Congress to reach a fiscal agreement resulting in what is known as sequestration, would result in 23 percent cuts as well as the freezing of many new projects.
“Such a significant reduction, applied in this way indiscriminately, would render most of our ships and construction projects unenforceable – you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or vessel – and seriously undermine other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote.
“We would also be forced to part with a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly have to send civilians on unpaid leave in order to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation.”
The cuts would eventually affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
“Although wartime funding of foreign contingency accounts is not directly affected by the sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by severe disruptions in core budgets,” Panetta warned.
“Contracting personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support the war.”
“Employees managing salaries would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defense.
“The consequence of sequestration on the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader in military power.”
“We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when Panetta’s letter was published.
“It’s not a consequence we can live with, and it’s certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves.”
“Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent warnings from senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly vocal about possible cuts, even though he himself has reached the top Pentagon post cumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing he was facing tough choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what might happen - a military with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don’t have enough trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission,” Panetta said in his opening remarks to the Pentagon.
“It’s a depressed force, ill-prepared and unable to face potential adversaries.”
"De facto, it invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically spelled out how further reductions could “generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limitations on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable assumed risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could be slashed, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new littoral combat ship, and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Ending the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its proponents say it is a critical step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines indicates just how pervasive deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies have destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner has come across as an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign financing violations related to coverage of an extramarital affair.
And then, none of those who have lived the story will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The accounts of cheating on school and university tests are legion.
There have been instances where teachers have given test responses to students in order to get a good look at their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should teach otherwise send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lie to each other three times in the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detecting or spotting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to exclaim: "I got you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research of such projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the findings of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars look you in the eye.
They don’t always stutter, blush, or stir.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, question formation, and response time.
I’ve spent several years examining scientific findings in the vast body and still emerging knowledge about deception, and it’s clear that deception detection is a modern skill that’s easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are skilled at reading others, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions, and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more lies "centered on them" while women tell more lies "centered on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but that the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is called "setting benchmarks".
This helps to provide a reference point for measuring subsequent changes.
Observe your subject’s posture, laughter, vocal quality.
You need to know if someone normally moves their feet constantly so as not to make unfair accusations when you see them moving their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for signs of verbal and non-verbal misleading behavior.
Think of these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceptive people can immobilize the upper body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet at the door, lean toward an exit, change posture significantly or present “post-interview” relief – an exaggerated sigh of relief, a posture change when all the difficult questions have passed.
Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is over just to seek to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson skidded using the past while claiming his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals may also use distant language: "I did not have sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wooden language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the response perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing the skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances of avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial pipeline plan to be diverted after U.S. threat of late approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a proposed pipeline between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico – angering unions while soothing environmentalists – the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the proposed pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department’s announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives new studies of potential routes to avoid areas of Nebraska’s dunes and the Ogallala aquifer, vast underground water sources.
“It’s a real way forward,” Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would likely have delayed any decision until 2013, after next year’s elections, although officials deny the policy’s involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s decision, and expressed his support for it.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to Texas refineries.
To do so, it would have to pass through six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are pushing for legislation to force the removal of the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only cause limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the department’s inspector general ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a Hillary Clinton campaign adviser in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle, thrown into a rampage of violence in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she vomited out of fear.
The tirade of the singer "Lady Marmalade" scared the little Geneviève Monk, 18 months old, to the point that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "the increased fear of strangers", says her family during the trial of the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was November 10 last year as stage technician Kevin Monk, his kindergarten teacher wife Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk went to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down into the lobby of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Genevieve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and posed her daughter for a while.
"Someone came behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and went to get her," she said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
“She said to me in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t leave your daughter near the door,’” says Roseanna Monk.
“I said, ‘What you say or think doesn’t interest me.’
She became enraged and started using swear words - the word "" and the word "" in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started sprinkling water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Genevieve became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who still held Geneviève in her arms - and had to be restrained by her entourage who dragged her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she began to vomit, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but got no response.
The lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return our calls for comment.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and the family plans to donate all the money received to a children’s cancer charity.
“The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct,” Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child."
Climate Adversity Has Slowed Down the Economy
During the first year of management of Mario Lopez Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has decreased and the economy has contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario Lopez Valdez, self-called of the change, which has generated great expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, apart from causing losses of trillions for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the Jelly Allocation Report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582 million 835 hectares have been damaged, of which 78.03 percent have suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent have suffered partial damage, the main crops affected have been vegetables, maize and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the rate of unemployment of the State during the first three trimesters of the year has been observed an accelerated increase, because while from January to March 55 thousand 053 sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Active Economic Population 9 in the second trimester the rate has become
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
“What we are seeing is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars in an illicit way it’s not easy that they work to earn them, that they invest them and use them in something,” he said.
Migration Detained
Lepez Cervantes pointed out that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
“The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad in the United States has been limited, first because of the difficulties of entry and second because by entering they already have a lot of difficulty to find work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which causes unemployment to rise,” he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the Sinaloan labour market worsens by considering the high level of lack of seriousness that prevails between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in this state works there without contributing as a worker at any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for the state’s lag is low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Work and Social Forecasting.
The average monthly income of Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, far below the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, in 2011 there was the largest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Economy Secretariat from January to June the State FDI reached 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the State Government records a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the State Government requested in July at the public congress the approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the objective of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 trillion pesos and until November the economy has seen no profit in the economy.
Reactions
For the representatives of the employer sector, the first year of the government of Mario Lopez Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the State Government.
"The performance of Sinaloa's economy during this year has been really poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have to align the effort of all and especially the good already synchronized progress of this new government team, let's hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo Lopez said events like the frosts at the beginning of the year held back the state’s economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, between which the frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not run fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations that we had," he says.
Redefining the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronate Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that one wants to channel the State towards productive activities of more dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we think it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and the economic direction of the state, because it is important that we devastate the full potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
A lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
“In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term programma,” he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to do," he said.
Sentenced for 8 kilos of marihuana
A person residing in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a 100-day fine for possessing eight kilos of marihuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic has informed that the small trafficker convicted is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for offense against health, in his variant possession of marihuana intended for sale.
In accordance with file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was travelling in a pick-up van, white in color, in which he carried a black bag in the luggage rack of the vehicle and in the place of the copilot a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated material has been made available to the Second Judge of the District and the convicted person is still in the Center for the Execution of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debts to contributions to books
Works of a social nature contemplated in programmes such as H bitat, Rescate de Espacios P blicos and 3x1 para migrants may not be finished or suffer serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda pointed out.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although construction programmes have so far progressed, they are at risk, as the State Government has not fulfilled its obligations to make contributions in excess of 11 million pesos in all three programmes.
He reported that in total, the investment of these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide the 25 percent and so far only the Federation and Municipium have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their finalization.
“They have to contribute $12 million and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end, they haven’t given us anything, even if since July they have to give us some of it,” he says, “and we, in order not to register any delays, started the works and we made a lot of progress, but we need the money.”
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration Municipe had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided on that occasion.
“We had already experienced this in the previous sexual period because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to operate and this year we, to be able to access these programs, had to get the resources to cover what the state had not paid,” he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had made the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the managements so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
“They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end, they haven’t given us anything.”
Court approves 'analogue cut' in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has rejected the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderon did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be followed to make the transition to digital terrestrial television a reality.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was rejected for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because the regulation of radio and television is an attribution reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
In favor of the project have voted only Zaldavar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and even Sanchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions provided for by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of the ministers also resolved to reject the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister Sanchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the minister president said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for it.
"I also do not consider that if he did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, whose constitutional mandate is the direction of the State.
The substitution of digital signals for analog signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years and is reflected in better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitalization that involves a decision of public interest that has not only a technical dimension, “because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues.”
These issues, he stressed, “require the operation of an entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, encompassing a group of attributions that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State”.
He recalled that a large number of countries from all over the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, has somehow invaded the sphere of competence of the Congress, for it ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws issued by the Legislature, he assured.
The possibility of a "vote-by-vote" countdown is analysed in Michoacan
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the governor election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacin, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this sense, the president of the General Council of the Michoacàn Electoral Institute (IEM), Maria de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, the past 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal reform in electoral matters.
It will be recalled that Michoacon did not ratify either his Political Constitution or his State Electoral Code or his Electoral Justice Law, at the same time that the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period for this electoral process to enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the deadlines provided by the Law of the Official State Journal, with a few objections.
On the same November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the representative of the state for constitutional reforms, because it has no right to "sanction or contest them".
Interviewed on the possibility of the "vote by vote", Maria de los Angeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to carry out the partial and total counts of the votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there are no minutes of voting and counting in the file of the ballot box is not found in the president of the latter; or there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total number of votes received in all the ballot boxes of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the candidate supposed to be the winner of the respective election and the one who obtained the second place in the ballot is equal or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the representative of the party and/or coalition that presented the second of the reported candidates.
The total number of votes may also be counted if, at the end of the joint tally, it appears that the difference between the candidate who is supposed to be the winner and that of the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express petition from the representative of the political party from which the candidate came second, in which case the electoral packages that were the subject of the partial count will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, confirms the family.
The remains of driver Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday towards night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a misse de requiem.
According to his family, the last wish of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes be spread in the Sierra de Zapalinamé.
After receiving the tributes alongside the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard an aircraft of the Mexican Air Forces, the closest attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant colonel arrived at the vigil chapel of Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends went.
At 17:30, he was presented with tributes to the Technological Institute of Saltillo organized by his former colleagues of technological baccalaureate and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was part when he was preparing for the baccalaureate.
“He wanted to go back to Saltillo and have his ashes spread in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, he always said that to his family and friends,” said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
For her, the lieutenant colonel had realized all his dreams, she considers that he was in the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and cared a lot for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés abandoned the city of Saltillo at a very young age to register at the Air College in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it, because they said he even had a bad truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagan to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopan for the graduation of his relative, for this he knows that his uncle is dying doing what he liked most in life: flying an aircraft.
His Last Farewell
With honors was said goodbye to the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, tribute that had at the head of the governor Jorge Torres L?pez, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Technological Institute of Saltillo, where he studied both in 1985 and in the distinguished sports.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, alongside the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people, all officials of this service.
The remains of the Saltillo-born pilot Bacio Cortés arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 hours to be handed over by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the group's esplanade, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and his other parents, students and masters.
Three abandoned corpses, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before they were found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found murdered with shots fired in different parts of the body and with the coup de grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
The discovery took place at kilometre 1.5 of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who have passed through this place have observed that in the property, whose fence has the color beige and coffee the portal was widely open.
Looking inside, approximately three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; at his side there was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
At one meter distance there was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying on their stomachs.
According to in-situ data, all three people were murdered in another location because in-situ casings were not found.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by one organized delinquency group towards the other, apart from a few bullet holes in this one and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defense made the presentation of 11 people, among whom a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to have a relationship with kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to the information published, in a first act on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and one was managed to save who had been deprived of liberty.
They confiscated three buildings and a cell phone; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another fact that took place on November 12 at 06:00 hours, military personnel made a surveillance course in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without license plate with two subjects on board.
By stopping them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a magazine and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on November 13 at 2:00 p.m. one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are credited with clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Teron, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put the entire Eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the government.
He is expected to present a cabinet made up of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present the president with the outcome of his conversations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," he said.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
“The framework is now well laid out,” he added.
Monti completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to levels impossible to sustain.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the trust in Italy that had been affected.
Stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability placed the 10-year yield on Italian construction bonds above 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: “We said we would support this government a lot.”
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success have been greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, to which the crisis forced him to resign last Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts will have a good result,” Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers’ groups and youth and women’s organizations on Monday.
He will finish his meeting tour Tuesday through the night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who empowered an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about the new prime minister’s success.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for Eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti said his Government should persist until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before advancing the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it must be trained only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spanish is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convenors participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 called by the two countries for today’s friendly, at 15:05 hours, at the San José National Stadium.
While the national and European champions, the number one in FIFA’s monthly rankings, count a large register of class A interselected games, the Habs only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have all 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fern?ndez.
Spanish footballers who play in the All-Star League and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain year-round intense activities in league and national cup championships and disputes in European cups like the Champions League.
To all this must be added the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated European Cup and World Cup qualifiers.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have international experience limited to an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the biggest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goalkeeper ’ker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international games.
Casillas will play against the Habs today and they will set a new record for Spain of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernandez, Barcelona's brainsman, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and Schalke's centre-forward, Raul Gonzalez, with 102.
Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc F?bregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Umana are the left-back J?nior D?az, with 48 appearances and the striker Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have overtaken the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and José Luis Lopez with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn’t even come to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolavar only has one and Elman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not start yet.
Spain's historic scorer is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to perform one of their best shows on Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream come true to perform in this country.
That's what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The band is in the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour and Sunday 20 will make its only stop in Central America.
That day will take place at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles group The X and the Las Robertas Nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Nacion on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will perform in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been grandiose.
I spent in Costa Rica only once the holidays; it is such a beautiful country and I think we will be able to spend a few days there.
We are excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity on the previous days.
What is your message to your most ardent followers?
Thank you for staying with us for all these years.
It took 21 years for us to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to pass until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve offered over the past 21 years have taken place in the last couple of weeks.
We offered a two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope it put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to performing there.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends always went surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to go surfing; that's how we learned it, through the people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you were offered huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never happened there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to perform two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the directory.
What do you owe it to?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can perform more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, which is why it’s very difficult to choose which songs to perform each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t performed in a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of why we loved those songs and may have forgotten about them.
It makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
In the first place, I don’t think any of us thought we were going to be a big rock band, and the fact that we’ve been doing it for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to share our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together is very exciting.
We love each other and we love creating music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't get any better for us.
What does it mean to you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group of great groups.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
This is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual.
From time to time, a group comes out of a city, but it’s much stranger when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the Seattle band.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to still be friends with all of them and it’s an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that popped up.
It’s also very strange that a group like yours will stand together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is much longer than many bands normally last.
First, I think we are all lucky to be alive, and second, we all care about each other.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give freedom to everyone to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t get any better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure we don’t spend too much time on tour because it’s easy to fall into this game of the great multitudes and people who love your music.
If we don’t forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect the music and what brought it, without thinking about the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which is not really interested in any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some good songs and at first it was great.
We've been a band for almost three years and we didn't release a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think of the amazing person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk to him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose him for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and this one was the band we liked the most, so we can’t wait to see what Las Robertas can offer live and it has to be very distracting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first that I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam keep the grunge up despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands that I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all of those that have popped up at the same time and, if that’s relevant now, I think it’s wonderful, because it’s a music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making the best music ever.
At first, his music had a more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What is this change?
It’s interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that look lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very obscure songs, even though these can sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there’s trauma in your life and you lose to a relative or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
I also think that you can be happy and even like that you can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical check-ups
Former president Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he presents in the magpies, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000) suffers from various ailments, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated on four times and which is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told Canal N Television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days in the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the remission of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, no doubt, he said that the latter does so because he feels innocent.
He has been operated on four times with tongue cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, a pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving time in the National Directorate of Special Operations since September 2007.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely during the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and made up of various ministers and bosses will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderon, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with political and commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of resident Uruguayans in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be "prophecy for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations," according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its web page.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when the French proxy, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay’s rejection and the call for consultations from its ambassador of this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world’s strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the “gri list” of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have had in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
Mustache plumber goes three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, untiringly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the young girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at stores all over the world, was designed from the start to make good use of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile system, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses,” said Nintendo’s Spain-based head of press, Omar Alvarez, during the video game’s presentation in Madrid.
"Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this medium", because so far hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman argued that, despite being in 3D, “Super Mario 3D Land” is an “accessible” video game that allows for a fast and smooth game play.
Alvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skillful users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second round" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This three-dimensional foray into Super Mario also assumes the character’s return to a mobile console, something that hasn’t happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo gives a nod to the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of success of the previous games, which consists in the fact that the mustached plumber must browse platforms mined with perils to free Princess Peach.
Even though I player find novelties in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom approves Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of $70 million.
Thus ends the trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the country of the north who demanded Portillo to judge him there.
In a press conference, Colom said that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his tenure “he did not help” in any judicial resolution and he had given effect to all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did involves an executive approach after exhausting all the judicial and constitutional bodies to try the former mandatary in the interval 2004-2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was absolute for embezzlement of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 youth at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The record of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is significant: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
Added to this is the long centenary of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping people with little training, no work, substance abuse problems or marginalisation.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of heads of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the electoral season, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Alongside the president of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor to the mayor and current eco-socialist municipal councillor Ricard Goma.
Also present in the grand hall of Fabra i Coats were the current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Llu's Cleries and the General Director of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and so is the current one, but added that the work done so far "is a good foundation".
The president gave Trinijove as an example to know how to fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-festivals, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments of the building, at Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance.
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of number 51 of Rue Balmes lived has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left at noon yesterday the building they occupied illegally and where they organized micro-festivals that despaired neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating itself.
"From that day there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited-, took away the electrical installation and part of that of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving there residues of all kinds, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass celebrations, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a disco, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied, her business dropped by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made it unfair jurisdiction, because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreation room had to respond to complaints from neighbors about the noise, while, according to her, the trouble was not caused by the guests of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irritated neighbors of the area.
The head of the disco explained that the troubles were so great that she even ended up in an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since he "forgives" him the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors for this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the town hall, Alberto Fernandez Diaz, had asked last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to finish with the problems of life in common and civics that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were flights too.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must end impunity and be relentless against the antisocial behavior generated in the property".
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police moved to number 35 Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the advisability of convening beyond the controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors once again opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already-extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed posters promoting Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orient itself on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a mega-competition composed of 16 contests for all access doors to Collserola.
A door leads back to the idea of a park, without a doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appears on its own: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization and in terms of the reflection on the city is a topic of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona.
This is almost a recurring theme that two members of this former caste of elected officials talk about when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is one of the few opinions on which coincided three Barcelona architects, university professors, who presented themselves there.
Miguel Roldon, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldon, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the green blocks has not been carried out.
"It is necessary to start from the base that the most extensive park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", the architect gave the verdict for which the title of "gates of Collserola" contains a "lexis trap": one should not think of these "like access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Modol, like Roldon and Bayona with experience in the urbanistic world, describes the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some perils".
Perils that derive from the "uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience lived in the 1980s and which had in the area of the Forum "its swan song".
The first fear is the delimitation of the boundaries on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already taking the next step," that is, going beyond it.
"We must think of new planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (MGP)] can cause authentic disasters."
By sticking more to the question, Modol opines that, by simplifying, the slope of the region El Valles de Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronate of Collserola that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers to his corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
Moreover, he hears that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe-conduct that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "doubts" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a whole success", he says) that one had to create: "We, the architects, should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because from the bases of the contest there is missing a global vision of Collserola: "One has convened 16 transversal contests - he says - in the direction mountain-sea, but there is not a longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This made, at least in this case, that he opted to participate in the 16 contests.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the next door.
In its opinion, yes, the town hall should guarantee that the band immediately superior to that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that makes a gentle transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonus Larrazobal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, Casino Red's legal representative granted the pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the lawsuit initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonus Larrazobal will be released after the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red grants him the pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jonus demanded the payment of an economic fee for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the mayor PANiste and on 2 September he was arrested and kept in provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Agent of the Public Ministry 3 of Patrimonial Offences, he was transferred to the Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he was given a second order of detention after the Public Prosecutor's Office officer dismissed the offences of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to the Cadereyta penal center allegedly for blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with a million and a half pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the medium security detention center as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial held in the municipal cells of San Nicols de los Garza.
On 25 October, a capture order was issued by the Registrar of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yenez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonus' guilt, such as that relating to the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing it to operate.
This Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, appeared before the judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the Public Prosecutor's Officer attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, interrogated Garcia Gomez if the damage had been recovered and who of the associates of the gambling house had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
According to case 197/2011, legal pardon is granted to Jonis Larrazobal and subsequently no claim can be made in relation to the lawsuit against him; he will not be asked for any compensation for damages and neither will he be punished.
After the hearing of the founder of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretan was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yunez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicol's de los Garza to inform Jon's office that he had been lawfully pardoned and that his file would be closed.
He will also inform him of the immediate order of liberty issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J?come gives details of the air crash in which lost his life the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and other seven people
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) informed that the results highlighted on the accident in which lost his life the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people, indicate that the helicopter shocked directly against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J?come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also advised that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met the requirements to transport personnel.
In addition, he said that investigations in the impact zone do not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact presented itself structurally.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The soil had a slope of seven to 30 degrees.
For now, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, General Manager of Airports and Auxiliary Services assured that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Major State was operating in speed of cruiser and this happened on a soft ground ascending.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruiser operation at the time of impact," he said.
During the press conference, TBS licensee Pérez J?come listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical standards, the flight was conducted according to the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM referred to adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft advanced to the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of cloudiness at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the cloudy conditions the crew searched for a lower height area and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
The location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remnants in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight and lateral path.
The aircraft's residual dispersion model suggests that the helicopter collided with the ground under structural integrity conditions.
Traces of fire or explosion were not detected:
At the scene of the accident there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of any type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above average sea level, the ground had a slope that went from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he possibly disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides evidence that suggests the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful searching in a larger area than the surrounding area around the accident, scattered parts of the aircraft were not found, which supports the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find the Obesity Gene
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is leading an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people, called protocol 'Génétique de l'obesité des enfants et adolescents' which will allow to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Investigation Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the National Medical Center of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Investigation and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
To the investigation is invited to participate the population entitled or not, to present themselves to the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the proofs are made to the minors every Saturday from 8:00 hours.
He pointed out that the protocol began in the Sports Unit Cuauhtémoc (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Sports Unit of Nezahualc?ylt (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the target of 500 or 600 miners, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sports Unit Morelos (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that to know the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify in Mexican children and youth risk factors to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on 14 November, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of the specific questionnaires relating to diet.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and history of family heredity of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that Saturdays will be applied to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, height, circumference of the waist), blood pressure, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (the aim is to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz Lopez pointed out that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
"The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 reported that in only six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 percent; in the case of overweight there was also a dramatic increase," stressed the specialist of the IMSS.
He said the rationale for searching for markers is based on the fact that the country’s population is different from others by its genetic history.
He informed that on average, Mexicans have a 65 percent Indo-American heredity, a 30 percent European and a five percent African and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity results in the inability to burn the excess energy that is consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the full assessment of the children, which makes it possible to detect if they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, and doctors give it in writing to parents, who are explained each of the measures and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking for short distances.
Another cause is high caloric intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamals - meat pâté with corn flour wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid blackcurrants
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better efficiency, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions.
If the indications that the pavement was resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand blackcurrants each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera N?jera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the asphalt pavement is adequate, the blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A Technological Opinion on Blackcurrants, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Najera felt that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the yield, and therefore, the formation of blackcurrants.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, of almost 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that on the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and compacted later.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he reported, is bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it generating effort, it allows the forces to propagate very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, it would spread better, opined the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt layer, he says, we put a last layer called the rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide grip on the street.
Being the part of the paver that receives and distributes the efforts, the rolling layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be neat.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as these significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer is it is difficult for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes blackcurrants.
In the process of forming a blackcurrant, he says, the first one that spoils is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be cured at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of blackcurrants and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be related to the load of vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent formation of blackcurrants.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and make it possible to repair blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramirez Serna not to obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle received her number 14 title as a princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atl?ntico was mounted with the crown and the sceptre, the department is already 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one to a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who found themselves near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, between which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dom?nguez Arena Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979),
Today the big question that many people are asking is:
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation demonstrated that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Pretty Face of Vogue, titles obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who won the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the juror's decision to appoint her as First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What was the book that marked you and why?" asked by Martin Murillo Gomez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer of the candidate of Valle to this question:
I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I believe that it is a form of culturalization, definitely I believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The little prince", it is a book quite deep.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The ardor of blood".
This answer did not please firstly because of the term "culturalize" and secondly to not explain concretely how each book cited had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, what must happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a big book.
Among the assumptions made is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogota insinuated that being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), "it awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she did not shine on the stage".
And that was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Even though at both shows she seemed sure of herself, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist with the RCN's "Como en casa" program, said the fact that Melina was named a princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the prizes during the competition does not receive the crown of queen".
In addition, Valle avoided the press in the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That’s why two days before the election, international juror Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to her country’s social needs.
“Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, that before starting the Competition are already involved in projects,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by her defects of her buttocks and the fibrosis that was observed in her abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens' trainer Jorge Hernan Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem with fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too notorious, left her points on the last day".
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the mistake of the candidate of Valle were the surgical operations that she had undergone.
"The surgeries are good, but Valle couldn't do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of that aspect.”
For this prize, which the National Beauty Contest presents for the first time, after the swimsuit parade came a cruel prediction that was fulfilled last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that today Melina begins a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not obtain the crown.
So was the work of Cali's person who identified Alfonso Cano's corpse
A typist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
In the past 4 November a typewriter of the CTI of Cali has made history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", by confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists who work in the CTI’s local offices, this week it was the “availability” trick of Eliazar Gonzalez, a Puerto Tejada man who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the municipalities of Choco, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the corpses were to be identified.
The year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after taking adequate courses, he specialized in typing, which is the study of the skin of friction, that is to say the palms and the feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano Eliazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that it was suspected that one of them was that of the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo Leon S?enz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the location of the corpse, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a local farmer, without glasses and much leaner.
But the fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a sampler and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzan that yes, he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a typist from Sijon de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar Gonzalez, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can be crucial in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, typists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured individuals.
When captured, many offenders present false ID cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher told that in one case of theft he had to remove a part of the wall of a house, because in this place the thief had pressed his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not adequate areas to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in different thefts,” he recalls.
Fingerprints can also rule out or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently a dead man was found, with bottles of drink around him.
Through investigation it was determined that a relative may be a suspect in the crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if it does not guarantee that he is the murderer, it puts him on the scene of the crime.
A CTI typist explained that "fingerprints of objects are extracted with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a sampler or strip is used to collect them.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of declines, or to the National Civil Registry.
“The problem is that there are still a lot of undocumented Colombians,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is how one shows in the CSI television program.
As everything that shines is not gold, everything you touch does not necessarily become an imprint.
It can be used, however, if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The "indignant" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters jostled in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part of the people acceded to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement defied New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, thanks to a court order, instead of Manhattan, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters were scrambling in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a judicial order that allows the "undigned" to camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will move to another place and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful protests,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the response of the “outraged” to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'undigned' occupied a new park at the confluence of the Canal Street and Sixth Avenue power plants, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church Parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some protesters, even though Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization claims that there are hundreds of people who have settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved in support of the members of the movement and tried to intervene on their behalf before the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a private property enclosure - remains closed pending the holding of a judicial hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analysed.
A few displaced protesters were carrying and distributing copies of the court order at that time and even handing it over to officers who were monitoring the square, which caused “some small clashes,” said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating members of Occupy Wall Street or enforcing “laws published after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with tents or other properties they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, but warned that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councilor personally defended the early morning evacuation at Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the protesters were “violating the law”.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the square because it became “a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to harm other people,” because “some stores had received threats” and residents were afraid “for their quality of life.”
“This morning’s early morning evacuation was repulsive and demonstrates that basically Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers,” added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of “not respecting freedom of expression.”
“Occupy Wall Street” officials also said they do not plan to hold “big actions” for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Next to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen’s assistant in “Home Improvement,” first-aider in “Baywatch,” bunny in “Playboy,” wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, alongside "crooner" Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed footage from the television program in which Anderson, also known for the extensive Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her then-husband, the drummer of "M?tley Cr?e", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting in a crib a doll that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian Indian-born comedian who recently featured a part of Charlie Sheen’s “My Violent Torpedo of Truth,” appears as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special also features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is himself not far from the controversies.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian's "whore" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Reborn After Earthquake
GDP rises 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, recovering from the devastating earthquake that became the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in Japan since the Second World War.
Initial estimates by the Tokyo government have calculated the material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, gross domestic product data between July and September were used to definitively turn the page: GDP rose 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rates.
That recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - assumes, in addition, the largest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is due, in part, to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital spending observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, use deficiencies to grow from zero.
Japan has woken up mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable rose 1%, driven by higher spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "safe haven values" elected by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the troubled U.S. forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger divide, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of major technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, made responsible for their weak results between July and September the contribution of the yen.
While markets continue to be headquartered in peripheral EU countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government does not let down its guard.
“We need to keep track of the risks that remain, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, secretary of state for economic policy.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that the majority of member countries presented clearer signals of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are held back.
As it dropped four decimals to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone was even below average, which is in the 100 level, n dropping eight decimals to 99.13 points.
Athens is fueling doubts again
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but Conservatives won’t sign any written pledges
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to tangled up in the maze that leads to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is being imposed rather by the demands of Brussels than by a real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period established in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the date.
“The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit of October 26,” Papadimos said when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras no’s message casts doubt on his position: “We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are not committed to anything more.”
The conservative leader has gone a step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the bodies that must unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make the adjustments.
But the European Commission, irritated by the impact of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not release aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the inspectors of the troika would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth installment" of 8,000 million, even if there is no definitive date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofia: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stresses the "preponderant" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a leading position at the global level in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled that the country has become in the last two decades the second largest donor of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the 5th World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very especially, in the one that aims to reduce to half the volume of people who live with incomes under one dollar a day, to which is fixed the "threshold of poverty".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofàa, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originated during the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have “achieved a lot of goals” and “we face a lot of challenges”.
The Microcredit Summit is envisaged not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to push "two basic goals".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The impetus in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an “admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty”, the work of which she has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know on the ground its policy of loans.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I could see a continuous evolution", explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the qualification of "head of family" gathered in Valladolid from the "banker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez warned that solidarity “is an ethical imperative” for any democratic state.
In this sense, she explained that it would be a mistake to vinculate cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, because this is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits presuppose "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to people "excluded to whom everyone closes the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially foreseen in the program but was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the activists who consider the government's policy too lax vis-à-vis the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which, at the end of their speeches, Angela Merkel and then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schaeuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The guiding principle of the Chancellor - and of the motion - is a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty that would strengthen the European Union’s control over the budgetary policies of euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage “in order to give a face to Europe”.
This is in any case one of the motions adopted by the congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schaeuble.
Admittedly, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the milestone has been set.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weight each country to the European Central Bank’s Executive Board according to the weight of each economy, which obviously amounted to increasing Germany’s weight.
Eager to appease the climate within her party, the chancellor has multiplied references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but she has also not sought to win her congress on the backs of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty quick to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the hollow.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is sick leave fraud?
After the allocations, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux to visit a family allowance fund, and deliver a speech on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and the assistantship.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to save money in a context of rigor, but is no less indicative of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.
First, for the purpose of budget savings: the government plans to impose on private employees a fourth day of deficiency before taking charge of a stoppage of work.
In other words, without a specific company agreement, an employee who becomes ill would lose four days’ salary, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks generating anger, but that would bring 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic in scope: to impose on civil servants a day of absence without compensation in the event of a stoppage of work (they have so far no waiting period, against three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority is also relaunching the topic of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.
"The controls are going to be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will reimburse," warned Xavier Bertrand on RTL's microphone, Sunday, November 13.
As with other cases, the advertising effects appear to be somewhat disproportionate to the reality of work stoppage fraud.
Since 2002, it has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, in 2008 daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure, with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% were for maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% were for sick leave, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
That’s 2.5% of health care spending.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides certain gaps: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any sick days.
Another study, this time from Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to a month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more prone to work stoppages than elsewhere.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (whether for health reasons or not) varied between 10% and 11% in France, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick leave fraud represents very little in the face of black work.
As for fraud, it only reaches a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 carried out for short-term stops were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of arrests of more than 45 days, systematically monitored, there were 11% of "inadapted or unjustified" cases out of 1.2 million, or 132,000.
In total, therefore 169 000 "unjustified" cases, out of several million employees who have had a sick leave.
A figure that represents very little compared, for example, to that of work in the dark.
According to MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud to the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment program to get its economy back on track.
That is what the Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, told Parliament on Monday, adding that the 100 days given to his unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
“In order to continue the recovery efforts of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new fiscal adjustment program,” said the head of government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro zone summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro zone "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Papademos has forecast that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after having been 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects New Austerity Measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, on Monday gave his support to the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity.
“We will not vote in favour of any new measures,” he said at a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
He agreed with the deficit and debt reduction targets, and the fight against waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the 8 billion euro loan needed without a written guarantee from all the parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says expert committee
Canadians live in denial of death, says Royal Society of Canada report
When it comes to palliative care, the committee is calling for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk with their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of a major report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
From the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has spawned a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death.”
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, report the experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
Despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, the rate is highest in Quebec, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on non-competent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, said yesterday in a teleconference that more cases of these excesses would be found precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” Downie said.
Canadians Support Euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favor of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering, according to a survey Angus Reid conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
For those who have been involved in assisted suicide, 41% said they should not be prosecuted.
In terms of maintaining or discontinuing care with a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Expert Panel also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect a refusal of care at the end of life, without fear of criminal prosecution.
When it comes to palliative care, the committee is calling for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee asks that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the report of the Royal Society of Canada experts.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described the position of the experts who signed the report as "extreme", among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to the terminally ill.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and is over 18 could ask for help to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report.
Mr. Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
“In society,” he says, “there are markers and constraints.”
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed “strong opposition” to the report’s findings, which she called a “pro-euthanasia protest.”
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, specifically challenges the report’s data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, namely the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's king calls on President Assad to step down
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Bashar al-Assad’s Syria, which, with the support of Russia, resists them and denounces a “conspiracy” against the country.
Two days after the Arab League suspended Syria, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, took a stand in favor of President Assad’s departure.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “leave power” in Syria where some 40 civilians and regime forces were still killed.
“If Bashar had his country’s interest at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,” Jordan’s king said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, lamented that the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country to which Turkey is adopting an increasingly harsh line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a “strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the regime” in Syria, after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have perished in Syria’s southern Deraa region, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians were killed "in exchange of fire and shelling with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country was "moving towards the end of the crisis".
He also strongly reacted to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said was a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not bend", he added, assuring that "the plots against Syria will fail".
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now considering a “protection of civilians mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said he was in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s repression, which he said is locked in “paranoia”.
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on November 2 and including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the throes of protest and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, but refrained from supporting any sanctions against Damascus.

Monti asks for time in the markets and sacrifices to the Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today with trade unions and employers.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet made up of technocrats outside Parliament.
“Monti spoke about an important program with a lot of sacrifices,” said Francesco Nucara, a deputy from one of the many small parliamentary groups engaged in the talks, after meeting with the president of the Council-designate.
The president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, for his part, said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a short list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are definite deadlines" to prepare a government and its program, he said, saying "certain that the markets will be patient and understand".
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern has regained the upper hand especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro zone in September.
The prime minister-designate should form a team that includes mostly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics."
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Once he took office, Mr Monti pledged to work urgently and with the aim of making Italy a "protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not reach its goal of a balanced budget in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for new austerity measures.
Italian "boss boss" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth can not meet the deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, because Italy must place by April 2012 for 200 billion euros of government bonds.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used with a nuclear weapon, a U.S. atomic risk NGO said on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA last week expressed “serious concerns” about a “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS drawing heavily on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, worked for three decades from the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Urals), and was allegedly involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then reportedly cooperated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA cites “strong indications that Iran’s development” of a nuclear detonation system “was aided by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but who, as a member state has informed the Agency, has worked for most of his career on this technology within his home country’s military nuclear program.”
Anti-Muslim crimes and offenses increased by 50%
Crimes and misdemeanors against Muslims increased by nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence declined slightly or little, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence perpetrated against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase, against a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in offences against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and offenses.
The total number of “hate crimes” increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by differences in religion, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and misdemeanors increase again,” Human Rights First said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious human rights violation,” said Paul Legendre, one of the organization’s officials.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses,” he said, adding that it could involve improving police reporting on “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the civil rights era.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now gender.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter introduced Monday changes in the presentation of its platform, to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another "name" make it possible to follow more clearly, live the activity of other "Twitters", the Internet users whose messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they are forwarding messages, subscribing to new accounts, having favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, said Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to repost a message from someone else, followfriday to recommend following another user) making insiders happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the mainstream networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users were debating with “tweets” on the importance of this innovation.
“It’s pointless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” wrote the post.
“The Activity feature will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter feed,” sent the tweet.
Austria
A “Golden Rule” in the Constitution
Austria's ruling Social Democratic/Christian Democrat grand coalition government on Tuesday decided to include a budget "golden rule" in the constitution to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible deterioration by the rating agencies of Austria's sovereign rating (triple A).
It was Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of a Council of Ministers, while Austria's public debt is 74.6%, well above the criterion of 60% maximum set by the Maastricht Treaty, but significantly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were lowered by just one notch, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an extra three billion euros in interest every year,” said Michael Spindelegger, vice-chancellor and Christian Democrat foreign minister.
Austria is following up on a request from the summit in Brussels of the euro zone member countries on 26 October: the heads of state and government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The system adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, as of 2017, the federal government’s structural public deficit will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The aim is to raise public debt to 60% by 2020/21, as set out in the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen Fort
Noda threatens a new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue rising.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose not far from the historical levels that pushed the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
That day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency which had just set a new record of strength since 1945 against the greenback.
But the yen has risen steadily since, boosted by purchases from investors who consider it a “safe haven” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was raised Tuesday below 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic mark of 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was priced at around 120 yen and the euro at over 160 yen.
This surge in the Japanese currency hurts the archipelago's exports because it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of income from abroad by Japanese firms, when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11 that devastated the region of Tohoku (north-east), said Noda who fears that this increase in the yen will kill in the bud the fragile recovery.
The world’s third-largest economy returned to growth in the third quarter – 1.5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and household consumption hit by the disaster.
But the prime minister said the yen’s high price did not reflect “Japan’s economic fundamentals.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which on Tuesday opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate action", hinting that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros), raising the ceiling of the amounts it spends on purchases of various financial securities to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
The rates are rising, the stock markets are falling
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is still undermining European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in fragile countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro zone, the European stock markets are sinking a little more into negative territory, this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10am, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
Dax in Frankfurt sells 0.4% and London 0.1%.
“With new tensions on the bond yields of struggling eurozone states, equity markets around the world continue to return some of their recent gains.”
"Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, in turn suffering renewed fears from market participants about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eye on Europe and trade will continue in a narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro zone penalizes the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
At around 10am, the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, it backed down after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, that of Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the countries of the South, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of the speakers.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has asked the markets for time to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro zone summit on October 27 would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the line of sight of the markets, while on Sunday are held legislative elections in the country.
The spread between Germany and Spain’s 10-year bonds has reached a new all-time high.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
On the statistical side, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected, driven by household consumption.
However, INSEE downgraded the figure for the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And, it is really the fourth that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the entire euro area is expected at 11am, as the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas.
If there is one subject that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is indeed energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is healthy that an election meeting is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place that nuclear power holds.
The debate will be fruitful only if it explores the full economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic change will lead to a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to overcome the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity permanently, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight against climate disruption, a subject that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case for Belgium, which submits its own to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor for Switzerland, which just intends to build only the latest generation of power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but a few, are pursuing their projects with determination.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add a unit to its fleet by resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the accident at Three Mile Island.
If the German model, focused on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality thwarts the discourse.
The choice of Berlin will result in higher electricity prices, an energy dependence aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, especially from Russia, a jump in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these unfortunate effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is worth pondering.
European champion of wind power, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas because of the intermittent wind; under which, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Therefore, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would lead to a sharp increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory the beautiful declarations on the reindustrialisation of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not show a principled opposition to this energy, the polls show.
Recall that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it trains a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and makes them very creator of non-relocatable jobs.
If France were to decide to get out of nuclear power, it would be sacrificing many of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros a year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miracle electricity generation, any more than there is a diabolical one.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a safety authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing power plants as well as on the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession of safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
At Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the tragedy.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
The result of this approach and cooperation between the French and German safety authorities, operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians wishing to build a power plant, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by giving them the freeway to seize the leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such a decisive debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - overcrowding of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has been the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of May 23) proclaiming in passing that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant waiters".
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic perspective.
There is a fairly broad consensus on this issue between the left and the right.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on both left and right.
For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that we will deign to give to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confines himself to banalities, indicating that co-development will solve our “migration problem”.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be paying electorally; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book synthesizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among scholars on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration anaemia growth and harms employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they risk replacing domestic workers, especially the low-skilled, who are putting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, working for the most part in job-scarce sectors.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic workers, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors in which training does not match the supply of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants mean that immigrant arrivals have a positive effect on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages in the long term.
This does not take into account the fact that the diversity provided by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, averaging 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to public budgets on average over his entire life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to look for the missing growth points “with teeth”.
The teeth in question, by serving to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, European democracy remains to be thought
Democracy is a precious good; it is also a fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, knew throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have thought that it would be enough, for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct manner possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little", that this was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become an "instrument of oppression" as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first and foremost a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinodia of the true-false Greek referendum will have had in this respect the value of two revelations: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic combat have now shifted, and that, for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to the needs and in a dispersed order.
A white-sign to the absolute European monarch or a leap with feet joined in the void of nationalist withdrawal: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want to cutlets but a common, full-fledged, serene and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - there is no longer any way to stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that bows to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
There are concerns about sovereignty transfers to Europe - but it is Europe as a whole that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the steering of the European project.
Because it is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After having long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic government.
All right.
But to think of it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must assume a new stage of European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The revolution in interests was not enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a more politically democratic Europe, a genuine European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
"Contactless" smart cards are becoming more common
The global smart card show opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 should indeed end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card ...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the firm Eurosmart.
The most promising segment is that of contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or pay for your purchases by simply approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa credit cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double bites.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards.
To move to the next level, banks must now equip their customers.
“Two major French institutions have committed to systematically distributing contactless credit cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, Visa Europe France’s Chief Executive Officer.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices today are equipped with the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology essential to carry out transactions.
“They were late.”
"But they should finally see a real boom next year."
“We expect 80 to 120 million units to be sold worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payment.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale, too, said yesterday that it was preparing to put on the market an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is worried about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Suspected for a long time, the links between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
"The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation," he said.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two French nationals in Niger last January would have uncovered bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their captors during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerien investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
The Terrorist Axis
The analysis of past calls points to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has spent a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram and the other to a man who claims to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a step forward, but we must probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between AQIM and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these “supports” had been increasingly evident in Boko Haram’s evolution and discourses, or in its modus operandi, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices that are increasingly complex and of the same quality as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore pressured Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illuminants unworthy of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in Hausa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict respect for sharia while its militants engage in the fight against the impious central government.
The latter are aimed first of all at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active, multiplying attacks against police stations.
The reaction of Abuja is, as usual, without nuances.
The army invades the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
From then on, the sect would become radicalized and leave its northern strongholds.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it was again in Abuja that Boko Haram attacked the secure headquarters of the police during a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia via Nigeria now worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi has taken over Mali and Niger, as Somalis from al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready "to share all the intelligence".
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete for simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
Over the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been ramping up their thunderous foreign policy statements and shortcuts, traditionally a Republican hot spot.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans – often unsupported – are flying.
Mitt Romney, who is best placed in the race to appoint the “Great Old Party,” has threatened to drag the Chinese to the WTO and implicate them “for manipulating their currency,” a promising theme in an America exasperated by the migration of swathes of its industry to Asia.
So much the worse if it involves the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, nearly strangled himself in the face of an attitude that “flattering” emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the image of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
“If I am elected, I will stop Iran,” he boasted.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.”
He also vowed to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, displays an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is “trying to develop a nuclear capability” – seemingly unaware of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the U.S. military in Mexico against the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the Republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president reply that Reagan too had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine when it came to anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, on his procrastinations in Libya, thus labeling him as weak.
But the attack is not so easy.
The public is rather positive about Obama’s national security record, which eliminated bin Laden.
From Iraq, it is wary of military interventions that lead to stagnation.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which connects Western Europe directly to Russia by passing through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It must supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brilliance.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine buffet, at the inauguration of the Nord Stream, this new gas pipeline that directly connects, under the sea, Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned the wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the West European network.
With this new gas pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe via a first 1,224 km tube connecting the St. Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube is to be completed at the end of 2012, delivering a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third on the same course.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction site looks like a victory.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries are losing a little of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland, in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained a greater security of its supplies.
But this is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily consuming gas and whose deposits are in decline.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," confirmed François Fillon when inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating how the major gas contracts are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the wide smiles displayed by Gazprom executives, present in large numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of steel sheathed with concrete in order to protect it from the anchors of the ships.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution," said Jens M?ller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to multiply measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which nothing interrupts along its entire length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off Sweden, but project officials gave it up while the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state-owned company permanently establish itself off their coasts.
"In case of damage, we stop the passage of gas in less than a minute," says Jens Muller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by manufacturers who have planned the welds to experience a leak every 100,000 years.
The condition of the pipeline is monitored by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus that circulates inside the pipeline.
From the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, one meter wide in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters second, it delivers accurate information on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without having to undergo any repairs.
The flow of gas is simply ensured by the pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which retains 51% of the shares.
Joining them were Germany’s E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Netherlands’ Gasunie and France’s GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have set up a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire gas transmission capacity to the company for 20 renewable years.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,” says Jens Muller.
30% of the financing for the construction of the pipeline was provided by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to recoup their costs, since only Gazprom bears the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that arrives, before it is transferred to German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created fifteen years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a off-white color, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a notebook of design but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, took care of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin which refers to a varnished cotton used to cover benches for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has brought back to life an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces sold.
It is far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to draw up a robot portrait of the buyer, because the notebook appeals to the businessman, the student and the professionals alike.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now has almost 100 employees and since 2008 has two offices; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from Fnac to small downtown shops and has been able to impose her identity.
“We followed the times and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails,” says Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products: bags, agenda, pens, computer covers ... The brand is available on a whole range of supports.
In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people opens today.
Despite a proactive public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the general population.
Discouraging?
“No,” says Eric Blanchet, executive director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people.
"The progress made over the past fifteen years is considerable."
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher.”
“However, there is still a lot to do.”
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, there are still many obstacles before accessing employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the baccalaureate and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to an average of 38%.
In short, these are all criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to work, and that "constitute the crux of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
Here are the objective brakes.
There remains the unsaid, the mentalities that evolve, certainly, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité indicated that the managers interviewed have "a low level of knowledge of disability", with an "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, psychic or intellectual disabilities ".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set out in a law of... 1987.
The latest figures, which date back to 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
“We are now around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The proof: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "Only happiness"
Before facing the Blues on Tuesday evening (8:45 pm) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that gives them this friendly match.
We will not go so far as to write that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace.
Five months after his attacker's move against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise to do about him.
“I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian.”
"I want to move forward," said Le Lillois.
As for the contract between his performances in club and in selection, "it's a whole, he justified himself."
“In Lille, I’m there all year round, which is not the case with Belgium.”
“I have to take my marks.”
Held against Romania on Friday night in preparation for this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
Without forgetting the notion of "pleasure".
Les Bleus, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been supportive,” he says.
Of course, this contributes to further strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
Especially as opposite, "there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
"We met a little while ago."
“To be able to play against them is nothing but happiness!”
With good humour, Leekens spoke of "pride".
"Pride" to play "a gala match".
"Proud" also to note - as a "neighbor" - that France has "returned to a team of very high level" a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a job of thunder," he said.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would see the plane shared with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are getting big,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You will realize this in the next matches", the one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Paulo Bento’s Portugal starts with a lot of optimism its return playoff against Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the end, both teams lacked realism.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, which he has been in control of since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a game to be played, and an opponent, Bosnia, to be knocked down.
After the first leg (0-0), Friday in Zenica's inferno, it seems obvious that the games are not done.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but it was unable to score that precious goal, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we didn't score a goal on the outside."
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as hot, even if the game obviously promises to be "very tight", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
“We expect a very close match, but we are quite confident that we can take over,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We continue to have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012,” said Queiroz’s successor.
The draw reported Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
“It’s a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we didn’t score a goal on the outside,” Bento said.
“We’re going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put as much pressure on the Bosnians as possible in order not to “give them time to think.”
A good idea, as long as you are realistic this time.
