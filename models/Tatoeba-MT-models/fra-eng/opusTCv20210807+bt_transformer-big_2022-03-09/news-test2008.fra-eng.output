Inflation in Europe has slipped on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the price increase in the 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, after an inflation rate of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 percent was recorded, said the European Community's statistics office located in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., U.K. and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the key interest rate by saying that falling interest rates, along with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, this is Catch 22 for the ECB: "we must deter" inflation so that we no longer have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a record over the past twelve years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Cereal futures market ratings increased by 88 percent and soybean prices also reached their highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price rose 52 percent, and last month, a barrel of black gold cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, over the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut the key interest rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) has increased significantly at the beginning of December, with the largest number of supporters since 2002, while Gallup (Survey Institute) has never seen such a low level of socialist support, i.e. 13 percent.
For loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of opposition voters, a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of one-fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent throughout the population.
On loyal voters certain to go and vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate from the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly serious has never been higher, it stands at 41 percent and according to 46 percent complementary the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of last spring and summer, families are once again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population anticipates a worsening and only a tenth anticipates an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of those surveyed, a majority never seen in Gallup’s previous polls, said the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of the respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsny while 38 percent support Viktor Orban.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society that thinks that discontent with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change in government.
While after the riots last October, 35 per cent of respondents wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, currently this rate is only 20 per cent, with the relative majority (33 per cent) believing that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
When asked about the intention to vote, 60 per cent of respondents said they would certainly vote and the additional 20 per cent said they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 percent of respondents would certainly participate and another 15 percent would probably participate.
74 percent of people would say no to higher education tuition, 79 percent would say no to consulting fees, and 84 percent would say no to hospital fees.
When we look only at the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters respectively would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital fees.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by nearly twenty percent
The hypermarkets located in the commercial triangle of Buda?rs maintained the average price increase of 16 percent from last year, with the difference that this year the VAT rate has not increased.
Article by Napi Gazdasag (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budars, the usual daily Christmas Basket also increased by 16 percent on average, a value increase well over a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, “which had already soared” in major grocery stores last December, have not risen sharply compared to the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The Daily Basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded by 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value in the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
Prices of Unicum and live fish have remained at almost the same level as last year, however prices of turkey fillet, walnut and poppy have risen sharply.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread of one kilo was found at 139 forints only.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was amazing to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the returnable two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the returnable bottle included.
However, this year, in terms of Daily Basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its Daily Basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased it by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
Comparing last year’s most expensive shopping cart with this year’s cheapest shopping cart, we see a gap of 12 percent while the difference between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive shopping cart is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices rose by an average of 1,206 forints, knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noticed in last year’s Christmas prices.
This process has puzzled trade, hypermarkets could not visibly determine what margin to apply on products as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the turnover of a product, he risks losing a big profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
As a result of the change in the VAT rate, the price increase in the Daily Basket has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than the value of 2006 when the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the value of the most expensive basket was 1,630 forints higher than last year and the prices of the cheapest one increased by 1,284 forints as well.
By approaching the two Christmas seasons, we have seen a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer items have increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: for some basic supplies, the statistics institute found a price increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to the Daily Basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by barely more than 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to get multinationals to accept the sudden increase in prices as well.
In the commercial golden triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
Based on our experience, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long shelf life foods in pallets.
On Wednesday morning important queues were formed at the checkouts of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to the survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer items.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been registered in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork of medical staff do not help to block infections, says the chief doctor of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals are also saving on disinfectants
Not long ago, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of Jonos Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected in a man hospitalized following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured man in a serious car accident left the hospital, but soon after he had to return because of an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to perform a major operation on him because of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10, this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multidrug-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Borcz, chief medical officer of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Namely that it is the number of infections caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
A third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without it developing a disease.
Infections caused by AS (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a bacterium that is well resistant to antibiotics and will proliferate quickly in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, on elderly, small weight or with a weakened body.
According to the head doctor of the hospital, there is nothing special in MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
We must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only where we do not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
“These patients are isolated, the healthcare staff put on rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, however the infection can not always be avoided.
Sample collection is not in fashion
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSAs could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not favourable to prevent the development and proliferation of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Borecz.
As this infection is most prevalent in hospitals and seniors' residences, hospitals should monitor inpatients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these examinations.
Most cases only emerge if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief medical officer of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian guidelines also for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, in other words microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in ambulatory and basic care, Karolina Boercz said.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks, but important gaps are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact; however, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in terms of epidemic, the patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, are saving on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many sick people, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Barcz.
In hospitals where preventive measures are followed, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenses for social security funds, which is why this infection is being combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections are showing a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has identified the prevention of the incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (such as MRSA) as one of its priorities, as well as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The commissioner, who had a fatal accident, was not intoxicated.
The official report of the fatal accident caused by the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement has been drawn up.
It can be ruled out that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, resigning from his post since, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have driven in a state of drunkenness or dizzy, said Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Public Ministry of the capital after the relative observation has been established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation, which has already found that the former commissioner did not consume alcohol before driving.
Last Tuesday, the former chief of the police station of the 22nd arrondissement crashed a 55-year-old man who was in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, in the street Kossuth Lajos of the 22nd arrondissement.
(Indeed, the fact that it crossed the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not a mitigating circumstance, according to the Highway Traffic Act a car that starts a turn must allow pedestrians to pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Following this accident, the commissioner resigned his post and he asked for his retirement because, according to the police communication, this accident upset him a lot.
The investigation into this case is being carried out by the Prosecutor's Office in Budapest.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates in charge of conducting the investigation.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
On Friday, Hungarian Finance Minister Jonos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements worth a total of 400 million euros for a line of credit to support education, transport infrastructure and the environment, as well as energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environment projects to be implemented from the Cohesion Fund, for which the parties have already signed a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million, this time for the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also concerns the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, with the remaining EUR 150 million to be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a 50 million euro contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope in the first place as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the Metro Line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would re-discuss the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary has finalized the details of the funding of the metro with the EU.
According to Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans at the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without a commitment fee.
Bulgaria, paradise of the EU real estate market
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of all Europe is turned to this Balkan country little mentioned in the past.
What, or who bought in this EU market which is always the cheapest but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most fashionable target of Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and cheap seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albéna, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the old Sozopol and Nessebar but they are more and more looking for a building in the area of Kavarna and Balcik too.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also more and more to buy in the very cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, with retail and office spaces promising the highest amortization rate.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer season and winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are at the same time looking to change their lives, their way of life.
Most of the buyers are English but others are coming from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the edge of the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who intend to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or old dilapidated houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, proximity to a big city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of second homes (since last December, Bulgaria is listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving medium- or long-term capital gains.
The price of buildings in the capital is constantly increasing due to an increasing demand.
In the European Union, property prices are the lowest in Bulgaria; however, in the last 5 years they have risen by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian Six Percent
According to the statement by Environment and Water Minister Gobor Fodor, the meetings of the professionals will end on Tuesday, however, Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which is supposed to define the efforts to be made after the period of reduction of emissions defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, there are intense discussions on this subject between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, it did not want to discuss exact figures, while it was ready to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent from 1990 levels until 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries commit themselves, apart from emission reductions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to be provided to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board, probably under the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF), Piac es Profit (Market and Profit).
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of the Environment and Waters Gobor Fodor confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as flagship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the successful signing of the “Post-2012 Agreement”, and is ready to reduce them by up to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries are also ready to make commitments that are appropriate to their responsibility and capacity.
Fodor recalled that in 1997, the countries that signed the Kyoto Protocol had targeted a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members at that time made the commitment 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfill its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within the interval of two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments of reduction below the values provided for in the Kyoto protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system of emission reduction whose need was emphasized in the new report of IPCC, the international body responsible for climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase of the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees celcius could no longer be avoided which, according to the scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
UK army recruits on YouTube
British Army units are sharing footage from their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on the video-sharing site in an effort to make themselves popular.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) is passionate about YouTube: special units operating in Afghanistan upload video footage of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC said.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are checked at the Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and they are then transferred to London where the compatriots load them onto the Internet.
The political message is inescapable
Air force soldiers have already spent 139 sequences on the net by this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence signed up as the "Defencehead Quarters" in the spring of 2007 and released videos about operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were spent on the net to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to inform the general public of the real objectives of the army's presence abroad.
The propaganda published in this way costs virtually nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, told the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, defence consultant, but it also inevitably carries a political message since it justifies in a special form the validity of military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game.
The army is bothered because, apart from the videos composed and censored carefully, amateur videos are passed on the sharing site which also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the “official” propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
By the way, many videos had already been made on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out on real missions, but the British army has only recently been racing for the loading of these videos.
The Americans do the recruiting a little differently by using the shooting game America's Army for free. In this game the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers as part of a simulation more or less real.
Christmas raffles and donuts in ministries
Labour Minister M?nika Lamperth does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by taking donuts and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a party with live music, yet another will enchant officials with a raffle and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so the power is entertained.
Public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defense but it is not the employees of the ministry who will be invited.
At Christmas, Orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The ministry is planning a budget of 25 million forints to create the end-of-year atmosphere.
In comparison with the other ministries, the National Development Agency (NF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, out of the roughly six hundred employees, three hundred and fifty are expected to attend.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be de rigueur, there will be actors and also a raffle.
The Christmas of the NFA cost 4,700,000 forints and was held on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (ILO) building with concerts and dinner.
Renting the room cost a million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NF is invited to another Christmas party which is organized with European money by the National Center for Economic Development, company managing the calls for tenders.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté was rented for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt as we were unable to contact the person in charge.
The costume is not mandatory.
The ILO building not only hosted the NF, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, held a ball on the occasion of St. Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
This ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's welcoming words and the dinner was followed by a dance party with live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the evening dress was not at all mandatory at this ball.
The ministries of health, labour and local authorities are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, within its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labour, Munika Lamperth, does not officially invite her employees to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected who will be invited to have coffee and eat donuts, the press service said, so the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his collaborators to have a drink in the aula of the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (MoF) will hold a Christmas party in its main hall, where 436 employees are expected.
He plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Every year since the arrival of Jonos Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas in the same way.
No party atmosphere planned, the official character is reinforced not only by the presentation of the minister but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will hold a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in City Wood, and according to the ministry’s communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started by a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, the respective press services have communicated to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party held at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega-strike are gathering
The trade unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will constitute, Friday, their strike commission which will be responsible for coordinating the strike for an indefinite period of Monday.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the law on health funds, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant traffic jams because rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and the employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 1pm.
The unions of the league will make known, Friday afternoon, the details of their strike Monday, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The strike commission of LIGA - MOSZ will also be constituted, it will serve as coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and, from Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work indefinitely if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the law on health funds, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the law on health insurance funds, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the next step.
According to Monday's agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the law on health funds will take place only late at night, or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, important traffic jams are planned: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volon companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half the road will be blocked as well.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for strikes, the list of which is constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some organizations report going on strike for an indefinite period, others have declared a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the MV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) failed to reach an agreement on minimum services, but as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are taking the train.
According to the current communications, Budapest public transport will strike from the start of service until 1pm, Budapest airport between 7am and 9am, the Industrial Electricity and Thermal Energy Unions of the League will strike for four hours, the Teachers’ Union and the Democratic Teachers’ Union have called to strike for 2 hours and from 2am to 8am respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country alternately, the Health and Social Workers Union (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, made by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new conception to social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating retirement to be introduced from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third demand is for a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, which would make it possible to bring into the system the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), attached to the Unions of the League, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning the secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased country risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysis Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, set up last August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarorszegert Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increases, in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risk warning”, the company points out that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that “in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes can occur following the aggravation of the already existing ethnic tension between the gypsy and non-gypsy population of Hungary”.
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard’s political strategy likely aimed at provoking this situation is the main reason for this.
As they say, this is due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: “public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groups who have based a political strategy on the dispute between Gypsies and Hungarians”.
The problem is compounded, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened, and aggressive conflict is more likely to occur, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the effect of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially regarding confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following greater publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and far-right groups since autumn 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 calling themselves the "National Association of Self-Defense".
“The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their members for defense missions (catastrophes, national defense, defense of order), armed if necessary, moreover, by evoking the incapacity of the police, the army, in other words the state,” they added.
They pointed out that everything happened according to the method which, based on the resentment of the political and party society, seeks to disguise different political ambitions under a civilian aspect.
The emphasis on civility and association status therefore serves only to avoid the legal pitfalls of registering these associations in court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis points out that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbourhood relations.
“In recent months, many neighboring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a source of potential risk, and ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighboring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policies by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous Roma disturbances that broke out in a neighbourhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) led to the formation of the Bulgarian Guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the BNU decided to form a guard by saying that the objective of the organization is “national self-defense”.
According to them, for the last 17 years, the gypsies have “terrorized” Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement of some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the establishment of their own guard as a form of resistance points to the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, the risk warning of Political Capital reads.
At the request of the telegraph agency, Attila Juhusz, research director of Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the days of celebration and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
Holidays are not uniform in the EU and the US either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes between national and state holidays as well as rest days.
Rest days are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the New Year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that the revelers can rest quietly.
In one year, we have a total of eleven holidays marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, commemorating the 1848 revolution, as is October 23 which is also the 1956 revolution memorial day.
On August 20th, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1st is Labor Day and on November 1st and 2nd, we remember our family members and friends who have passed away.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely falling on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in a special regulation on the days of replacement before or after the holidays.
The law extends to all employers and to all their employees, to civil servants and to persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service societies, to institutions operating without interruption and in service, because of their vocation, and also for days of rest.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life stops almost all over the country because according to experiences the majority of people do rather overtime or take holidays that they have saved for these purposes to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in workdays compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized for the first time around Labor Day to allow employees to stay at home four days in a row.
Saturday 25 April will be a working day to have a day off on Friday 2 May.
Another change is scheduled for October 23: Saturday, October 18 will be a working day replacing Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will have a non-stop break even if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.
Six Futile Things That Can Hurt Colleagues Terriblely
Emails we forget to send, voicemails we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost more: these are things that “beautify” the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether one gets used to these troubles or takes up the challenge and consciously avoids ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
“Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing department,” a colleague told you.
That you missed a date?
At best he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, it is arranged with excuses.
Before having painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and to make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There is nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk but it disappeared the next morning?
Do you accidentally find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don’t take anything from your colleagues without asking, otherwise they are right to be angry with you for having stung their property.
Don’t bring envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there are no more and you need them right away.
Do you care about the privacy of your colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop spreading gossip.
Who did what, with whom?
Where and why?
Don’t tell everyone your information (suppositions) about your colleagues’ privacy!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Bury in you the information shared and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you sick for no good reason?
When you call the office and declare yourself ill under the pretext of a tearing headache because you feel bad or you feel that you need rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent business, your future missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you are not going to work or that something may happen that would force you to stay at home, do not forget to tell your boss and your colleagues to avoid that they are surprised by your absence the next day.
Sneering, sneering, phone
Do you dive into your work but the sneer of your colleagues pulls you out of it brutally?
Did you unwittingly become a witness to a phone conversation you had better not listen to?
Don’t disturb your colleagues with humming, chanting, talking aloud (that you lead over their head), kicking, talking loudly, or displeasure.
They can disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the deadline, you forget to send a mail or an important message, do not accuse anyone for this forgetfulness!
Don’t blame it on the possible chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you have made a mistake and if it has presented disadvantages for others, repair the fault!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix the negligence!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Putting a jog and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Do not put on a comfortable jog even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by putting on pretty and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to live up to expectations, you’re no longer interesting.
We move slowly in the usual morning cap.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with which electronic effects are associated.
I'll turn up the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass comes to accompany the tones of earlier, then a female choir comes to join it as a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts Zagar's song Wings of Love.
Hungarian musical life has not spoiled us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the cork is different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground are gradually starting to change the overall picture and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing up the guitar, Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Baluzs Zsager arrived from Pécs and played himself in Yonderboi's band before he set out on his own path, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to be known when he was entrusted with the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The season of Ferenc T?r?k).
The band initially playing in small clubs began to be known to a larger audience when wan2 magazine cited their 2002 debut album among the fifty most important records on the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, along with Yonderboi, the almost sole creators of the Hungarian trend who would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his ensemble became undeniably trendy, but no one asked them if they would wear that label.
The band reacted appropriately and released a new and better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, can open new avenues for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years spent at Pécs.
This is because it was a line of the old Pécs group of Balazs Zs-ger.
We are well there with the reference to the flight but next to the aerial music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of rock and roll.
Gyorgy Ligeti, singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the premiere of the album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real hit for the radio, mr2 Pet?fi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to night, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well (?).
hvg.hu asked questions of Balazs Zserger.
hvg.hu: This new tube pushes me to ask a question: has your music remained a music aimed at a certain layer?
The term “music aimed at a certain layer” doesn’t tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
So-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere too.
The attitude of reception works in this spirit also regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audience, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
People go to concerts and not only young people in their twenties but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes that have occurred in light music because they think that it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I’m obviously glad to see that more and more people come to our concerts.
We never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal, but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is more important at concerts where mutual influence already works but it is perceived only in the elusive changes of the moment.
However, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you would no longer be interesting.
hvg.hu: Will you follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and has had a career in the West.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path even if sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who trust each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, it was inevitable that our music would be compared to Yonderboi’s because many of us left his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love is in first place on the mr2 Petofi chart.
Many have heard Zagar’s name for the first time in this song.
With this more popular style you consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to make a tube to be able to sell the record.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the finale of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the six-member choir, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Eniko Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was then called Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little bit?
Zs.B.: This track had been around for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing from this song.
The string of chords attracted the voice of the song.
I sang that same night the melody that the girls learned later.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice she would not have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert also it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for a brief Judy Jay solo), they do not have a role alone, they all sing together and they do not sing louder than the music, so the music does not only accompany their singing.
They were behind the stage too.
Is that what you wanted?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we have to forget our ego a little, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let those wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to also feel that euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which song made you work the most?
Zs.B.: Truth be told, none as to the process of creating music, we had more difficult pieces when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything came together like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What’s your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I have already “dropped” this record.
These are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The treacherous trader risks billions because of his inferiority complex
A cover-up fraudster.
Its former employee is the French giant Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komeron.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros to him.
However, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, in addition, can not be considered as incapable.
Unlike all major banking houses, it recognized in time the crisis of the US mortgage market.
“He’s fragile,” his superiors said, who reported him to the police.
However, if we stick to the deposition of Kerviel reported by the French media, including Le Monde, the transactions of this man produced at the end of last year a profit of 1.6 billion euros.
The crisis overtakes the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the American crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Reports began to emerge in February that so-called “sub-prime” mortgages, granted to low-income clients or those who had experienced repayment difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he bet well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
“As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn’t know how to announce it,” Kerviel says, adding that he has, of course, kept nothing to himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he confesses to having distorted the reports so as not to be tracked.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex stock exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who risks nothing has nothing
Was he afraid of being discovered?
Rather no.
"I felt that just getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where does his willingness to risk so big come from?
He only came to his post gradually.
He started working at Société Générale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant trader and in 2005 he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
He knew he would never win as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the others.
Given my academic background and my professional and personal background," Kerviel told investigators.
However, shortly after taking office, he achieved his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz shares, he earned half a billion euros by betting on the decline of this title during the attacks in London.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you in peace
“It was like a snowball effect,” he told police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they suspected it.
"As long as I won, they were pretending to close their eyes."
This is where the blow from the beginning of the year comes in.
He lost a billion dollars in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer an employee of the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros to him.
And how did we find out?
He became suspicious because of his vacation.
“Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another,” concludes Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to get 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit from the largest share, up to $150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will be the source of an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund which will manage next year a sum of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, must be used to obtain financial means to encourage innovation within the company.
Companies should obtain financial means for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new more efficient management methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds.
Court upholds 20-year prison sentence for former Nicaraguan president
Nicaragua’s Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld the 20-year prison sentence for former country president Arnold Alemon, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for a $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion kroner) fraud.
However, he was later released and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be incarcerated again is for the moment, according to the AP agency, unclear.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison officers, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or go to prison again.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemon regularly moved government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These were shell companies and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and closest supporters.
A portion of that money went into the funds that Aleman had created to fund his election campaign in 2001.
We have adopted the budget
That's the way it is.
The state budget was adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year was passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - SSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and SSD could not afford its refusal.
Contrary to the heated debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies passed without any problem this law which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
Like it or not, every chapter and every article is the beginning and the end of every government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, although hidden behind the competition of power between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
The arguments of politicians are of much more interest to public opinion than the steep figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three evils which the present budget is not able to solve at the same time:
The first is the large share of the costs of mandates imposed by the law, constituted not only by pensions, but also by social security contributions, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" grouping the parties SSD and KS-M.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the greatest hazard.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued dizzy bonds, disproportionately indebted to their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from money from taxes, tax duties and bank loans, new sources of investment.
In past years, they managed to repay these debts through the mass sale of the shares of the distribution systems, especially those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatizations.
They no longer have that source.
If we look only at the official and verifiable facts, we can see that:
Our economy has been going through a phase of growth for several years now, as has the rest of the world, and there is no lack of sales.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were becoming more and more indebted to the state.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable manner than our republic.
This is a monstrous shame that falls mainly on previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least threatened by poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes, which have unfortunately been unnecessarily swollen in recent years.
Although some of the absurd populist spending approved last year before the election has been successfully phased out, if a pension age limit shift and pension reform are not forthcoming, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and whoever is in power will only administer it.
Hardly exaggerating, it can be said that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
This is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism by which ordinary expenses are pushed back by the costs of mandates.
The $70 billion deficit projected for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not dissipated all the money they could.
If we really do not want the politicians in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile coalition of governments, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it manages to levy in taxes and taxes, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will make it possible to achieve progressively a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight together the financial market crisis.
More than one hundred billion dollars will be placed in the money markets through auctions.
Banks will have to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will auction $40 billion and, in addition, it will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of individual states have decided on such a concerted action, aimed at preventing or even reducing the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," writes in his report to clients Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
“The concerted action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to outstanding loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further losses in the billions.
“If central banks have chosen this approach, it is because they must really understand what can still follow,” said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he adds.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The central banks made this choice after they failed to lower the London interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that the banks were still afraid of mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the U.S., Canadian and British central banks had repeatedly lowered their interest rates during the fall.
“This will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the approach of the Central Banks will help to avert the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
President Klaus: the debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change is expected to affect developing countries in particular.
President Vaclav Klaus has once again spoken out on the issue of global warming.
Criticism this time came at the United Nations international conference on climate change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric accompanying it and the reality.
“The debate is not structured at all, it’s just a rocket of words, ersatz solutions to current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, during the presentation of his book, that his subject matter is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
From now on, interested people can read their positions without them being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless has, in his opinion, enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academician able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The major conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following: the climate is constantly changing, the changes in it are therefore normal, there is no opinion shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of the current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they therefore represent no danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence the evolution of the climate are useless, ineffective and unacceptable expensive.
Especially since he has the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against a fundamentalist environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this subject two months ago, at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to renew their driving licenses on time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their old driver’s license whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day that people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities will be able to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid licence will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving license, especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While the municipalities report a drop in the number of applications for renewal of the permit, the authorities in the capital are flooded with applications and the number of applications for renewal of the permit has increased this week.
The Town Hall satisfies about 2000 customers per day.
There's a tail about half an hour long.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licenses.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request delivery within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Drivers of vehicles who will not be able to carry out the mandatory renewal of the driver's licence by the end of the year and will take the road without a valid licence, will be at risk, as of January, a fine.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence through an amicable process.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2,500 kroner.
According to old information, was liable to a fine even a person who was not going to circulate.
In doing so she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1,000 kroner.
According to Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka, there is no risk of fines in the tens of thousands.
The driver's license is, he says, a document that people can decide whether they want to have it or not.
It is not like with the identity card, which must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer want to drive should give their driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driver's licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Individuals with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Court has reduced the penalties of the detective tapes with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Kozauk, accused of colluding with David Berdych’s gang, will be sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
The Supreme Court of Prague has thus definitively sentenced them by reducing their sentences by 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Initially, the detective devices of the Department for the Fight against Organized Crime risked sentences of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment handed down today, only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is currently awaiting a trial verdict.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials exceeding 16 years in prison.
He cannot receive more.
In January, the Departmental Court found 19 people guilty of participation in hold-ups, the Superior Court was now dealing with the appeals interjections of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants questioned the prosecution since the beginning of the investigation, claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, the members of the police, after an agreement with Berdych among others, transmitted to the criminals information from police sources, covered the various hold-ups and helped the gang members to avoid criminal responsibility.
In return, the gang gave 30 percent of the larceny to Opava and Kocauk.
The prosecution refers to the gang's criminal activity in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robberies whose victims have, in most cases, suffered serious damage to health, but also abuse of power by a public official and prohibited armaments.
During the house searches, the police discovered illegally detained pistols, shells with a steel core, a sight for laser direct fire or a machine gun.
According to the accusations, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly 20 men in the trial, the courts have already found Berdych and a number of others guilty of other robberies.
Other men from the Berdych neighborhood are still explaining themselves before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing has avoided, for the time being, the current detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child substitution: 12 million
The lawyer for the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants to get compensation from the hospital in T?eb? for 12 million kroner plus the costs.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of the hospital Ond?ej Dost?l absolutely does not agree with the proposal of Veleba.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very, very high," Dostul said at the end of the hearing.
“To be able to form an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party has commissioned the drafting of.
We will check if it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to believe that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands,” Dostol said.
The amount should, according to him, be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 K? for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablov's family asked for a million crowns for each month she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the university hospital in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better supported by men, although they were faced with remorse for not being able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, remain less serene in the face of the experience of trauma in the news and what is happening precisely at the moment, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the hospital in T?eb? on December 9.
Last week, the children went back to their biological parents - Nikola at the home of the Kermuks in Paibyslavice and Veronika at Libor Broi and Jaroslava Trojanovi in Jabloov.
At the end of October, the governor of the region, Vysosina Milos Vystroil, gave to each of the families 100,000 kroner for the reimbursement of the expenses caused by the error of the hospital of Tsebus managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are required by law to have liability insurance.
In case of default, they must draw from the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask the manager for help.
Until now the courts have recognized relatively small compensations, the sums calculated from the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polovka lost Vala?ské Kr?lovstv? (Kingdom of Vala?sko)
Bolek Polovka has lost the dispute over the trademark Valaske Krslovstv (Kingdom of Valasko).
According to the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, it was indeed he who had used for the first time the title King of Valasko, but the project was set up by the team around Tomo Harabi, former collaborator of the actor.
Polovka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabio and his team are interfering with the popularity of Bolek Polovka," Polovka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valasko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comic.
Harabi is of the same opinion.
“We have a job of almost 10 years behind us.
Looking for money and setting up events,” he said.
According to him, it is money that is the cause of the dispute.
“After years, they realized that the project is successful and they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to interfere with our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polovka who first used the title valasko krul (King of Valasko) in his TV show.
Radoslav Brzobohat was crowned king in 1993.
However, at the time, this had nothing to do with the project of setting up a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabic came up with the idea of issuing passports of the Valauske Krulovstv.
From a humorous action originally came a business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabio, of the company Valaske Krslovstv.
In 1997 Polovka agreed to have his name and signature mentioned in the passport and even offered to the holders balances on the price of visiting his farm and his theatre shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabic has only used the naked idea, published by Polavka in the show Mané, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polovka has certainly helped the project Valaske Krlovstv, "said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabi and his team, who were dedicated to the project in an intense way.
Collaboration between the now-enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabia organized an official coronation for Polavka in Vsetan.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polovka and Harabi, which culminated with the deposition of "King Boleslav the first elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabia, assumed by singer Jarmila ulakova as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polovka filed a complaint against Harabia and his company, which the court today rejected.
What might clear the case is the tournament being considered for the throne and half of the princess.
There should be a new king.
He did not want to betray the details and the date.
“We don’t want to go fast.
it would be something like the parade of kings in Slovacko.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr. Polovka can of course register," Harabii added.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
I have never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the change of speed, the driving and also that of the manufacture could, in many ways, be qualified as inferior to the average.
However, there is currently on the market its successor the Peugeot 207 which is significantly better.
Especially since the combi named SW goes one step further, I just have to think better.
When I was testing the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback I was complaining about, for example, headroom on the back seats.
While there finished the complaints because the bodysuit means that even the great devils will, in this regard, be comfortable.
Let's see soon done
I will mention the inside very quickly so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only comment being about the central tunnel which seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the days when you could complain about seats or too short backs are over.
The lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to the 206 model.
As for the space, the increase in body dimensions is noticeable there too.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the already mentioned head disappear.
A safe in the safe
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate this one as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear pivoting ice) and a rather easy stowage.
Blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold quite heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
The latter makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is compared to the competition a rather average figure.
Apart from the .koda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle of this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mlada Boleslav product, we see that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on holiday abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I were to highlight the benefits, I would mention the underbody left after the rear seat backs were flipped perfectly straight, or a very low step.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, this is what a 1.6 should look like that makes a family hatchback work.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Skoda which often gives the impression of having an exhaust pipe clogged by a mop, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's go through the tariffs
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a car quite well equipped, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a 1.4-litre Otto engine amounting to 329,900 K is still fair.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410,900 K, which is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 K.
However, in addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automatic control of the rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle ultimately costs 531 900 K.
That's a lot, but try to add to the price of the Fabia additional equipment and you will get a very similar figure.
All that remains is to choose the brand.
Integration of Slovak students into British schools is not going well
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing concern among those who remain about the evolution of local education.
For the time being, the integration of Eastern Europeans faces a series of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of Kent in the north, where the conflict between the remaining and immigrants of Slovak origin is beginning to grow, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The arguments, the chicane and the fights between the students have transposed into the relations between the parents.
The situation went so far that police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who was beating a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends himself by claiming that the boy had insulted him with racist remarks.
Police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
“When we were coming home, a young man climbed onto the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he replied with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks,” described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One resident went so far as to describe conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above testify that the atmosphere in British schools between natives and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your vacation can come true if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering you on the beach pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will find this list not only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the repository and transshipment point for the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who had it built, since everything that was a crime in the United States (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50's of the last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojamar he had his yacht.
Show business stars and politicians across America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your own autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since the jigoulis and fiats once imported have already long ago, in a climate so salty and humid, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is noticeably decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity are there as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the province Holguin, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had been re-entered from the extensive sugar plantations on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how we can see running small locomotives whose contemporaries are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to direct your steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most famous places.
So there is no need to write a lot about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Viàles Valley on the west side of the island.
Exuberant vegetation grows there on calcareous soil.
Mogotes, calcareous balloons, and rocks rise in candlelight from the bottom of the valley, and, from the fertile earth being caught in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetal carpet.
The valley is where the best quality Cuban tobacco is probably grown.
You can meet the final shape of this product if you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
Someone might also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was shot.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought him fame and wealth.
The richness was embodied in the beauty and the city-window character of this small city.
Koloni-ln-e-pan-lsk-architektura,v-razn-e-ovlivn-n-e-pozd-j-mi francouzsk-mi osadn-ky, se za ty-i stalet-e-tém-nose-m-nila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is such a remote place that even in the 50's of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay on the sidelines.
We didn’t build anything, and that’s why we didn’t demolish anything either, everyone just had a roof over their head.
If you have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is worth visiting some interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancon or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Musica which comes alive after sunset and where the music does not become dull until the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village located in the extreme east of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads that lead there from Guantanamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without marks of human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed the Eastern Pitfall of Cuba, thanks to its unspoiled landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in reality, it was born about a hundred years after Columbus' journey) and from the hill where the old castle stands and the current hotel El Castillo, we see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Sows and Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this one could fill a quantity of pages.
As they say, it’s better to see it once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, say Americans
The lack of troops and necessary equipment, according to the United States, affects the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as it should, agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing opposition from the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are now also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States this week called through Defense Minister Robert Gates for NATO troops to be more active, Britain sees strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and stepping up development aid as a priority.
“The evolution in Afghanistan is noticeable, but military might can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
Afghan insurgent activity is, according to U.S. military data, the most intense in the past five years.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 percent compared to last year, up to 60 percent in Helmand province, located in the south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of them in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
“We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months there have also been conflicts between the countries involved over whether all the allies in Afghanistan are actually doing their utmost.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat requirements they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate,” Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan idlers discovered: Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild counterattacked by publishing a photo of a British troop during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State Debt Will Rise to a Trillion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding 84,000 kroner falls on each Czech.
Total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
As a result of better-than-expected changes in the savings from the state budget, the department reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion kroner.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion kroner.
During the nine months of this year it has therefore increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
However, from June onwards, it has fallen by 13.4 billion kroner.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on the state debt dating back to early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 kroner falls on each Czech Republic.
Over the past year, the state has been in debt for more than 111 billion kroner.
"For now, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit forecast for next year, we could exceed the border by a trillion kroner only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and 1 trillion kroner," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
The forecast of Next Finance analyst Vladimor Pikor is similar: "We could exceed the trillion in the course of 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene is changing, that policies are ready to save more, the date could be pushed back to 2010.
But I don’t expect that change,” he said.
Debts are growing
The debt of the State is constituted by the debts of the central government and it is generated essentially by the accumulation of the deficits of the State budget.
The state debt is financed by treasury bills, annuity bonds, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt of the State has increased this year from 38.5 billion crowns to 719.4 billion crowns.
The external debt of the state has increased this year for the time being from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The debt of the so-called negotiable state reached at the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average debt liability of the state amounted to 6.5 years.
“Total debt increased interannually from the first to the third half of the year by 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a figure far too high.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by pension securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be something to negotiate when the pension reform comes,” commented the data Pikora.
Better than expected
It follows from the strategy of financing and managing the state debt for the year 2007 that the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a better-than-expected evolution of the state budget savings, the Ministry reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion kroner.
The sum is essentially constituted by the deficit of the state budget which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the 91.3 billion crowns initially planned.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state pension securities for 43 billion crowns and the repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to 1.8 billion crowns.
She appeared in court today in Khartoum for naming a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The Briton was accused of letting students between the ages of 6 and 7 give the name Muhammad to a teddy bear while any depiction of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was sentenced to lashes.
The 54-year-old British schoolteacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and sedition, under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asked her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of the children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the classroom, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the caption “My name is Mohamed”.
The bear itself bore no label with that name, but the problem is simply that of portraying the prophet as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that might be offensive to a religious faith, “I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name”, according to him it is only an “innocent mistake”.
Many of the school’s students describe her as “very attentive to her students” and “who never talks about religion in the classroom.”
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Great Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
For example, can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Kosovo Albanians wrapped up a sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning without being able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger told a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake”, his US counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“We do not anticipate violence immediately but we are entering a very difficult period,” he added, noting that “obvious tensions exist”.
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province populated by 90% Albanian speakers could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Kharchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final round of negotiations since the troika was tasked with a new UN mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation to end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Botsane-Kharchenko said.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, the West believes that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
“Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached,” said Fatmir Sejdiu, the president of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, in the hotel in Baden where the “last-chance negotiations” have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovar rebellion and future premier of the province, expressed regret.
But he added that Belgrade’s autonomy plan “belongs to a past that has led to killings and deportations.”
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still possible, warning Kosovo's Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade says it fears a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
“For Serbia,” he said, “this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should go exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally has veto power.
“The Kosovo parliament will have the last word.”
“Only a solution in the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the Kosovo parliament will have the final say on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian speakers would be "in consultation" with the West.
Bush pulls out an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference he convened Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin negotiations to find a final settlement to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its settlement activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the “roadmap” for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim “to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including core issues.”
This name covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be “comprehensive and thorough” and address all aspects of a settlement, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others.”
In turn, Olmert pledged that the upcoming talks would be "direct and continuous" and would make "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set a deadline for the implementation of his Palestinian and Israeli "vision of two states" that coexist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had secured a commitment to that effect from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was a success for Washington, was at the origin of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that offered Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it tackles the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in an interview with the Arabic-language daily.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always in this type of fact various, official versions and rumors oppose.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was driving Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., on rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in intervention but on patrol, and was travelling at 40-50 km / h, without a light," said a police source.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawazaki, “not approved, therefore not allowed to circulate on the public road” (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was circulating “at a very fast pace”.
“She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority on the right,” said a police officer.
The blood alcohol test carried out on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (before smashed, star windshield, bumper ripped off) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "facts of manslaughter and non-assistance to anyone in danger" to the IGPN, co-seized with the departmental direction of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation of the IGPN, at this stage, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday night, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-motorcycle arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the friction of the footholds on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled while the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the place very quickly, thus not lending help to the two young people.
The GIPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out “any serious misconduct” on this point.
“This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation, on which you have to be very careful,” a police source said.
Libération met an eyewitness to those moments that followed the accident.
One of its windows giving precisely on the stage.
“We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them,” said the witness.
There was nothing to do.”
He then saw “a completely haggard policeman, who was limping.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken in a car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to this witness, the rescue arrived “about twenty minutes after the departure of the police”.
They also performed heart massages in vain.
“I will not let it be said that the police did not assist young people.
These young people were rescued.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tension is rising in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday cracked down on the first protests since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against measures taken under the state of emergency were injured by tear gas canisters used by law enforcement officials, according to witnesses.
They retaliated by throwing stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers charged and injured lawyers.
Several would have been arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers for the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced protests, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other demonstrations reportedly took place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers’ movement on Monday garnered support from religious parties in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president “urged the population to send flowers to judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and detritus to those who took the oath before Musharraf.”
"Musharraf's promise no longer holds."
Pakistan’s Supreme Court is directly affected by the emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, it was expected to decide on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election to the presidency on 6 October, by indirect suffrage.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been ousted and replaced.
“Everything we see is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president "no longer stands" after the establishment of the state of emergency, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said Monday.
Abandoning his military uniform was expected by November 15, the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also denied insistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf has been placed under house arrest by his deputy army chief.
More than one-third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) are not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or the IUD still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates INED.
The liberalization of contraception has still allowed a better “fecundity control”, according to the institute which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women between 20 and 44 years old has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated at the month for a couple in five and if possible in spring, season considered as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates on the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours of work in space to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, essential to the station's scientific activities.
A risky outing that has accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools “crafted” by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday as the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a large cylindrical part in charge of soon to host the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of docking platform for laboratory modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew's second task was to move a 17.5-ton solar module already on the ISS to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the redeployment of the solar panels of the module which have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And this is where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged for almost a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment was stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally scheduled to perform a shuttle control exit and then repair another solar panel with a faulty rotation system, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go after the 30 meters of length of the remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very adroit, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this doctor was therefore instructed to “operate” the “wounded” solar panel.
After specifically inspecting the damage, he severed the offending cable and installed some sort of "splints" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker near the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey cane wrapped in insulation to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "crafted" by the astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was fully deployed before taking inventory of his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts were enjoying a half day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts return to the shuttle Discovery for a return to Earth scheduled Wednesday.
EADS title sanctioned on the stock market
EADS stock is down sharply on the Paris stock exchange, after the aerospace and defense group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to revise its operating income forecast for 2007 due to delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditions the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros including more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating income (EBIT) targets for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without further details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS' operating income fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges related to delays in another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense, Sunday, at the exit of the ballot box: the Russians will massively opt for the party of President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, or even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days before the general elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sent voters a televised message on public channels, already recorded but the content of which is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory promises to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let it show by receiving foreign ambassadors, content to deliver a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, transparent and open elections,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the point.
She denounces a campaign marred by pressure.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said there had "never been such a dirty election, even in Yeltsin's time".
After the crackdown on last weekend’s protests, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
“The Russians have kept the homo sovieticus mentality”
Behind these unsuspended legislatives are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
There is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
Either way, in both the legislative and the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the homo sovieticus mentality, they don’t feel they are in control of their destiny,” says the sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Koposov, of St. Petersburg State University, goes further back: civil society has fallen behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin returned to the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease,” says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians “willfully renounce personal responsibility” which they had briefly demonstrated after the break-up of the USSR.
“What’s the point of thinking?”
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of United Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
People prefer stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Tamara Cherednichenko, a 54-year-old teacher, concluded: “What’s the point of thinking?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely accessible.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were up to now only available for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his successors.
The eleven states in charge of their management – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
As the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians’ access to Bad Arolsen will allow them to carry out research “in particular on the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced workers,” says Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, were opposed to the opening to the public of these nominative documents, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the supposed homosexuality or the mental disability of some of the victims of the deportation.
The registers of the concentration camps or arrest warrants drawn up by the Gestapo had been collected after the war with a practical aim: to find the civilians deported or subjected to compulsory work and, possibly, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Antisemitism at the Technische Universitet in Berlin in 2006.
EU and India to reach free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches almost 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
Last April, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU’s 9th largest trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
“A free trade pact will boost both economies enormously,” and “India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,” Mandelson said.
Europe is the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants trade annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services", said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that the bilateral trade of the EU has "not yet reached its potential".

Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion pounds over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday it was anxious to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
“To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period starting on December 6 in the form of a five-week open market operation,” the bank said in a statement.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
It seems to be the first time that the BoE has put five-week liquidity on the market in an open market operation.
These are normally done within a week.
The BoE added in its statement that it "stands ready to take further steps to maintain overnight" interbank lending rates in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate stood at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England had been accompanied by a significant penalty rate which had deterred the banks from using it.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the price of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums put on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to consider PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Enrolled in a socialist "niche" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted Tuesday by the national office of the PS among which the increase of 50% of the premium for employment, the reinstatement of the floating TIPP, a check-transport or the supervision of rents.
UMP and NC having voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was adjourned at the end of the general discussion which gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between majority and opposition a few hours before the televised intervention of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
PS MP Jean-Marc Ayrault has announced that his group will represent all of his proposals in the form of amendments to the amended finance bill being considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumours about C3 Presents' creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with someone who has inspired the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is scheduled to take place August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which annually attracts some 80,000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006 Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury “the most inspiring event” he’s ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We chose Philadelphia as our market and were working diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” Jones said.
“We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we got bogged down in politics because of the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to chat with Melvin Benn and we are about to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Chicago’s Grant Park, after standing out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8 million and $11.3 million, respectively, in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours take place in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give the impression of both a European-style country festival and an American-style urban festival.”
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports this event,” Jones said.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "they are interesting enough to allow to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is “very large”, like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been issued to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of going to press.
“Vineland will be rock-flavored, but the music will be varied, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces off against the Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood movie sets to Montreal when none other than Terminator opposes it.
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate – “politically difficult” because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces “runaway productions.”
Is it difficult to play in the legs of the "Governator"?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, she will go.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best,” he says.
The Race to Festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of local cinema.
The race for the Oscars has begun.
It will be a question of all the festivals on the West Coast, whether it is Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present Quebec films, highlight them and ensure that the directors do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a great showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil premieres in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
With less than five weeks to go until the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands hoping for the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year experts are not as sure that this will happen.
Banif believes that “statistically, the month of December on the stock market generally has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts exclusively based on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties are lurking in the markets, at least in the short term.
Although they are not in favour of the stock market gaining momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is nourished by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the leakage effect towards quality values both in the long periods and in the short ones".
For this, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not free of volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely decline in Fed rates, given the high level of crude and the danger of the stimulation of inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, BPI’s sales manager in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
“It’s not the best thing,” the expert said.
Ibex, the Spanish stock index, has lost nearly 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Intermoney analyst Juan Solana believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganisation of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the feast of the Constitution (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to the technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be provoked according to the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum costs.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that “this year great values are back for him.”
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco assures that the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
Builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they start.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” he said.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do it very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the past seven years, only on two occasions has December been a bearish month.
The authentic year-end rally took place in 2003, an exercise in which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the pierce of the tech bubble.
This year, during which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of the gains (for the moment Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it manages to computer on its rally at the end of the year.
Banque Populaire will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The Banque Populaire has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total 200 are the banks located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Populaire Max brand, represent a great change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that has decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20:30, and to open on Saturday from 10am to 20:30.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even if it has not yet decided to take the first step.
He is about to make a deal with the unions to close 75% of his offices on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the Banque Populaire experiment will be decisive for other organizations to join or not to join this initiative, which coincides with business hours.
This is precisely what the Banque Populaire is looking for.
Attract autonomous customers who circulate in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and street shops chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 branches located throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not the opening of new branches but a renovation of those already existing.
To do this, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The chief commercial bank, Angel Rivera, assures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but the hiring of staff, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Via streets in Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and apparently with success, according to Rivero.
Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others that operate under the Mundocredit brand, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very long schedules, which open even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where many of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero notes.
For the time being, they have reached an agreement with Telefonica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles its rival Antena 3’s stock market value for the first time
We got there.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a delegated adviser of Telecinco, expressed yesterday his satisfaction, at the close of the stock market, when he found that the channel he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect tarnished his joy: “What hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have decreased less,” he said.
However, he emphasized that in a weak market, ‘we’ve fallen less’.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain stabilizes its loss at 15.66% for a year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (an increase of 13%) reached 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which lost 1.52% yesterday and has accumulated a decline of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other comunication companies listed on the stock exchange is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Das) and 1,779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is due to the fact that ' we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel this year to surpass 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the managing advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaia, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
In order for this announced data to be real, the television channel would have to record for the current fiscal year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing compared to 965.4 million in fiscal 2006.
For its part, Net Billing for Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to $734.4 million) while Net Television Revenue increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that the analysts point to for Telecinco's best relative evolution on the stock market is the important pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarria distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
“We have the official compromise to give a minimal 50%, although we have always said a lot more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given shares with the 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its earnings estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in expected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the forecast for Antenne 3 earnings to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities recommends buying both stocks based mainly on its high dividend profitability and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid sees Telecinco better (accumulate) than Antenne 3 (maintain) for 'multiple attractions' and rising business.
3.
JPMorgan: he recommends looking at both cases since it has had ‘similar threats’ (a saturated market and a bad economic climate).
Congress approves transposition of Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel to its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress of amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the year ends.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the effort made by members and senators to negotiate and provide the best possible regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the organizations in order to make the markets work effectively.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Law, involves the modernization of financial markets, at a time when it strengthens investor protection, enhances the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial advisory services to be provided to both specialized corporate entities and individuals or legal entities, and creates a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of trades in financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment services firms to disclose on the market information on key aspects of its business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate control by the CNMV.
Passing through the Congressional Committee on Economics, several changes have been added, including one that highlights that the titularized debts will be considered a “complex” financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the debt of U.S. high-risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the management took the opportunity to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after in 1977, was approved, the royal decree that delimits the professional functions reserved to economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to lend its services of marketing products and attracting new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised consumer price index rises by five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by offering data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The leading indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not yet available at the time of publication.
INE recalled that the information provided by the leading indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data that will be revealed on 14 December next.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said that the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a “time figure”, but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on “relatively high” levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes clarified in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential about monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November “there was less surprise” than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a large increase.
"We were hoping for a figure around 4%," the minister of the Economy acknowledged in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros over three years
Northern Rock’s deposits have dropped more than 50 percent to 12,000 million pounds since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergence loan from the Bank of England.
At that time he was amassing some record deposits above 25,000 million pounds, a figure that is gradually dropped in two and a half months because of the distrust of his customers and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government has offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the organization with its financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the revenues of British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get this remaining 18,000 million pounds until reaching the goal of 30,000 million.
The tycoon group Richard Branson, known for its raucous advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named Virgin's association's offer, which includes three other companies, including his favorite to save him from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) today in the early morning because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption discovered this week.
Ade plus, one of the city council secretaries and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martinez Andreo has replaced last May's me Juan Morales, current right-wing deputy, and until then municipal councilor of the town hall, and which according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the Chain SER, could be the 'leader' of this frame.
The agents continue to search the municipal premises and those of the council of Urbanism and the possibility of new stops is not ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption network, discovered earlier this week, has been imputed.
As indicated yesterday by the SER Channel to the lawyer of the deputy of the "people's party" Juan Morales, he was arrested when leaving the home of Morales with important documentation in his possession relating to the frame.
Moreover, according to the sources of the investigation, the object of the investigation is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company of Galicia to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people detained.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party's bid for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win the election
Former Minister of Defense José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodroguez Zapatero, to be at the head of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
The secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced this during a press conference after the meeting that took place this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
Moreover, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Maron as president of the Congress, which on November 15 made public his decision not to run in the next general election and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the academic setting.
The former minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned it two years ago.
Moreover, he pointed out that, even if citizens already know who will be the economic vice president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to turn the House into “a house of respect and not of insult or screaming” and make “it look more and more like citizens.”
“Sometimes it seems lamentably that the only local in Madrid where you can’t talk quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times.”
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Maron and "his know-how" and he did not want to act as if he was already occupying his post so as not to fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents could consider "a domination".
Climate Propaganda
As the movement against climate change subjects skeptics of its predictions as well as those who give priority to other political and social battles to unmerited persecution, it must demonstrate ironic consistency.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is President of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a “new contract for the planet”.
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has contributed in a decisive way to Spain being at the head of the European Union in the non-execution of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who was responsible for the non-performance, in what areas it occurred and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
In addition, he must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be forced on us, what economic consequences will this cause.
That is, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was and will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the actual measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to corporate and individual accounts.
Up to a hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him to be so literally dangerous in Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is a question of saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with slogans devoid of any real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this man so useful for election campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not demand, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that it is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party and that does not claim that we move by bicycle or we refresh ourselves with the fan.
Mayor and Totana Local Police Chief Arrested for Alleged Urban Corruption
The Spanish Gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martinez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Hall and a hotel contractor suspected of possible urban offenses, have today informed the sources of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the town hall, where at the moment many agents met, who also presented themselves to the function of municipal councillor of Urbanism and to the municipal enterprise of management of the Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three stops are in addition to the six stops made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural soil to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but they are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Tribunal No. 1 of Totana investigates.
The first six detainees have now been transferred to court.
According to the sources, Totana’s previous municipal councillor and currently a PP MP, Juan Morales, is under investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was imputed, as was the current fiancée of the former city councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and the entrepreneur of Vigo (Galicia) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, Nuaria Group agency, and through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is the responsibility of the Group of Urban Crimes of the Central Operative Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a very well-known poultry products business in the area, who may have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that have been requalified and its project would involve doubling the population of the commune, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate development; Conycase, which manages the car parks of Vigo in the streets Corua, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Catalico; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's commentary in Finland's most important newspaper (admittedly leading PISA news above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day he appeared there, oddly enough, criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Philosophy course challenged public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the dead, a bachelor's student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and he asserted that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools.

A colleague passes on the information on the introduction in the Penal Code of crimes on downloads on the Internet:
A. Downloading a song would be a misdemeanor punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros, is considered only a fault (article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for a value of up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than that imposed for the download (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the traffic of CDs would involve a sentence of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected films without author's permission is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is right then someone is exaggerating.

My attending physician told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled: ‘Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less’.
That is to say, the feelings that the monthly pay of workers generates depends on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted using tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group in charge of neurocognition images at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed.”
The researchers observed that when both people guessed that they were receiving the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received double, the activation was greater.
I don’t know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly prosecuting Balkan war criminals for eight years from the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former leader Serbobosnio Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in this list of which the documentary of the Swiss director Marcel Schoepbach takes its title, 'the list of Carla' (2006, not screened exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a crime thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor of Belgrade in New York who pursues the criminals on the run and pressure on the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible claims, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, the age of the driver's license, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
They are that, escoger el seguro de autom vil adecuado es incluso mes diff cil que elegir el modelo de veh culo.
And that is, choosing the right car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the driving licence, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the rating to be paid.
It is for this reason that people over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower claim rate due to their prudence.
Similarly, using censuses, the companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the probability of having an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will explain the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various disadvantages when entering into a contract with insurance at an affordable price, as may be the low driving experience and seniority of the driver’s license.
Although the ideal way to be well insured is an insurance at all risks, other more economical options exist.
The most prospective drivers can opt for all-risk insurance with deductible, so that they get the coverage of an insurance at all risk but at a more accessible price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays a part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount will be," said Luis Noguera, Spain manager of First Europa, an online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
One piece of advice.
If you are under the age of 25, try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, since this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
“The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the company’s profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses," clarifies Noguera.
Beyond the age of 25 it becomes easier for drivers to enter into a contract with insurance, since the claim rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is best to choose all-risk insurance with deductible.
“Normally young people cannot benefit from the experience they have acquired after an accident,” says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once past the ‘fear of the novice’.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable that he negotiate insurance at any risk, as long as his economic situation allows it.
Child marriages are considered by insurers to be the people with the lowest claim rate, because the surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an all-risk insurance with deductible (may be 300 euros), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
“They have a more relaxed drive and they have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchises,” Noguera said.
For retirees, a risk insurance with deductible is preferable (being this one of 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us best according to our personal situation.
Celtic will look to win a point in Milan to reach the round of 16
AC Milan and Celtic Glasgow compete next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to rank.
The Italians have 10 points and have already qualified on the fifth day thanks to a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow have nine points, but they still need another point to ensure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass him in front.
These two Group D games will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as AC Milan is scheduled to play in the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place in the final on December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most anticipated result, although both teams will try to come out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning he would remain first and ensure a better cross in the round of 16.
A defeat by Gordon Strachan’s team might be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn’t win, but it won’t be able to count on just that since with nine points the game goes to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who are hopeful of ranking for the round of 16 for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extra time (1-0).
Pending the victory of the Rossoneri, the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, in case Celtic loses, to place for the round of 16 in order to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without opportunities to continue the European competition, could reach the third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend Spice Girls’ first concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour since the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their gig at Vancouver's GM Place Stadium that the band's reunion is "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people have sold out tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which is told the story of the band that was all the rage in the late 1990s.
The meeting and world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI releases in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls went on stage showing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' had given them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience that filled GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days before.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer “did not see our costumes so I’m nervous because I don’t know what he will think of the show.”
'Sporty Spice' who left the band in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and which caused the group to break up two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of people changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I’m glad I made a decision,” Chisholm said of the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, “things have settled down and we appreciate each other very much.”
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girl last showed in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of baby sitters was waiting for them.
She has five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will be on display on December 23.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine is raising the alarm.
A dispute over gas prices is brewing between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk of spillovers to fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are routed through pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two caused a decrease in supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia’s gas-providing monopoly company, tried in vain to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would raise its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50 percent more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would entail for Ukraine a 40 percent increase in import costs from Gazprom.
“It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, reminding that we are a country through which most of the gas passes,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters news agency.
“The fluctuation in gas costs would likely be related to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.”
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006 the interruption of supplies of Gazprom destined for Ukraine.
This led to the fall of exports to Western Europe, thus increasing prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The health ministry “must control its foreign employees.”
The Scottish Health Ministry needs to improve checks on its extra-community employees to check if they have any criminal precedents, the control committee said.
The warning from the Rev. General, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health does not have any specific data on the number of overseas workers it employs.
His report did, however, highlight other decisive checks, properly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General checked extra-Community staff following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, a doctor of Iraqi origin in the service of the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after driving into the gates of the main terminal with his jeep.
He was among three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October on suspicion of being involved in various attempts to blow up cars in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be certain of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the UK.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out checks on previous criminal offences, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside the UK.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office of Review of Previous Criminals, thus allowing employers to undertake checks on various countries.
"While we have found that some personnel information has been verified, this is not done every time," the report said.
Mr Black said the Scottish Health Ministry is carrying out most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he also added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on some overseas staff is available to health services.
Peter Terry, chairman of BMA Scotland, said it was “extremely unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify employees who might commit future terrorist acts.
“The report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently being carried out are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring any added value.”
Scottish health authorities said they employ 1,161 overseas workers, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
But the reviser general stressed that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, in part because of problems regarding the identification of staff members with open-ended contracts, who may or may not choose to stay in our country.
The investigation showed that the current control procedures of the health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and system of pre-employment checks for overseas health service personnel.
Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.”
She added that the Scottish Government, allied to the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings in the report due next month, and would commit to ensuring better execution of the recently updated pre-employment checks, which were valid for all employees, including overseasers.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the biopic about Joy Division’s latest singer, Ian Curts, won 5 awards, including Best Picture, at the British Indie Film Oscars.

The black-and-white film, whose soundtrack was directed by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot on a budget of just 3 million Sterling.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2’s Joshua Tree album, won two awards, the first as best director and the second as best beginner director.
The Rock was also awarded with the Best Documentary Award given to Julien Temple's film about the singer of the Clash, Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his portrayal of the driver of a Russian mafia boss, in the London-based thriller film directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, known for his tough character interpretations, won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old director, who has made films like Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award named in honor of the star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have given people like me access to the cinema,” he said.
“I’ve been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.”
“I was admiring this great actor today, I was extremely honored.”
The independent film Oscars, better known as “the Bifas” are awarded by a jury composed of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and bosses include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Blocks 208 Terrifying Conspiracy
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells plotting an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clerics and armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said that one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have staged a campaign against the U.S.-allied monarchy since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly assembled a group of 35,000 military personnel to protect the sites, following a failed 2006 Al Qaeda attack on the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper quoted a statement from the interior minister as saying that 18 of those arrested belong to a cell headed by a “missile launch expert” who has infiltrated the country.
Activists are said to be planning the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 appear to have plotted the assassination of clerics and armed forces.
The government has urged clerics to do more against Saudi-led Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting against the Allied Forces and against the US-allied Shiite Muslim government, considered heretical according to the hard line of the Sunny Saudis.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clerics have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by calls made against the pro-Western Saudi government by Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five... months,” the interior minister’s spokesman said on state television.
Among the detainees, there are 16 members of the Medina organized into a “media cell” aimed at promoting “Takfiri thought”, the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 people are accused of having subsidized the militants.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists yesterday said that Venus has certainly been a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit showed that the planet is certainly twice as small as Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus might have had Earth-like conditions, and might even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with slower rotation has led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is without water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface warm enough to melt lead.
The findings of Venus Express, the European Space Agency’s probe, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of Earth’s potential future due to catastrophic climate changes.
University of Oxford physics professor Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We are beginning to understand why Venus’ climate is so different from Earth’s, although the planets themselves are virtually similar.
“Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface.”
Enriched uranium sequestered by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was sequestered by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer said three people were arrested and the equipment is being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it is indeed uranium, but revealed that the commodity would be worth $1 million.
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he did not rise to the occasion as a presidential candidate, to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who registered their questions, submitted them to the candidates.
On Wednesday night, November 28, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as the one from another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers largely reflected the conditions of the Republican Party, candidate in the next election.
We don’t know on what criteria, the producers of CNN, who sponsored the debate, chose the clips of You Tube to show the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest on a single topic, focused on immigration.
This is one of the strongest topics for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they would hear pleasant things: The board noted increases in approval when candidates were speaking rudely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney who is leading the important early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants in his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when asked if they would be willing to promote "amnesia" (offering illegals a regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have managed to dig deeper into this subject.
Neither of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps thanks to the fact that they have begun to fight immigration before and in a more incisive way than the others.
Generally speaking, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, hold the same views: stiffer borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, combined with concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys made in China, or many other fears towards the external world, favors Republicans to forget, or to minimize the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the gun control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in the content of the Bible in its entirety.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even if he is not sure to believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
It was not expected that Mike Huckabee, who was in pole position in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism, would declare the death penalty painful though necessary.
When they insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus is too smart to run for office.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Huckabee’s rise in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious grant research by libertarian Ron Paul, and hissing during Wednesday’s debate.
These two have emerged from nothing, thanks to the fact that the two party protégés are unable to agree on who is the best known and most traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly through a message of success on American greatness thus bringing leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of Labour
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to sink; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra conjugal finger sucked.
But now a revelation attests that a wealthy businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than $ 650,000 ($ 1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have done well without.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister backtracked on his election plan, stupidly insulting British intelligence by proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped instead to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democrat leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The buyout of Northern Rock, a troubled bank on the brink of crack, demonstrated a breach of direction and poor judgment in an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have provoked a coalition of industry groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative blunder.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: they proclaimed that being defense minister is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of shady donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the general secretary of Labor (and his ex-head of vigilance) have caused them to have to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading out.
However, governments can come to a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don’t like politicians, and don’t trust them, but usually leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a Prime Minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he risks suspension: the public administration is no longer functioning; the cabinets of ministers are taking stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and without any goals.
In one sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he can't brag about being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he’s not directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes, such as the long investigation into party funds “cash for members of the House of Lords,” voters might think otherwise.
But Mr. Brown's difficult situation is not as tragic as it sounds.
The blunders are not so monstrous as the members of the Tory party make it seem.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to concretize Mr. Brown’s long-standing Stalinist tendencies, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal over political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very peculiar figure, who compares his donations to charity, said he does not want any public recognition of his beneficence.
He may have his opinion, but it is not for him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of big political backers are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has a right to know who is contributing to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, without knowing that it was illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as will Jon Mendlesohn, the head of grant collections who spoke about the dubious donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: There is no indication that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative loophole, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on something he knows well, using a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as find a permanent chair for the independent committee of the Standards of Public Life, without a leader for six months, and prepare a good reform on the financial of the political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to abandon its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservative party now has a good advantage in the election; it has two years to win back voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see fins fanned, swirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if contagion spreads from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in the rates of fees and insolvency, which measures the parts of the balance sheet that are not recoverable or that are, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken $1.4 billion in consumer credit, in part due to weak cardholders.
It is too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the third-quarter insolvency rate of 3.89% is almost a point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A 2005 U.S. change in personal bankruptcy laws caused a sharp drop in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy credit card losses; the number of records (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers must pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the volume of issuance for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct infection links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their debt now that fair mortgages have disappeared.
But card issuers are paying more attention to cash flow rather than the value of wealth, and so falling property prices have not necessarily led to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to credit card issuers.
Premiums to consumers for paying mortgages fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; therefore, credit card debt would become a priority to repay the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of a quick recovery.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and revalue all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, the director of Capital One.
If a financial catastrophe in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market bring America into recession, the industry will certainly face a macabre future.
Pay close attention to the dorsal fins.
The British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were to testify their roles in relation to a fraud committed by Enron's previous chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially declared themselves innocent of the seven charges of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam in order to enrich themselves in spite of their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all found themselves guilty of committing fraud.
The three ex-executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland PLC group, have become famous all over Britain because of the extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains an open question for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation into the Enron debacle.
The accusations against the bankers, dubbed the "Natwest Three" claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his ex-right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him rig bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest in the subsidiary to be zero, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the subsidiary's bank for 1 million euros.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 as interest for this company.
According to the charge, Fastow falsely told Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth this $20 million went into the pockets of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have gotten $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three Britons were released on bail of $1 million each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, previously the seventh largest national company, bankrupted in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even offer its bogus speculations as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of layoffs, more than $60 billion in lost market value and more than $2 billion in loss for retirement plans.
Enron’s founder Kenneth Lay and ex-CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the company’s collapse.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other offenses were unsuccessful because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
Not money, not out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“Even if no one really needs that many seats since it’s more of a family-owned aircraft or for the president of a company.”
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand last Friday, at the Millionaires’ Fair, a four-day consumer incentive orgy, which is held in a huge exhibition center around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to cars filled with diamonds like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was scrutinizing a bright orange Porsche, displayed next to his stand.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing like our product,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market.”
“Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas.”
“We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior Davis Department scholar of Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the world’s biggest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, at another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to Forbes’ list of the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are worth $670 billion globally, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank said that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative for London-based jeweler Davis Morris.
She participated in the show for the first time with the Russian distributor, Le Groupe Bijoutier de Soho.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking around the living room on Sunday night, the two real estate agents bet on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 claim to be like their clients, millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Ms. Yumatova, who grabbed her haute couture dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems to be aimed primarily at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue in the corks to come to a huge warehouse where are exposed Cadillac Escalades, platinum canives, ice creams, personalized pool tables, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears Gund.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” said Mr. Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal factory stand of Delf Dutch porcelain manufacturing, in front of a wall painting of Raimbrant on blue tiles, handmade.
“It’s clear that Russians are more interested in bling bling.”
Indeed, the sellers said here that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years are too by Russian standards) have already switched from bright logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not sell at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, either millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, walk the exhibition every day.
Some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and cotton mattresses inlaid with gold threads.
On the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said he sold a Russian millionaire, the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three wristband-like cars, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be inlaid with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires,” Karapetian said.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles.”
Even though many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Karapetian said the phrase “Russian millionaire” is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There’s more than you could think.”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company has erected four booths representing British phone booths, filled with mass counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s chief marketing officer, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passersby arrested for throwing masses of banknotes, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or pocketing a few million.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karyev said.
Unlicensed Surgeon Suspected of Homicide in New Jersey
It was Thanksgiving Eve when Ronald Livingston looked out of the window of the Just a little Healthier restaurant and observed an ambulance that had just stopped at the doors of the white Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,” Mr. Livingston, a restaurant official, said Wednesday.
That's when I realized someone had died.
Authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, who police have yet to identify, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are waiting confidently for the results of toxicological tests that, alas, will take time, but which should resolve this mysterious death that has saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been the assistant to the chief of police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” McCarthy said of Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
“She was like a pit bull.”
“She would have done anything to protect me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverages Control Board, and that she left two sons aged 14 and 11, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesman for the Union County prosecutor's office, Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives were trying to determine whether Ms Arroyo died from unauthorized surgery.
“This is a possibility to consider.”
“The investigation continues.”
Authorities said they arrived at her home around 3 p.m.
and found Miss arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and authorities haven’t said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if part of the house was being used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door of Miss Castro's house where a faded rose tree lies in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked in the back.
A blue canister called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a shed, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two off-road bikes hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since arriving in Newark 25 years ago at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this,’” he said.
“She was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
“It was embarrassing.”
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower rates related to the effervescence of the world stock market.
Shares were blown up on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would try to calm credit conditions, later reducing interest rates promoted by the soothing statements of the vice president of the US central bank.
Stock markets are exploding in London, New York and all over Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide, must be “flexible and pragmatic” in their actions in the turbulent financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure irritable markets in light of these new credit-related tensions, Kohn said the recent turmoil has partly “reversed some improvements in market functioning in late September and October.
Should this severe turbulence persist, it would increase the likelihood of further rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into U.S. markets, and that further cuts in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street down with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest drop in home sales for the month of October.
The repercussions of this financial turmoil have been accentuated following the statement of Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will fire 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to the losing bets of the real estate loans.
Only 20 jobs are planned in London, where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Dow’s industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55% to 13,289.40 while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points or 2.7% concluding at 6306.2 adding more than 39 euros to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index rose 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the resurgence of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted following the strong demand for an auction of monthly sorting funds issued by the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to track the Fed and the ECB and inject further funds into London’s financial markets causing credit tensions, has meant that the UK banks’ monthly “Libor” sorted borrowing rates have caused their highest growth since last September, at 6.59% following a sharp rise since 12 November.
England faces a call for judgment over criticism from Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We face two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the No. 6 drummer for England at Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second issue is important because David Graveney, the president of the coaches who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, captain, make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the president and CEO of England, is starting to fill out the application forms to become a national coach, at least on a part-time basis.
Whoever fails to win the No. 6 bib will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It is never easy to annihilate what allows one man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than for lack of ability.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is it a good time for Bopara to emerge?
Is that right about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, who to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"; both, new executives with good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is room for only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless they are given at least one chance?
Numbers are important in decisions, but also in opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricketer for a day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in top form and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors over 33 laps to earn a place.
Chris Tremlett has only taken 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to deliver again.
If it is Shah or Bopara who will play in the Asgiriya stadium, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man’s career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and did well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricketer of the Test, and this, despite the fact that his double cent scored against Australia in Australia can still be underestimated.
Probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experiment against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable debut in the innings of the Test of 88 in Bombay, 32 cents of first class against six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah did only ten laps during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, his city of Middlesex player, and that, the immediate rejection by the coaches when Vaughan again in shape, claimed his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his impulses so obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joie de vivre.
Nothing frightens him on a cricket pitch and he exaggerated when he recently crashed into a 4x4 at a presentation by England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He reported only minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at him from afar, to ask him if "'he saw this?'
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his shooting pace allows him to do services that suit him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Could this be the true art of selection?
I’d be good to give Bopara a chance, which doesn’t mean Shah shouldn’t apply if, as tea leaves suggest, he’ll be the one playing this weekend.
Buses bring people back to work, and to fight al-Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dumping these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope the city has regained normalcy.
Some came back to fight against the militants who took them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now.”
“They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!” he said, referring to the Shia militia of ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who has forced his men to move away for the time being.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime is preventing Iraqis from working.
Shia's neighbors in Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S.-assisted militia had helped drive Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited him back.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
But he had to come home to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys.”
“That’s why I’m coming home today,” said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many say they have been drawn to the growing lull in the capital since US troops arrived, and to the sight of ongoing training of well-armed “groups of involved citizens” working with the US military to defend their neighborhood.
But still others say they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, expressed the suspicion felt by all about the exile visas that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, who reportedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people have reportedly fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
“We didn’t have a problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” Sunni said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left.”
The decrease in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
There are fears that a sudden flow of refugees will once again increase sectarian tensions and bring the fighting back.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federated state leads in vocational training, and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-deprecating, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saar training system, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, the higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrucken in 1948 by the French.
Until now, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high quota of 15.6 percent of international students.
The Saar also takes the country's children to higher-than-average schools - many without a Gymnasium degree.
"In Saarland, we take advantage of the vocational training system," says Axel Plinnecke, an expert in training at IW.
More than one in five young people obtains their degree in a vocational school, so the Saar is more than seven points above the national average.
Also the possibilities of combining professional and academic training are relatively well developed.
Given the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education of Sarrois has forced the higher schools to a marketing campaign in engineering science subjects.
“After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools,” a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education said.
Thus, the government has introduced comparison tests throughout the state.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of kindergarten is exempt from law – a pattern that other federated states are copying as well.
Only future comparison studies will be able to show whether student performance is improving in a sustainable way.
In PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of at-risk students decreased from 29 percent to 20 percent.
In total, however, Saarland has not improved as much as other federated states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And to the great displeasure of the Sarrois, foreign language knowledge is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise one could earn points in this field.
Because the language of the neighbor is mandatory in high schools - even if the Sarrois are not French.
Chavez rules the watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will raise the clock by half an hour in the South American country.
Chavez has become a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated, because of a new law, the watches will be set at less than four and a half hours of universal time.
This way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
The anti-American Chavez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones into full hours.
In addition, Chavez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not have relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
“I can’t do it, only because of my dignity,” said Chavez, who is hastening a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chavez's mandate for negotiations on the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe reportedly “spit in the face” of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Sunday Chavez.
In Spain, too, Chavez is in every mouth.
A new cell phone ringtone is all the rage in the country: "Por que no te callas" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded from the internet.
It was pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was annoyed by the constant arrests of left-wing populists and told him to keep quiet.
A fall in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, according to a prognosis, a real wage loss threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all kinds of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Buckler Foundation, employees should expect a real decrease on their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies in the weak wage growth, the increase in the Value Added Tax and the rise in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Business Research told Bild newspaper.
There may also be new charges for unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbruck told the Neue Osnabruck Zeitung newspaper that the planned 3.3 percent reduction in unemployment insurance for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, in the words of the SPD politician.
It was reported on Tuesday that the explosion in food and hydrocarbon prices had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent year-over-year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like Earth than previously thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and swirls of wind at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have been assuming that there are lightning bolts on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has today provided proof - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: lightning on Venus burst at a height of about 56 kilometers cloud cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of cyprine, lightning would have made life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the corner stone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If there was life, it must have been on a very old date in history," says Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should be hardly any living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be Earth’s infernal twin, but it’s still a twin,” Russel said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental issue of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in the Venusian search, since no probe was on the way to explore this planet since the nineties.
According to the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several "Nature" articles do not only highlight the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that there are more things in common with Earth on our neighboring planet than are supposed to be at first.
So the researchers found, in addition to the wind vortices already known at the north pole, a swirl of clouds at the south pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon recalls air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The evening or morning star planet revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly recalls Earth, scientists assume that the two planets were formed under similar conditions.
Of the two, water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth in the form of carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Koehler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Kohler, demands an end to the quarrel between the parties over the Dalai Lama's welcome to the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs because of the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Kohler cares about Germany's appearance and calls on the grand coalition to close the dispute over the Dalai Lama's welcome.
“We must not present the outside world with a divided nation on this issue,” Kohler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Kohler showed understanding for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s (CDU) welcome of the Dalai Lama in September.
“Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for the differences between cultures,” said Koehler.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the reproaches that she would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
“China knows that too,” said Kohler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his displeasure with the Dalai Lama's welcome and had been attacked for it outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier complained about the CDU’s “frontage policy” on foreign policy.
After the welcome of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese relations.
So the Chinese government not only ordered German Finance Minister Peer Steinbruck (SPD), but according to Spiegel information, also froze the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao now demands that German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge that the Dalai Lama’s welcome was a mistake.
China refuses to allow European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official duties, thus supporting Wen Jiabao's position.
The words and deeds of the Dalai Lama would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also encompasses other current provinces.
Schaeuble warned against riots like those in France.
Street fights with the police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns against riots like those in France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not break out in the streets with violence, the German Interior Minister demanded.
Burning barricades, crackers shooting at police with shotguns: after the serious youth riots in France, the German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not also form in our country and defuses into violence.
We must take this seriously," he told the Neue Presse in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated states and the communes were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schaeuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
“From integration summits to conferences on Islam, this is already showing its first successes.”
But it would be too early for an end to the alarm.
Schoeuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems nor from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Paris conurbations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned down.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German government are what the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imitative effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need for action.
Kolat stresses that the quota of unemployed young people under 25 years of age with an immigrant background would be above average.
Above all, more places should be provided for training.
Kolat insisted: “We must give young people a perspective.”
The President of the Turkish communities added, however, that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young people with an immigrant background also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat exhorted, “But we still have to be careful.”
Young people should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training.
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with searchlights.
Authorities have reported three arrests, as well as a few burning cars and garbage cans.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces ensures calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit of the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following night, the troubles overflowed in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The chancellor’s utopian entry shows that the coalition is done with the bottom – and there’s nothing left to expect from her.
In which country does this Chancellor live?
After his distressing intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should, in the end, be governed by it.
The reproach of focusing too much on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said, and only showed by that that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, she made it clear to everyone how accurate this criticism was.
There was no real interest or feeling for the country's problems.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a politician in weightlessness, who flees into foreign policy and even there remains in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it welcomes the Heiligendam agreements again and again, but does not say how the climate goals will have to be achieved in our country.
Even self-praise - having so little modesty, the leader of the CDU would have refused it again two years ago.
Now she clings to ready-made formulas, that growth would touch people.
It destroys her image as a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic politics problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few additional phrases for that.
This is indicative of the number of times she slips when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce a half-precise sentence.
It staggers in unknown territory, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, both favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney engage in a tough offensive battle – and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates already erupts on the first subject.
He would have made New York a "refuge for illegals", criticizes Mitt Romney to his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
“I would say his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants,” Giuliani replies, and blames the former Massachusetts governor for employing undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are on the rise: since the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debates on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that internet users have sent via Youtube are little more than blowers.
“It was with this kind of isolationism that we allowed Hitler to come to power,” McCain told his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also being vigorously lectured by Vietnam veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation that simulates drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture can be seen in the reactions of the common room in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whether conservative values are praised or future tax increases are denied, applause is pouring into the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favourites are revealed once again.
“I made a mistake at that time,” Romney said, and apologized to both the base and the television audience for still being an abortion supporter in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, goes into a noose when asked his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian clothes.
A day after his withdrawal as army chief, Pakistani man of power Musharraf was sworn in as president.
Eight years of military rule ended.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and bowed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power by a bloodless putsch, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By withdrawing from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf declared on November 3.
Already shortly after his inauguration Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another demand of the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the state of emergency was declared with lawyers from his ranks, last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on a street near the border with Afghanistan.
The Krautrock Fathers are back.
Germany's supergroups of the seventies are playing again: the three members of the band Harmonia have once again taken their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return appeared recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The anticipated sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has their little box in front of them, their cable and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
He is flanked to the left by 57-year-old Michael Rother, who owns a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes this inadvertently adds up to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia is playing again has ensured some excitement among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, certainly, the name reasons in the collective memory of pop, but in no way so durable that this group misses so painfully for 32 years.
But why should German not also have the right to celebrate its living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is misleadingly called "Krautrock" has always been more popular in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, we saw in the hall the German pop faces interrogators.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Dusseldorf and Neu! in eulogy, the astonishment had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped onto the Red Hot Chili Peppers stage as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration into the unknown is the one and only.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during this period, the impact power that felt was much weaker than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We played first in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Dusseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly troubleshooted in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which was at the time perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the forests of Weserbergland.
There, in an old Weser farm, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the Kommune I community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the manner of Spitzweg.
Supposedly was in the trash a pennant of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many hold Harmonia away from this.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next was "De Luxe".
Because as serene and modest as the music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest of dead wood alone was not used for self-seeking.
The newly released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as well as someone who believes to remember.
Rother expressed at that time the wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
This was an immoral demand for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and ensured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster revived in the eighties and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe Griessem's Live album to Herbert Gruenemeyer.
His label, Gruenland, has set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been unearthed on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmony takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly funded as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of Krautrock's influence would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's phrase hovers in the room amidst the singular sounds: "The only real music, you listen to the future."
There are pictures that show the producers with Harmonia in the room of the farm.
Projections of other black and white photos of bazaar-wired tools serve to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and the drums, to draw to the instruments unheard sounds thanks to the effects instruments built yourself.
Today, electronic music is like electronic music.
The three in great technical figurines.
Even the house choir won’t change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, one coughs and whispers under the cloud of sounds, and one sings at a nice moment "Aaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots have been less sought in the blues than in conservatories of music (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia also does not allow herself to be irritated by this anymore.
But what is most self-evident will be carefully covered on the stage.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
It can tap into someone's nerves (?) or grant fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With “The Hunting Party” and “The Deadly Peace”, two films are once again tackling the Balkan War.
But the two are not convincing.
Either the projects are based too much on action and insane exchanges of fire or on the contrary they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news is that the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is precisely there, in the darkest hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is found.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many nice and futile roles in sentimental films for women and too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch anyway "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why should today's movies be as long and confusing as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a magnificent performance full of winks: deep down, his character as war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has had his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a crumbling monument to his decline, has nevertheless kept visible remains of his old charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Peace killing", which also comes out this week, the endless series of failed films on the Balkan war.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serbian from the Kosovar snipers, in which one of the two still falls in love quickly.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not for once presented as the only causes of all evils, this film as flat as a TV movie is lost too quickly in the action and the exchanges of senseless shots.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why deep down there has never been a real good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who condition themselves to track down the top war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, along with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go in small teams into the forest, to accomplish something the military can’t do and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply do not let Simon Hunt be the cynical deserted with a heart, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute to him a romantic adventure with a Bosniak murdered afterwards.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, manages to what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters of the world have not succeeded in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him for a just revenge to the Bosnian Muslims.
It is so bad that the International Court of the Hague should be brought before it for a crime against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must agree exceptionally) not to conduct the hunt quite intensively because of secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the wicked are so similar this time that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
The one speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet’s work table: “Compassionate, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tired it is to be mean.”
Movies such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but that insinuate how tired it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there has never been a good film about South Africa.
What is worth every time: when a star hangs out on a crisis center or on a minefield, he then comes out with something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
In any case, decades have gone by before Hollywood could make a good movie about the Holocaust with Schindler’s List.
Some films have yet to mature - those that are now worth classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" were by no means celebrated unanimously in their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we also know today simply too much about the conflicts of the world, where each hecatomb arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And it delights the writers with the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
“Being or not being” or “The Dictator” have actually become as good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin didn’t yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don’t want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps it is necessary to have the sarcastic and distant artistic look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's only because some things never change."
“Big cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrifying manner, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust receives criticism for the cancellation of the Olympiad.
The mayor's retreat from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has met with virulent criticism in politics and the economy.
Many want to keep fighting for the Waterfront Games.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of chances.
The head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jorg Schmidt-Trenz, described the abandonment on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as much motivation in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
“Without this objective, the political and sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures.”
Schmidt-Trenz urges the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point in the longer term, "which takes as its starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed with his earlier statements on Wednesday that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
“It’s not Hamburg that decides on a bid for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation,” Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the Sports Federation’s expected decision in early December on Munich’s bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us, that in the time we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance.
However, the dream does not definitively belong to the past, said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust’s statements.
From this the impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to close an opportunity, by burying the projects already now,” HSB President G?nter Plo? said on Wednesday.
A withdrawal of the candidacy would be further in contradiction with the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust reportedly called Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiade "not a substitute" for the Olympics in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first in the past weeks appointed Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor’s SPD faction blamed the Senate for not using this precious time in building housing in Hamburg.
“The development of Petit Grasbrook was refused by the Senate for years because it played the card of the Olympiads and excluded the construction of housing,” said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded for Petit Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympiads and a later use of housing, the CDU would have bet exclusively on the "Event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg would have aroused great enthusiasm.
Hamburg had, however, broken up against Leipzig.
It's not Warhols' coffers.
The one who connects the concepts of Sweden and wooden case, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, Swedish-made wooden crates are casting shadows on Warhol’s list of works.
A large part of the ninety Brillo-Boxes of "Stockholm Type" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" doubted the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes a few months ago, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm today leads to a disillusioning result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", of which the former director of the museum Pontus Hulten gave a gift in 1995 to the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a large "Box"
Ancient history is entangled, a disconcerting web of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the soap cartons powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been directly delivered from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden crates in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden crates that at the time would have entered right into the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the name "Stockholm Type".
Some of them have reached over $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén museum later falsely claimed that about a hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would then have ceded to him.
In truth, the 105 cases of Hultén were produced in Malma in 1990 only, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Bystrom, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the museum’s six Brillo-Boxes, three other Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and sanded, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The texture of the copies that date from the year 1990 reveals on the contrary that the paint was directly applied without a bottom layer on the laminated panels, using a roll of paint - moreover it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These crates have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of the Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol," suggests the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six crates in its collection as copies/material."
Already in July the Authentication Board has of course announced that it will investigate the "heavy accusations" that will be raised in the case of the boxes of soap powder.
But since then, there has been an inexorable silence.
Rebel Soldiers in Manila Abandon
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers give up, the same ones who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
The soldiers loyal to the government had shortly before stormed the hotel with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been entrenched for hours in the building.
About half of them were standing in court Wednesday due to a failed coup attempt in 2003 – among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclipse himself with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who normally had to watch over them, had apparently deserted in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the removal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Troops loyal to the government closed the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People have had enough,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
Gen. Danilo Lim, who was in command before the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other army units soon wanted to join the march.
Critics of the regime had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The financial district of Manila was already since 2003 the scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
The uprising broke out nearly 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel.
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as communicated by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 percent of the share capital would be held.
We had previously speculated on a buyout.
The option would remain open to further increase the stake in Versatel.
With this step, we are seeking to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its stake in the network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institute would hold the money only for a third part, it is said in the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a stake of nearly 10 percent in mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch listed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile phone products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a United Internet spokesperson said.
The two companies founded the joint-stock company MSP in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
At the moment, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not make use of their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent at Freenet, United Internet said Thursday.
The two companies would, however, leave all options open, especially to increase the stake in the SA Freenet, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
The poker still difficult to predict on Freenet which lasts for months is part of the consolidation of the German market of telecoms.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile customers and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
United Internet Holding and Drillisch previously held a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01%.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring about four percent more.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
