What will happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new elected officials of CSSD at the mayor of the capital will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the level of the city council with their old and new colleagues of the ODS.
The daily Actualne.cz has "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, whether they know the argot that was born in recent years in the town hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition that were leading in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague’s political cream set in motion during Mayor Pavel Bem’s previous era describes some of the city’s personalities, situations, and causes.
It is with surprise that it was discovered that the new elected officials do not understand very well the known terms.
At least they say so.
"Who is Valdemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I am a youngster in the politics of Prague," responded Lukas Kaucky, the elected to the culture to the test of the vocabulary of the "godfather".
And as for the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example the meaning of "golf hole".
"That's the only expression you're suggesting I use."
Otherwise, I don't use the gunpowder.
Vocabulary, which the daily Aktualne.cz published in June of this year before the pre-election congress of the ODS, the editorial team chose 6 examples, primarily those related to the Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the patisserie", "beef nerve", "betrayal of the capital" and "entangle".
Three of the elected officials agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek flatly refused the test.
“I don’t care at all about these things and how the representatives of citizen democracy enjoy themselves: I won’t give my opinion.”
“I’m currently dealing with how we’re going to understand each other as part of our programs,” he said.
As has already been heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the above legend, that it is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the ex-mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
“It’s the Blanka tunnel,” Kaucky said, adding: “But I know that from the newspapers.”
“I’m going to have to pay for a language course,” he jokes.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the elected for the environment, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
Both social democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of the meaning of "going to the pastry shop".
“It’s, I think, about going to a company,” Plachy is ready to guess that this is the headquarters of Janousek’s companies.
In the same tone Brezina recalls that he derives his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests there is no lexicon of argotism in social democracy.
“I’ve taken advice with colleagues and it appears that we really don’t have something like that.”
"We call ourselves names sometimes we use abbreviations and symbols," says Peter Hlinsky, president of the Social Democratic Party, which party members call Hulda.
“I was called Briza at school but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” Brezina said of the nicknames.
The newspaper Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for the members of the Party or the least friendly Little old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by scams during the sponsoring of the party, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones that the Social Democrats admit to using inside the party.
It seems that Hulinsky doesn't like to hear Hulda, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in truncheon law" is said to recall that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title of Doctor in law JUDr. at the bratislava police academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches", has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
They are rather part of the old generation, cannot work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one that becomes "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man very rarely has this destiny."
“You also don’t judge young women in good health because they participate in work and give birth to children,” says a sister who works in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special facility of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He has published a brochure that should help limit the witch hunt.
The case has a "hic."
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” the daily Die Standard warned of the inconvenience of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, Burkina Faso’s neighbor Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they had sprayed on her.
The BBC server transmitted this information.
Criminals say it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointing was ignited upon contact with the woman.
The oil ignited, it seems, when the team wanted to “chaser the bad spirit” of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: “Human mind-eaters have always been a danger,” he says.
While Burkina Faso is working to reduce witch-hunting, Gambia saw the President himself participate as recently as last year.
“The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a large witch hunt which, it seems, would have participated in his death and would have striven by black magic to kill the President as well.”
“Shamans from nearby Guinea, who came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the President’s personal guard, randomly chosen men and women in villages in Gambia,” Amnesty International said in a message.
At the farm the imprisoned people had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that caused in addition to other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
On the international pressure about a thousand people were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The stoves are heating up, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man walked out the door of the RPG Byty company's customer center from the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He had under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, his daughter’s and his son’s who is serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 apartment of second category 4100 crowns.
“And there is no hot water and the heating is running on solid fuel,” points to his son’s new contract as the man with the signing power.
"But I signed anyway," he said, angry and half resigned.
The citizen association of the BytyOKD.cz apartments, which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But the man reacts to this with a gesture of the hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" while frowning.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not match the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesdays at 9am.
Right next to the door stands a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is turned on on the touch screen.
A single press and paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your "157" number as your number is already starting to light up on the big screen under the waiting room topit.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short while, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems like everywhere else - demands for repairs, insurance-related events and the like.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving mail with new leases in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
the special window for new rents has been open to the public since November 18.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still on trial," replies, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the customer presents himself as a journalist.
Deragulation and the old miners’ apartments of Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of the parliament and native of the Ostrava region Lubomir Zaoralek of the social democrats reported fairly strongly before the elections and it now fills the local newspapers.
“Twenty years after them, I want a new floor.”
"They didn't even change me a put...n of board in the toilet, relieves himself in introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to make sure they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they sign up now as promised RPG in a special offer.
This is a discount of half the amount of the rent that will be received by the other renters who have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" counter on Havirovaska street is really not overwhelmed by the questions.
“Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for the rent,” the employee said at the counter.
And yet RPG displays both on its website and in the windows of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on the rent, an independent tribunal will make the decision.
"It's not about threats, it's only about informing people about the unique and legitimate way to act legally," RPG said on its website.
“Nobody’s going to court here,” one of RPG Byty’s employees thinks, and the man on the street in front of the customer center agrees.
“I have 13,000 crowns of retirement and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don’t have enough to go to court,” he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore people wait," she said.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
“And, moreover, current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the fund for housing,” recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the fund for housing that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG could with rents invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this should make 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging on the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs of the waiting room on Havirosvka street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
The rent increase in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments.
"And it will always be at most 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," the screen says.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is a really low increase of 19.66 Czech kroner per m2," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (cf. the graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of savings in heating - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the rent increase have priority.
The kindergarten is also part of the offices that included the architects.
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini kindergarten with everything you need - colorful walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, children of Arch. design employees can go there.
The architectural project company Arch. Design, whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has designed its mini nursery school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, mostly of child-bearing age, and it was important for it that women architects and project managers could quickly return to work.
Along with reduced-time employment contracts, the nursery school is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine work that takes care of children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who imagined this nursery school and with the support of the management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-kindergarten is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme for Human Resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding (up to 2.8 million Czech crowns), they were able to buy equipment and appliances and after two years ensure a qualified staff as well as the start-up.
After the use of the funding endowment (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it was the company Economy rating that helped to apply for the grant.
Care for children is provided by qualified staff, all day a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of the children. the children can go to kindergarten without age limitation but they are more than three years oldfor the most part.
As this is a "mini kindergarten" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who replace themselves.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it involves individual care and education, the curriculum of the mini-kindergarten is comparable to that of pre-school education.
Children do not only play there, but quality teaching is also assured - from the beginning to the preparation for school benches we teach English.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and not have the stress of a delay to pick up the children in a school away from the parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty is created between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design. is thus one of the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look at Gaudi's interiors.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase looks like a dinosaur spine and the balconies look like open fish mouths.
This is how the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi is.
Due to its organic forms, the house has received from the locals the nickname of Bone House.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is ypic for the Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaudi.
The front facade of the house unfolds its dream lines, its colors and pleasant textures that remind nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see the geometry, the rhythm and the order thought with precision.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of color brilliance is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies in waves the window frames, the railings, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyelet and the slats.
The Battlo house, which stands in the Eixample district in the Passeig de Gracia shopping street at number 43, was born from the construction of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, initially insisted on demolishing the old construction and building another brand new one but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-unit house was not conceived by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that were born the decorations for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade.
For the facade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for the plans of Casa Battlo began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi Casa Mila's house and Park Guell in which there are other works by Gaudi.
The locals nicknamed the hot house just after it was finished because of its organic shapes "the Bone House".
Others, having regard to the specific mechanism of opening the windows called it "the house that bleated".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of St. George the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi has designed for the house a unique system in its time of central heating, with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree tilt looks odd.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not respect the construction guidelines of the time and did not let himself be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the building permit, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the finishing the city council was horrified and asked for modifications.
For example, it did not please the members of the municipal council that the pillars of the construction were encroaching on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the city's call Josep Battlo requested (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase that leads to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled out by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the salons and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction received besides new facades a non-traditional roof and two floors more.
Gaudi's play with light is also impressive, with blue and white glazed tiles with which is decorated the inner courtyard and with the skylights.
The two-color play gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that the white reflects more than the dark which on the contrary absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house which was inscribed in 2005 in the Unesco World Heritage Fund can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous designer.
They continued the visits as they found it to be a lucrative venture and they expanded the scope of visits to the common areas and attic including the roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the price of entry into Gaudi's other buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and completely visit the house.
How to choose a mattress and a box spring: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for bed, so the mattress and bed base give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are determining,: the weight, height, age, state of health as well as the gender of the owner.
The type of interior in which we will place the mattress and the box spring is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the country house where we do not sleep continuously latex mattresses are not appropriate because they "warm up" gently.
In addition, they weigh more than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mold can also form there.
Habit is also decisive in choice.
Those who spend time abroad, where very thick mattresses with a softening layer are frequently used, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
“That’s how all the hokeyists who come back from NHL complain that they can’t sleep there.”
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a foaming layer of laziness."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore mis-assume "information" of the joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hokeyists as well as other customers.
“Today everything works well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have for example appropriate mattresses.
You don’t have to be an NHL guy to be able to enjoy a lazy moss.
This “miracle” just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won’t turn around in the night like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against squaring.
To choose the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or in total 180 cm.
For single beds, singles for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 / 140 cm.
It is convenient in case of a visit.
"However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should lay your hands comfortably with your elbows slightly bent. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bodybuilders and Decorators who has been dedicated for several years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and teaches it in specialized schools.
For a bed with two places each needs its own box spring and mattress, so be careful however during the achât to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only have to mount the bed base at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, this count for the shape and ventilation layer at least three centimeters.
"When touching or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a specific type of bed base.
The bed-sleeper, when the mattress and bed base are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
Mattresses abate very badly; it should not be washed, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night one normally sweats from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and clogged) sieve.
For this, specialists refuse to advertise for a 25-year lifetime for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But everything to his but.
And for this an experience advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the coating of the mattress, hygiene or washing but rather add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to manufacture coatings with zipper for the whole, that is to say that after the opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the handling for large models (and for one person) becomes when they are removed a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a box spring?
Ever!
Maximum for a bed intended for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are none) with air holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with sachet springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of air.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-position slatted beds with 14/18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are doubled in the lower part of the kidneys and it is thus possible to regulate the rigidity.
For multi-position mattresses, you should not take a spring mattress because it does not respond to changes in position.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the slats, you can also install what is called a shoulder cradle.
It is a special connection of the slats that makes it possible to press or even tilt the slat so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have "shoulders as wide as their backs," that's really an important thing.
This thing is already being considered by mattress manufacturers who for the "masculine" have started to use a softening area at the shoulders.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or pad bases with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure spreads in more points and diinuates the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated with air) on good mattresses and box springs, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians by example prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level (with the shoulder cradle of the bed base or the area slammed into the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones based on straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also towards organic mattresses.
Petrol-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is made, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soy.
“The organic label for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products,” says Petr vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavender scents.
There are differences between man and woman.
While birch plant extract for the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
Red pepper extract speeds up blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weak sex.
The current favorites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cell structure so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, lower back and feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 kroner and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached first place.
Saving for the mattress and the box spring is not easy.
One may from time to time have in connection with special actions on the part of the manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of only one.
For example, Magniflex offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course, you can take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a great thickness was started with Tempur material at a "cosmic" pace.
This started as matter for NASA because astronauts were undergoing huge load factors at startup.
The Tempur softens in heat and hardens, on the contrary, in cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure.
It is therefore ideal for sleeping poorly and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special cushions for the feet that relieve the legs and the venous system.
For example, Czech manufacturers use EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly in demand by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can just as well be used to trace the movement of people and help in some cases such as for example that of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a matchbox but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved a large number of people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not espionage but only another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy,” said Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
“The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
According to him children should always know for what purpose is used "the box" and how to use it in case of emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bockova draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to carry such a thing, he will get rid of it.
“And even the little ones can show great creativity when it comes to purposely getting rid of something when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Mobile phones, which can cut off like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long waits,” Bockova says.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is very questionable.
"If it is a prepared abduction, the author will do everything so that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him."
“Currently, it’s the phone.”
"As soon as the tracking devices develop, they (criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
“In such cases the criminals will always be ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
She admits that such devices can help in an unprepared attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an assault.
"The device can be configured in such a way that it is in regular emission after a specified period of time."
“In the event that the device is destroyed, it still remains the last position of the person concerned.”
“The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and ends up in a lying position without moving,” Cech said.
According to him, so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special software package.
The problem with current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn as a matchbox-sized pendant or to smaller telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the Macro Weil company, this is why tests are currently being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the possible attacker will not be able to recognize the tracing device."
"Or he will realize it after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracing device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as for tracing cars.
It is a combination of position acquisition systems using GPS (which is commonly used in autonavigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating cords that it could go around the Czech Republic with it, but it can only last two years.
The army bought 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Last year, the Department of Defense purchased 224 km of it.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the ropes is from two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating cords from the public company STV Group for 40 million kroner.
The General Staff gave as a reason for the achât of a huge amount of detonating cords to MF DNES that the soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the calculations of reserve to be held made by the pyrotechnicians of the army, which MF DNES has contacted, it emerges that even the generals, the officers having a command, secretaries or the cleaning staff should have each year an exercise in explosives.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army's reserves could sustain it for 10 years.
If on the contrary it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is enough to more than 2 m of detonating cords, as the experts say, it means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, soldiers from the Rapid Intervention Brigade have recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
About the lack of body linen we don't talk about it.
"And I don't mind if they buy such a large amount of detonating cords from us."
“And that’s their decision and they really know what they’re doing.”
“For us the military is a good customer that we strive as traders to please,” says STV Group sales manager Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of miles of explosive cords will be hit by the fact that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reports only four years of life of the detonating cords and the pyrotechnicians of the police and army of only two years.
“If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can even go up to four years,” said one who does not want his name published given the criticism of the army.
The life span passed, each munition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating cords.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said spokesman Pejsek, who is interpreting the opinion of the buyers of the defense ministry.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating cords of police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their service life.
This was established for the safety of pyrotechnicians and to be able to obtain more flexible types of detonating cords more modern and more reliable.
Today the Ministry of Defence has big problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading on the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating cords that it buys today "cheap".
So far, I have benefited from the contacts I have gained through the contests.
The franchised sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the Best Individual Entrepreneur competition.
The winner of last year’s Best Individual Entrepreneur contest was 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukas Pytloun.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Libérec there was a lack of a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned when he worked abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in the third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of accommodation in our region made me want to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building which he transformed into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial action has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, another of the same quality came to him.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the Pytloun hotel franchise came forward,” the No. 1 contractor said.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the entrepreneur of the year contest served well," adds Pytloun with gratitude.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me in the streets, congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very pleasant,” he recalls.
He recommends participation in this contest to all those who strive to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says that he uses his contacts and knowledge until today that he could not have obtained in any other way.
"With those I met through the contest I started to maintain business relationships regularly.
According to him, the reputation linked to success also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
"I see in them above all the loyalty and pride of having committed to something that has generally been recognized."
"This is not, by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
“Only my name is pushed forward,” says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory has been quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the winner’s sense of purpose Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who picked up the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place in the contest for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged me my collaborators and increased our self-confidence to fight against the competition,” said the winner of last year’s competition.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet there was the desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky’s father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate for long, refused a career at a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in his father’s entourage for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not very long after they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, it has become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success obtained in the contest through the media.
“Not only did our customers start to really get to know the Farmet brand better but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were collaborating with a company that got the most success in its home country,” says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year has not happened at Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on economic results from 2008 and in part from 2009.
And precisely in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machinery.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect the citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their purchases of new materials and technologies.
“We obviously did not escape this situation.”
“The turnover fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off,” Zdarsky said.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation properly and maintained beneficial results even though they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, at Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
“We built with the endowments a training and research center, strengthened the presentation of the company in international trade fairs and won the main awards in national exhibitions,” says Zdarsky.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers go up and with them the number of employees as well.
“To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere,” says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes insane regulations.
The survey on the Absurdity of the Year is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be removed.
The inglorious winner of this year's survey on the Absurdity of the Year was the obligation to bring to the offices documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the administration of social affairs requested a paper extract from the commercial register while the official can obtain it in two mouse clicks.
It changes because of the investigation.
“The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer ask for an extract from the Commercial Register for insurance payment checks,” said Jana Buranova, spokesman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Bringing out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fulfill in the Czech Republic and having those that are absurd removed is the meaning of this year's absurdity contest.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3000 voters came forward, it is at least 4000 this year that have brought their vote.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most various legal obligations that only slow down the company, and, this, more and more.
“We may be the number of documents to fill out for tax returns to the top places in the world,” says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, 8 places higher than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first established in 2006 and continues each year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, the last deadline before the end of the competition.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the contest organizer chooses seven candidates for "anti-prize" and leaves the public to vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that received the highest number of votes is declared the winner.
Until the last survey last year, there were a hundred, or more precisely 105 regulations and decrees that lost their meaning of existence.
Comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the contest, therefore among the nominees is for example the obligation that maintenance vehicles of highways and expressways pay the tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the contest, which always begins in early November at Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening that regularly involves personalities from political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the high point of the competition.
“Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts stumbling blocks in the legs of entrepreneurs and for that my goal is to delete, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the business,” said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to suppress absurd decrees is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what did not please people was the obligation of the entrepreneurs to declare three days before to the office for the sole proprietorship in the place where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the amendment of the Individual Business Act.
The second most popular requirement in 2007, which was to report a 30-day foreign employee to the Labour Office, was removed with the text of the so-called Green Card Act.
And everything is ok until the third session of the contest.
The absurdity of the year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year – the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training or sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's competition of Hospodarske Noviny, which already exists for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the year 2010.
The premise of this contest is reasonable and fair business support.
“We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their company on the environment and conduct a socially responsible activity,” says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodaphone, which is the guarantor and promoter of this contest, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the competition of the firm of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodaphone, have registered the companies that do not succeed with a single long-term goal for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich of inspirations and an independent article would be to edit.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be seen as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns people with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the entire Czech Republic is the software company Et Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
The old paper factory in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of employees with health problems, was awarded the title of Responsible for the Central Bohemian Region and placed third in the region in Vodaphone's Firm of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, which has earned for having introduced flexible working hours and even decreased up to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionately, lower wages.
The jury also awarded her the title because she primarily buys from Czech manufacturers, supports a local activity and cares about the environment.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment,” said Miluse Ryznarova, the company’s executive director.
the company responsible for IT Enlogit of the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has set them for each laptop an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their work from home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
“We also support the Man in the Shadow Foundation, which helps the local Roma community,” said Ondrej Suchy, the company’s representative.
At the very last rank is, also for its activities, a company of Washing and cleaning of the region of Karlovy Vary, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increased skills and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the construction company Bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravian-Silesian region.
All the regional finalists for Vodaphone’s Firm of the Year competition were automatically registered in the Responsible Company category, who had completed the questionnaires attached to the registration document and sent it back to the organiser before August 15.
Improper or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were removed from the contest by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing firms had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the Responsible firm but were not disqualified from the "principal" competition the Vodaphone Firm of the Year".
"Independent registration is not possible because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the Firm of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public contest
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed the local entrepreneur and real estate trader Lubos. G.
The latter had tried to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a request for restitution in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a specific candidate.
He had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
“At the moment I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider trading in connection with a public tender and competition,” Plzen prosecutor Antonie Zelena told the Pravo newspaper, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
Police released the 46-year-old entrepreneur after 24 hours.
To know how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate in view of the so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, Lubomira Cerna Land Fund spokeswoman said that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a client and not an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has the real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land according to the Law on the Land" and is set up when several candidates beneficiaries of rights appear.
“These people are proposing, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to reside, which must be settled before the value of the land is announced.”
"According to the proposed rights, a classification of the purchasers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who has proposed the highest rights," explained the spokesman of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information concerning the persons who had registered for the appeal and since he himself was also a beneficiary because he had bought a large number of rights to restitution, he had proposed to the candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he was probably cashing in by the fact of withdrawing.
This would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above the standards at the FdT (Fonds des Terrains).
He was included in the case of the former head of the FfT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for editing land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been edited.
Precisely Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the access road to the industrial zone of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was obliged to accept because otherwise it risked jeopardizing the construction by blocking the land.
Households will pay an additional 100 crowns per month for housing.
Households will have to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
As of January, families will have to draw up to a hundred crowns from their wallets monthly more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be around 100 kroner annually for apartment households than at present.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices in view of the significant development in encouraging the manufacture of renewable energies, in particular photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
We can also count a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
These are mainly the largest municipalities that plan the price increase.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay almost 50 crowns more per month for central heating starting in January, families in Libérec will pay more than 1,000 crowns annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague is preparing an increase of 9 percent for water and sanitation in case the city increases the infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the pragois will pay an extra 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest compared to the entire country.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are up 7.4 percent.
Rent prices will increase significantly, for example, in the 450 thousand apartments rented from January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example the company CPI Byty which owns in Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments, has decided an increase of up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new rent increase will be brought before the courts by the company.
Regulated rents that people pay in nearly 300,000 apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk with rum and fernet. The beer is out of fashion and acts very slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from the parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who are drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in the hospital for recidivism are no exception.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions from the children's departments of hospitals.
“Beers or wines are no longer in fashion because it takes time to be drunk.”
“The trend is really towards strong alcohol,” said Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the children’s department at Horovice hospital in central Bohemia.
"When they manage to grab a daddy's bottle in the cupboard, it's sometimes wisky but it's the fernet and vodka that prevail."
“Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not smell it,” explains the Head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman for Motol Hospital, also agrees.
“In general, it’s rum or fernet.”
“Today it’s alcohol in fashion, especially in elementary schools.”
“In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought home,” Jurinova added.
According to the head of department Pelikan, seeing drunken children between the ages of thirteen and fourteen at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he practiced ten years precisely in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from large areas completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized like this four times.
“She started her career at the age of twelve when she was brought in with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in her blood plus a mix with ecstasy,” the doctor said.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it didn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter was absent for 48 hours," he said.
It is precisely the parents' unselfishness or their unusual tolerance for the fact that their offspring indulge in drinking that is the main cause of the development of alcoholism in children.
According to specialists, however, we are not talking about dependence, in its strict sense, for children.
"Under the term alcoholic we hear a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that follow from it but that we do not find in children."
“In those who repeatedly use alcohol, it is more of a socio-familial background that is significantly unfavorable,” explained the Head of Department Pelikan.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with a grâve intoxication requiring hospitalization are integrated into the statistics.
Drunk children who are after emergency care brought home by parents or police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit down and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pelikan there are three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of the witches, the Saint Sylvester and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink in spite of bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
“Of course I experienced on Witches’ Day an admission of 7 drunk children at once,” Pelikan said.
The drunken child who spent the night in the hospital in rehab under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffers the day after the "wooden hangover".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better off because they have a great evening and then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them."
“They are only amazed at where they are,” adds Pelikan knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and intensive care bed hospitalization can go up to tens of thousands of kroner.
“From time to time, I have applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their drunkenness has cost and that they could spend the entire summer in seasonal work to pay off a single evening,” Pelikan added.
However, according to him, the health insurance companies in their declining management, which should recover from the parents the expenses related to the care, do not deal with the cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, against which the Ministry of Defense exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off on Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the manufacturer of Casa-EADS aircraft is headquartered.
This is the first time aircraft of this type have become the property of anyone other than the Czech Army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that were up to now in service in the Czech army and were in flight condition.
The remaining three devices are single-seat versions of the L-159.
They are currently stationed at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Ministry of Defence's press department, the physical departure of Vodochody's planes is still unknown.
"Single-seat L-159 aircraft planned for the exchange were taken from long-stocked aircraft without this causing any additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
“The L-159 T1 two-seaters were traded in the state,” said Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seater since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 single-seaters into two two-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS is committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
“The contract clearly states that the one who takes L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used to train pilots from NATO member countries.”
“It’s therefore up to the one who takes into account how to achieve this,” Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for tenders and contacted EADS directly.
The defence management argued that the exchange would ensure the future export of the L-159 to foreign countries.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aéro Vodochody and only used 24 of them, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will likely have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the planes should have been chosen as part of a European-wide call for tenders and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
Longer index than ring finger is a sign of low cancer risk
Men who have an index finger longer than the ring finger are at a lower risk of getting prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men before age 60,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including combining it with genetic risk or other aggravating factors like family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Great Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right hand index finger shorter than the ring finger.
For them, as for the 19 percent of those who had the same length of fingers, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the ring finger the risk fell to 33 percent, however, for men before age 60 the decrease in risk reached 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely testosterone that helps the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of this study but does not seem to him, it seems, that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow this Thursday morning.
On roads and sidewalks, there is mostly compact snow, the cleaners worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and cars and the D1 motorway in Brno in the direction of Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Automobile Club Central (UAMK) told the news
At the 91st kilometer a truck was crashed, at the 93rd two heavy goods vehicles collided, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometer towards Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should exit just after Brno at the 190th kilometer or go by Brno and then enter at the 182nd kilometer in Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometers was formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
In Prosek, for example, queues of cars are created, Sterboholska street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams are delayed for example on the line between Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and Place de la Paix (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the Prague Crisis Staff is due to meet again.
The railways and the airport are also experiencing problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove 7 rapid links due to snow.
Lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne airport has been closed since Wednesday 11am at night until 5am.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rolling, but with heightened vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impassable, on the road to Brno there begins to be in places gusts of snow and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass some communication routes in the places placed higher.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected places.
Until now are closed the axes: Rusinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, you may need to send snow plows and snow cutters.
At the moment we cannot estimate when they will be rollable.
On the road to Hodonin caution is de rigueur in the region of the White Carpathians.
On roads that are, with regard to the protection of nature, maintained only by the sprinkling of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell the most in northern Bohemia, with, often, up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
Snow is gradually disappearing in the Czech Republic.
Americans have a new “smart weapon.”
The US military has sent a new “smart” weapon to Afghnistan, known only as the XM-25 code.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and “will change the game” for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super-accurate cannon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with an accuracy of a few meters.
The special ammunition of 25 mm caliber developed for this rifle and containing a highly breaking explosive, actually works like small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode in contact with the target but also at any point of its ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, wall or ditch.
He is also not protected from above and when he falls on a deadly rain of shards of steel, it can put him out of action as well.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtains a precise point of sight, according to which he corrects his site aim and presses the trigger.
"Let's say you aimed at 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the weapon loads and shoots at the distance of 543 meters plus or minus 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu Group is moving its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer to Astro Park their place of work which is currently located at the office building of the Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As claimed on Wednesday by the giant specialized in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far in the Marienbader square of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Strasse street in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman said that in the medium term, the group is expected to add another 100 jobs scattered across the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and Astro Park's open-plan offices are better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said: “Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with a remarkable infrastructure.”
He says connecting to the airport is of great importance to a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the Frankfurt municipality, Mr Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its implementation is an important boost for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
Early on, management informed the municipality of this intention.
“It goes without saying that we offered our help to this company,” Korwisi said.
However, the friendly relations could not have changed the computer manufacturer's difficulties with the owner of the Place Marienbader building.
Ultimately, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a question of preventing such an exceptional place from remaining unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building in Town Hall Square, used until now by Fujitsu and the neighbouring "small vertical", as well as the rest of the buildings in Marienbad Square, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
The result of a joint project by the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the Town Hall, which attracted much criticism, not only because of the impressive layout of the surfaces that once served partly as parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, investment rating and advisory firm Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, Frankfurt-based German real estate group Immobilien-Chancen acquired the buildings occupied by Fujitsu along with the Morgan Stanley real estate fund, and a year later these buildings were sold to Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
Fujitsu Group, headquartered in Tokyo, considers itself the third largest supplier of IT products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad. Other subsidiaries on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters have taken to rent in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses among other things the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronics and Electrotechnical Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is having more and more trouble.
Internet service provider Amazon has evicted the site, which specializes in revealing confidential documents, from its servers.
This may hide political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
Wikileaks founder Mr Assange is apparently staying in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is attacked with ever more force.
The group of cyber-activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is likely staying in Britain, according to newspaper reports.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
“Freedom of expression in the land of freedom,” the cyber-activists behind the revelations said Wednesday via the social network Twitter.
Earlier, the company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the release of the secret diplomatic memos, the cyber-activists used Amazon’s Web Service (AWS) to reach the greatest number of accesses to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: “Fantastic, our dollars are now being spent on caring for people in Europe.”
When freedom of speech is a problem for Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
CNN television, citing Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon has banned WikiLeaks from using its servers after an investigation by Sen. Joe Lieberman's aides.
The chairman of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
“I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier given Wikileaks’ previous releases of classified information,” he said.
At the same time, Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the platform’s use of servers.
"Wikileaks is acting in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous manner, putting our national security at risk and putting our lives at risk around the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
“No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks disseminate the contents of the stolen documents.”
Wikileaks founder Mr Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described Sweden’s prosecution of him as intrigues orchestrated by his critics.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats have been made against the site.
“Calls have even been made for the murder of Julian Assange.”
This is why Assange is particularly concerned for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly reacted to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s adviser said on television, ironically, that Mr. Assange should be “killed” and that Mr. Obama could “use a Drone.”
Meanwhile, a controversy has erupted between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for U.S. President Barack Obama, called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for ordering diplomats, and most recently leaked, to engage in espionage.
“I don’t know exactly why we need to take care of the opinion of an individual who owns a website,” Gibbs says.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website.”
The U.S. government is now completely testing the protection of its databases.
According to a White House statement, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Anti-Terrorism Center, has been named responsible for fighting the leaks.
Mr. Travers is tasked with implementing the “necessary structural reforms” made necessary after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to verify the ways in which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they are ever threatened by WikiLeaks revelations.
"We have made every effort to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are prepared to protect them if necessary.”
University of the Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice come from?
Glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, that is to say in German the somewhat old-fashioned ice confectioner, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated display case using a spatula, arranges it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, one does not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice, can not avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The ice cream maker founded the Ice University in 2003 so that the ice creams taken out of its machines would meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
There are also special classes on chocolate ice cream over several days, as well as hands-on sessions in the private ice cream shop.
In the midst of the midlife crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk realizing their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, a teacher of art education from California, is passionate about the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the country of the Industrial Ice in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business management consultant and after a few years she wants to get something special out of this nerve-wracking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian maid came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Glacier master Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice.
Not only is the good flavor decisive, but also the silky suppleness and the good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation the icing on the cake of the national and, in general, southern superstructure: "Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats everything to 85 degrees through an electronic program, and then immediately cools to four degrees.
He then opens a tap installed on the machine: a pasteurized white base cream comes out, the foundation of all kinds of ice cream.
The trainer is immediately beset with the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can one give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr Luciano warned against being misled by the spirit of the times.
Those who speak only of ice cream "made from natural ingredients", may have used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example guar seed flour obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only you have to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will eat nothing but ice pellets.
Some changes to the base mass are permitted.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
The master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that one acquires in the fruit or confectionery department of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to give you dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in the recipes of fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it becomes a yellow cream and constitutes, when cocoa powder is added to it, the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must move on to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice creams are also subjected to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice does not necessarily have the taste of walnuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The kiwi ice cream, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
“Only a balanced mixture correctly enhances the taste of an ice cream,” says Luciano.
The making of ice cream is a calculation exercise: if you use peach puree with a lot of sugar, you need to reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (winegrowers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the calculations easier.
Icemaking no longer requires as much physical intervention as it once did.
It’s not just the basic mass automatic manufacturing machine that helps.
There is also a device in which the available ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it creamy and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automations, slight breakdowns are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo smears himself with fruit puree from head to toe and, thus, splashes his fellow students when the control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "such an incident is likely to occur during each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that is experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has cored the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now being made by the Testbiotech expert panel, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said in Munich on Wednesday.
There are reports that the chairman of the Efsa Group of Experts for Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, as well as other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi lobby group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in developing the EFSA test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest, according to Mr. Then's criticism.
The requirements drawn up correspond verbatim, in paragraphs, to the positions taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the mark of the industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities based in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has reported a conflict of interest.
A senior member of EFSA recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period, changing sides.
Not long ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union control authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicions from both the German Federal Environment Agency and MEPs.
However, the EFSA does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
There is an opinion that all reliable data, including industry data, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Efsa are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Kuiper admits he works for the U.S.-based International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI).
This organization sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together experts from, among others, science, industry and policy to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feeding test in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the impacts of genetically modified maize cause in the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only the isolated proteins and not the whole genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results.
“If we don’t look for the risks, how can we find them?” asks Mr. Then in an accusing tone.
This is also the view of Ms. Angelika Hilbeck.
She has been researching genetics since 1994 and currently works at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are hardly any researchers who are not linked to societies.
In the view of the companies, the critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck says that "the industry controls security research".
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell got it, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was a demo.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and started demolishing much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart's central station into an underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the protests led to the halt of construction work.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (shellar limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse cobble poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He got a few fragments of it.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically declares: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He claims that when he sawed it, he smelled the cigarette smoke.
He does not yet know what he will do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The traces of the Stuttgart stones lead to an old ammunition depot of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappear into the landfill,” he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guardhouse.
He said he was subjected to insults and threats when newspapers reported in September that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for whole days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to keep using the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project later carried one of the stone parallelepiped weighing on average 80 kilos whose value is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir in while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full truckloads.
About half are still piled up in the forest, the rest have been sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, individuals.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could get into the trunk and trailers.
These scandal stones from Stuttgart have long since turned into "Muuerle" or limitations of herb beds.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," says Mr. Rongen.
"If it weren't for this political component."
He enters his all-terrain car, goes around his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He went on to study law, which he dropped out of, and later began to study biology before eventually becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a career.
And a stone lover.
It stores 40,000 tons.
It is a treasure trove all over Germany.
He claims that he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's refracting.
Artfully carved sandstones are laid on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the Marienbrucke bridge in Dresden".
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he says enthusiastically.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
It shows a pile of the finger: Red sand stone, previously part of the Karlsruhe train station.
And so on.
"Nice travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the tribune of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt coming from the police prefecture, the reddish granite coming from the cathedral of Saint Blasien, the tuff coming from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that once the stones were hand carved and moved using simple hoists and carts pulled by oxen, he becomes quite respectful.
“It would be a scandal if such a legacy were torn to pieces.”
He did not become rich, much less rich.
But this quarry now employs 14 people. In addition, stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener settled in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s rewarding,” says the waste recycler.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are stones to save, too.
Talent struggle to conquer the high potentials
The counter is experiencing a lively affluence.
16 students are scrambling to buy salmon rolls, tomato sauce and white-meals.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
As part of a kind of idea contest, they have to talk business about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, know the company Volkswagen.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go hand-in-hand in the competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as much as possible in the amphitheatres before they arrive on the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify exceptional talents in the context of practical projects and to retain them.
On the second day of the workshop held at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automotive group is cheering on the talents.
A young lady in the staff department shares pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs to young talents; she shows them the paths to access the group's premises.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
“As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know the students, take a closer look at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play as collaborators.”
According to Mr. Saddle, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which we try to attract students.
"In the past, the focus was more on the professional project," says Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much more bitter.
In goods sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting through a multitude of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and above all court the highly qualified workforce.
It is above all graduates from engineering fields who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the VDI's forecasts, the vacuum for engineering positions will increase further.
Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, an audit, accounting and consulting firm.
It organizes expensive events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the United States in this way.
Participants can also visit KPMG subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The person who has to participate decides in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the crème de la crème of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Dykta, the means used to find high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the talent hunter that is Mr. Dykta, the count seems to be there.
“Until today, we have kept in touch with everyone who took part in a similar action last year.”
“Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their requests to our company soon,” he says.
Apart from the direct appeasement carried out on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises proceed in a very conventional way by participating in professional fairs where they engage in brain hunting.
"We try to reach graduates by participating in trade shows."
“For example, at the solar technology fair,” says Sitha Stabe, director of human resources at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
Ms. St-be is aware of the issue of succession.
Currently, 35 positions are being advertised on the company's website.
“Right now, it’s very difficult to fill vacancies.”
“It’s expensive and takes a lot of time,” he says.
Another way to establish contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to carry out professional internships or to write his end-of-study project with us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
“Often, a large group can’t do that,” says Ms. Stabe, head of staff.
Money no longer plays the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute is an annual honor roll for German employers.
To this end, he asks employees about their level of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the framework conditions of employees.
The Chief of Staff, Ms. St-be, hopes that this placement will enhance the company's image among job seekers.
“I think candidates rely mostly on external assessments when it comes to a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, that means first and foremost taking internal action.
“The best way for an employer to make themselves attractive is through their own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's image within its own workforce.
“Satisfied employees are the best messengers.”
When employees are treated well and identify with the company, they advertise their employer to friends and acquaintances on their own.
“It’s like playing in an orchestra,” Kriegler says.
Obama puts a stop to new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, a state in the southeastern United States, in the coming years.
The Washington government has issued an equivalent ban and, thus, definitively canceled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is currently prohibited.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in April is the reason for this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with this accident, which has cost the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to authorize the realization of new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents of this solution thus want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastating oil spill in golf has not, to this day, been definitively resolved.
The British oil company, which is facing multibillion-dollar claims, is at the center of the charges.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar lifted the freeze on drilling after the platform exploded.
As a result of this decision, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security guidelines, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after numerous corruption accusations, is currently undergoing extensive reforms.
At the same time, Obama announced he would remove lucrative tax niches from oil and gas groups.
Stakeholders in this industry are now publicly warning that the flow of feed into the Gulf is significantly lower than has been the case so far.
“The government’s goal is to curb the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector,” according to the result of a current survey conducted in the sector by the audit firm BDO, before the drilling ban imposed on Wednesday.
In fact, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows what exactly will change with the regulations."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is oiled brown; it emits a smell similar to that which exists in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live off theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist told reporters, "you still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian attempted to photograph a young man sunk in muddy water to the chest, as well as the greasy streak that surrounds him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the burst of water to the color of the rainbow.
You can't see that the basement is full of brown sheets of crude oil.
On the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom recounts that, in the past, she collected shrimp in whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil spewed out of a pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach the fishy waters: Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The full extent of the devastation is evident when one travels through the mangrove swamps crossed by streams.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat splits out cringing brown water, and anyone who dips their hand in it removes it completely covered in oil.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the ground like sticks of licorice. The isolated palms sadly let their palms hang.
We look in vain for the swarms of birds, as we usually meet in wetlands: As soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence falls on this paradise of yesteryear that resembles a gas station by the smell it emits.
"What is happening here is a war on the environment," said Mr Celestine Akpobari sadly: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The Ogoni region has been a besieged battlefield for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, who later executed it. In 1993, the Shell Group had to halt its production activities in this region because these had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the return to the Ogoni country is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 wells and 7000 kilometers of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are untapped, because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
Every few hundred meters stand in the water of steel trestles like bizarre sculptures: We very affectionately designate "Christmas trees" the heads of boreholes.
They are up to 50 years old, most are eaten away by corrosion to the mark.
Akpobari believes that a drillhead of this nature breaks into pieces from time to time, as a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion litres of oil have flowed into the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil equivalent to the amount that flowed into the sea during the Exxon Valdez super-tanker accident 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Who should bear the responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
Shell says sabotage and pipeline siphoning are responsible for more than 90 per cent of the pollution, while environmentalists consider drilling head explosions and perforated pipelines to be the main causes.
In 2008, US researcher Richard Steiner accused the Shell group of applying essentially less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of pipe failures is “even higher than elsewhere”.
Some forms emerge from the mangroves in a place that, seen from a distance, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of cambouis and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with cambouis up to the neck.
A fire shimmers under one of the many barrels that sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without reason on the site must be spotted: a small clandestine refinery.
We heat the crude oil in the barrel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
First, the gasoline enters a container through pipes, then, at the end of the pipe drops of kerosene fall and finally diesel is obtained.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-litre diesel barrels every day: “It brings us 34,000 Naira,” about $22.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell for less than the ridiculously low price of just 40 euro cents per liter of diesel: because they get their raw material for free.
According to experts, the country is losing at least 16 million litres of crude oil in the entire Niger Delta, and the oil pipelines are being broken down by the “protectors” who are piercing the network of oil pipelines across the Ogoni country.
Only a small and quite insignificant portion of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include high-ranking politicians and military members, load the lion’s share of tankers and sell it on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers that the debate on whether to attribute the environmental catastrophe or rather the subversive activities to the population or the lax mode of production is purely academic.
“If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen’s lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries.”
But in the meantime, the Ogoni’s relationship with Shell has deteriorated so much that it was only a question of the group’s withdrawal: “perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will prove to be better.”
Then Michael gets nervous.
“It’s high time you got out,” announces the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers mainly from the north of the country want to benefit like all Nigerians from the raw material.
“From every point of view, this damn thing made our country fall very low,” Akpori said.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major safety issue.
Examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that can lead to “catastrophic reactor failure.”
The airline Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the manufacturer of the reactor.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas had obviously had more luck so far: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian authority in charge of aviation safety found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft presented a serious safety problem, and it warns of a possible lack of construction.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of the oil line, said in a statement published Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a “catastrophic reactor failure.”
This applies to engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Quantas’ Airbus, which was due to land in Singapore on 4 November, is among them.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British engine manufacturer.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, giving her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas' director, Alan Joyce, said his company would seek damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts were removed and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the ignition of oil that is causing the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors are now to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that more safety tests will be carried out on the superjumbos which are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue is considered significant enough to inform all parties involved.
After the emergency landing of its aircraft, the airline Quantas had grounded its entire fleet of A380s for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa has replaced, as a precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-story aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall throughout the country causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the entire country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany shivering: In freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow in the night of Thursday, which leads to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On the National A7 in Flensburg, winter service personnel worked on a permanent basis, but they could not cope with the snow that was constantly accumulating.
In addition, violent gusts swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Marine Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal waves to occur on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snowpacks on motorways and federal roads have led to serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the central weather alert Meteomedia announced the purple alert level was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In some places, 30 centimetres of fresh snow have fallen as strong and cool winds have dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused traffic interruptions and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions of rail traffic have occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, trees fallen on the railways, catenaries or needles destroyed.
In Saxony, the inter-regional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train bound for Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the train’s 165 passengers with blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds swept the roads.
The snowfalls have resulted in numerous flight cancellations at Germany’s major airports.
According to a spokesman for the standard and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport says 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers stranded at the airport are no longer numerous, despite this barely 400 beds are made available to them.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a railway crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the layers of snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car rolled on a slippery pavement in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists are announcing good news: The snow will still be soft and powdery, but it will swirl in case of light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by strong and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, down to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to newspaper reports, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank just embellished the group headquarters: The twin towers in the Business District have been modernized; meanwhile, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group is clearly seeking to recover the costs of renovations and it is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not state the reasons for the planned sale.
He said: “We are checking whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or to sell them, and to rent them again at a later date.”
This is how Germany's largest financial institution already sold its head office shortly after.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for 272 million euros from equity holders and then rehabilitated them.
The transformations aimed at energy optimization have swallowed up, according to some indications, about 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector of activity estimate the value of the towers, renamed in the meantime "Green Towers", at about 500 million euros.
According to the spokesman, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the miners who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have had a thought for buried miners who have been reported dead as a result of several explosions at a mine.
The bodies had not yet been reassembled because the security situation at the disaster well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
Twenty-nine miners between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the disaster well, but no traces of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue teams were able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that the miners no longer had any chance of surviving.
Until now, the bodies could not be reassembled.
Today, family and friends held a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a bright sun at Greymouth in the south of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, we installed 29 tables on which we could see the names, helmets and lamps.
Photos and personal belongings, including clothing and surfboards, also had their place.
Flags were flown at half-mast in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the memorial that New Zealand had raised hopes that the miners would rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pits, said he cannot resign himself to accepting his son's death until he sees his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Miners of South African and British origin also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescue workers began to put out a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand’s South Island.
Police prefect Gary Knowles told reporters that when the masses of explosive gases are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter movie an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the ancient genre through his film, "Walhalla Rising", epic fighter.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he filmed “Walhalla Rising”?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators looking for a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal methods of assassination. When he is in a bad mood, he tears out the intestines of his enemies without waiting.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the one-eyed man does not say a word about his real name. Even the other characters let out, at the most, at the turn of a sentence or two, some terrible cries of agony.
Otherwise, we say nothing and feast in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland that is the setting of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
This would be ideal plus mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travellings.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the publication of "Pusher", his trilogy relating to the drug dealer fierce and full of style, like a kind of Quentin Tarantinon Danish, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to the cinema of art and essay.
Most art cinema fans have to experience horror in the face of the brain spreading all around and the intestines.
Lovers of action films die of boredom, when the one-eyed man embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to be silent.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any distributor of films in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that have earned some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It’s not about dialogue in this film, it’s not about coherent action, it’s all about atmosphere, a feverish dream turned into a film.
The spectator cannot escape it.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with icy images and a dismal soundtrack, but above all with an elusive hatred that springs from the heart of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully beside the one-eyed, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the one-eyed hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by transforming himself into a warrior, is perhaps the devil's envoy himself.
It represents rotting, but perhaps also, just for those who are, anyway, rotting.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, whose finality is annoyance, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, let alone submit to the agency’s controls.
On the night of September 5-6, 2007, around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest city located nearby is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in the IAEA documents, because it is about the reactor that Syria has built, it seems with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a U.S. intelligence briefing, the CIA, dating from late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighboring locality, el-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium, which would make it possible to manufacture atomic weapons.
However, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video featuring fuzzy satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the probable location of each reactor component before the destruction of the plant which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even the interior of it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be commissioned, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is hardly more information available than at the time, and even, with time, the mystery is getting deeper and deeper.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was sure Syria had built a reactor at al-Kibar, but had little clues that it was developing “an active nuclear weapons program.”
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and only talk about a "presumed reactor", even though they consider the CIA's presentation to be "plausible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as at the IAEA.
Asked how he makes sure he’s dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior U.N. diplomat gave only a terse response in the summer by saying the IAEA had “documents sufficient to ask questions.”
The Syrians certainly hurriedly removed the rubble from the “unused military building” and methodically leveled the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former chief inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium in al-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial contractors from a Member State showing the moment directly following the attack; it appears that these are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
This makes it impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found at the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the particle analysis, calling it implausible.
Since then, damascus has refused any discussion about it, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection at the al-Kibar site and denies access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel remains obstinately silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently said: “We will never comment on this.”
For example, the investigation into this case has been dragging on since June 2008 without a result being reached and is "increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem for the Agency", as a senior Western diplomat on duty at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna acknowledges, finally it is a serious violation of the nuclear weapons treaty.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the other three facilities which must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
To date, inspectors have not indicated which facilities are involved, nor what their function is or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper "S?ddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also from the names of the neighboring towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington has identified these localities and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspect objects.
It may be located in or directly adjacent to a military base, which is exactly why Syria is denying IAEA inspectors access to all three sites.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is in fact spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it is intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that has attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, that vehicles have shuttled between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could “serve for fuel production.”
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities", such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible assumptions about where uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed to make the bomb would have been separated later.
It is not known whether the rubble, which could hide traces of high value, was stored at all three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with dirt are gone, no one will have information about where the rubble is stored.
According to the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometres from al-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River, examined in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
Recent analysis of satellite photos taken for the famous Jane's Intelligence Review, the former IAEA inspector, has linked them to the reactor in question.
Satellite photos show, however, that Syria undertook earthworks at the three suspected sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began to demand access to those locations.
It may be a coincidence, but it did not help to rule out suspicions.
According to diplomatic circles, the IAEA spent several months developing a plan for inspections to be carried out there, which was intended to enable Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time invested shows the great interest of the inspectors in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also flouted this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who for a few months has been talking about what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
IAEA Director Yukiya Amano, who had to offer these inspections, has already spoken of “an option I am open to in the future,” but he still hesitates.
This means an enormous risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented in it have no desire to see the situation escalate.
on the other hand, as this diplomat who gives to reflect: "To this would it serve, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in Time of War
It’s been going wrong since Angelina Jolie made her summer debut as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it’s a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing more is known about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
There is a persistent rumor that the woman, a Muslim woman, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the Yugoslav War.
The Bosnian women’s federations immediately protested, and in response, some of the footage scheduled for shooting in Sarajevo was moved to Hungary at the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet the actress.
A few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
“The meeting must be held in Bosnia,” Hasecic said.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie’s script says quite a lot about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic’s organization subsequently recommended to the UN High Commission to withdraw the status of Goodwill Ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, by the way, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of his script, granted filming permission in Sarajevo after some hesitation, but it is unclear why it did not come later despite this permission.
The young author assures herself that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a lot of effort that she learned about the Yugoslav conflict and that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give all the parties involved the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it is vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. It meets again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serb concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
What is still a big difference with the version "a rape victim is in love with his executioner".
That Jolie’s movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: by illegally putting this scenario in the Net, like many others before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, things are going well with the Irish.
No trace of consternation.
That’s why the local team overly dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy against a background of loud music, they soak their feet.
Cork's Baileyu-Pub in southern Ireland vibrates because players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls from a distance of three meters into beer cups of the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "beer pong". The winner pocket 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to attend in January in Las Vegas the world beer pong championship.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really do not go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the terrifying question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not in his plans. In January, he will conduct job interviews in New Zealand.
“I have a strange feeling,” he says.
“The country of birth is so far away and I don’t have a job there.”
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man with a smile.
Due to the bleak outlook at home, two of Tanner's three sisters have tried their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, while her brother Colin is now a computer consultant in London.
Young people are leaving: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even forecast a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts are realized, it will be a flow of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish enjoyed great ease, grief now takes over.
The economic crisis is, however, particularly affecting young, well-trained Irish people, who have so far experienced only moments of happiness.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there is excess money.
But in the meantime, three out of ten people under 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times widely publishes the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes adrift."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the opportunity is leaving and so is our country for a whole generation.”
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students Union, sees a bleaker future because the government is just throwing powder in the eye and offering no prospects for young people.
“They’re cutting minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old said.
She sees how her classmates cling to each other from one unpaid practicum to another.
She says that her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
“It’s a sad and depressing thought.”
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this theme positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" which offers full support on the theme of "working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for newcomers to the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," the official said.
His website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a hassle, but it also guarantees freedom and fun.
For the past six months, O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing left to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector and Germany.
A fashion house comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects in Hannover or Berlin.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his native country, as he participates in an additional work shift, in order to be able to complete the repayment of the credit contracted to build his home in the native country.
“The situation is already a bit crazy,” he said as he crossed the threshold of his home for the first time after a long time.
“I’m making money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I practically don’t live anymore.”
He bursts out with an embarrassed laugh as he walks through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-groomed front gardens, expensive cars of big brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O’Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, financed 100 percent by the credit.
“These were moments of madness, without a doubt, the money was easy,” he says.
Is he afraid that everything will fall apart because of credit?
O'Donovan thought for a moment, popped hot tea and said, "I have no children to look after and I'm young; even everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The building engineer does not like the laments he often hears lately.
“No one should go hungry, our situation is not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island,” he said.
“Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe it’s what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
“He was back after seven years, and in Ireland, life just went on.”
This idea pleases Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and find out how life goes elsewhere.
He already has a few years of work in London, which is why life in New Zealand should not be so easy for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that worries him in recent days: the party to be held on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid she won't be able to turn into a farewell party.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he said, drinking a long sip of beer.
"Goodbye, it still seems worrying."
“Let’s call it a relaxed goodbye party, gathering a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games.”
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarmetro survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it tracks changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from this year's survey results, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the fairly sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also rose in Mexico, where the economy recovered from a sharp drop in output last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with how their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase over 25% in 2001 (Chart 3).
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but up sharply from 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shook support for democracy.
If this held up during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America experienced only a brief recession and benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year, to 32 percent.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress.
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crime has worsened.
It was only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say they or a loved one has been a victim of a crime in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the rise in support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela agree (and 80% support private enterprise); even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the biggest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the disaster-stricken and fear-stricken country.
Polling boxes and a new ballot were presented, ballots scattered in the goutières, polling stations ransacked and intimidation
The polling stations opened late at night.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced by the January earthquake, were wandering around to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several suspected favourites, denounced the fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, considers the event as "a fairly good election in many ways".
Observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have cautiously stated that they "do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidated the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is expected in January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no discernible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority to have reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, there were fears that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 ID cards, needed to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are high.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
In the weeks after suddenly becoming a widow, Argentina’s President Cristina Fernandez benefited from a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate by 20 points, to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Still, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on Ms. Fernandez’s choice, visibly in mourning, whether or not she abandons the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
Ms. Fernandez's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But opposition is divided, and the situation has sunk into disarray following Kirchner’s death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement in power have joined Ms. Fernandez.
But after chaotic sittings (where one MP punched one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress doesn’t have to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, giving the president even more room to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and union wage demands see this figure as close to 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which has falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Ms. Fernandez now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been boosted by high world prices of Argentina’s agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the growth boost following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernàndez is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its maturities in 2001.
Now Ms Fernandez seeks to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 trillion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve surveillance by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund would provide “technical assistance” to design a new national consumer price index; which looks like a prelude to INDEC’s clean-up.
It is not clear whether Ms. Fernandez wants to stay in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer by her side.
If it does, it needs to win support from the middle class, among whom kirchnerism is highly advocated.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have receded.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, without noise, many of her husband’s policies.
Half a Hour for China
Taiwanese voters are moving towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters turned up on Nov. 27, or 70 percent of eligible voters, to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is seen as a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings about the continent, having forged innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganisation of relations with China proper since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just right.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party won three of the five town halls, he failed to win a majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which leaned toward Taiwan’s complete independence, won nearly 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If this had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including raucous campaign trucks and mass rally flags with girls dancing in minimal attire.
A mysterious assassination attempt was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of KMT Honorary President Lien Chan, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Oddly enough, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to harm Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner in the election was China.
It was striking how absent the issue of the mainland itself was.
Instead, candidates gambled with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from stirring up anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is in response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan’s economic survival.
Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation as to whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
The Beijing government can be expected to continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back to the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let’s start at the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP has reinvented itself.
Two years ago, his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur in favor of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is making every effort to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP candidate for president, as was Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it too can engage with Beijing.
Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided their talks can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a “trustworthy alternative” to Mr. Ma’s hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will find it difficult to choose among its potential candidates.
The KMT needs to do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite tremendous economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman said his office and local branches will be revamped.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan’s support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, “the point of no return has already passed.”
Grammy Award nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "best new artist"
Do it at the request of a president, and people are required to read it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer hand-picked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of this year’s Grammy Awards surprises with a far-reaching nomination in the category of “Best New Artist.”
Considering Spalding has been a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination remains somewhat mysterious but is consistent with the Grammy Awards rules that an artist must release no more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skillful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line at Spalding compared to the meteoric success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Award voters by taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy Award voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio’s “Historicity” in the “instrumental album” category, a ride on an invigorating thrill of a recording that was one of last year’s top favorites.
Among these Iyers, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a raucous New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also bowed strongly toward a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society, familiar with steampunk, won some well-deserved recognitions in the grand ensemble category; competing with Billy Childs Ensemble's rich chamber-jazz and eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" from his octet's live was a fine example of this bassist's democratic hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey Lead in Classic Categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd annual Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes from musicians and composers from around the world.
At the top of the nominations are "Deus Ex Machina" by Michael Daugherty, for piano and orchestra, with five "yeses"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yeses".
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo P?rt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman’s Madolin Concerto is also in the running for an award.
Classical nominations are spread across 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for Classic Producer of the Year features five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classic album are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - The Art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de loin" by Kaija Saariaho of Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin of the National Orchestra and Choir.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition include Pert for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Paert's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute work is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he wrote the 15-minute work especially for the mandolin performer Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
“I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a lot of scales and rhythms from North Africa,” Dorman said in a phone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalist-solist nominees; here they are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonova, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic blends category, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots: My Life, My Song"
The Temecula mosque project won the approval of the planning commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public, often passionate, testimony.
Critics attacked the project claiming it promoted both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
“Many good people came to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha’is, you mention it,” Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
“I’m proud of it, as an American citizen.”
“It shows that justice prevails.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
“They just have very strong voices.”
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the center, with roughly evenly distributed speaking time, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no more America,” one speaker wrote.
“This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand.”
“America has fallen.”
Planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 families has co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet in Mediterranean style architecture would be composed of two minarets and would rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32-hectare site on the Nicolas Road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the city council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and possibly beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why it's very special, even though it's far from being a really 'foreign' form of life," said Paul Davies C.W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But the researchers found that the bacterium, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“We’re wondering what’s still possible,” said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important when it comes to searching for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, Anbar says.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery “shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms might be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the ‘standard’ set of elements, which we deem absolutely necessary for life, might not be fixed,” said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Institute for Planetary and Spacial Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
“This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
It was not a chance discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, she speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances might be able to substitute one for the other.
"Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is really similar to phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms struggle to distinguish these elements separately."
“But arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work exactly like phosphorus; it gets inside and somehow gums up the work of our biochemical machine,” Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of Earth’s existence, she says; thus, the researchers hypothesized that early life forms could have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways of forming life, not just the way life on Earth was formed in the beginning,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen show dogs were found in Compton
The other two show dogs out of four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower have been found, Los Angeles County Sheriffs announced Thursday.
The four show dogs - two akitas and two Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express pickup truck in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday evening, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department spokesman Steve Whitmore told AFP.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore says.
"They are in good shape."
“They were returned to their rightful owners.”
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood and under what circumstances they were found.
"An investigation is ongoing."
“We don’t want to say it,” Whitmore said.
“We are following orders.”
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached to provide a comment Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were safe, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were missing until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the national championship "AKC/Eukanuba" of Long Beach, where they planned to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the “AKC/Eukanuba” exhibition, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple’s nearly month-long dog show tour.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs – a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton spaniel – who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so that the dogs could have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van was stolen at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM is waiting for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York on Thursday officially praised the creditors’ “pre-packaged” plan that roughly $5 billion of debt would be wiped out; paving the way for the entertainment company, which is 86 years old, to focus its efforts on producing and distributing movies and TV shows.
With Thursday’s decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, no legal hurdles remain before MGM to refloat under the tutelage of Entertainment Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general managers of what will be a lean studio.
The staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase enters into a $500 million credit facility to finance MGM's new operations and productions.
It is currently distributed under license by the investment bank, which itself runs into $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio’s restructuring process began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to place its finances as it could not afford to pay interest of $300 million per year.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a turnaround expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to resolve MGM’s financial difficulties and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed at the end of 2009 to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the additional $2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be redone as the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan that, after months of disagreements and internal debates, was finally approved by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially exited bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies received multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already secured $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have raised $375,000 a month for their corporate leadership services, will receive a $4 million “success award.”
Barber and Birnbaum plan to restart production of MGM, which has released only one film this year, and put together an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros.
The studio must make a separate loan of $265 million to $275 million to finance its share of the two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18 percent of MGM's debt, has attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the main candidate for this year’s most wonderful toy is the iPad, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft’s video game system, Kinect, both can make a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jumping ropes, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors – Wal-Mart, Toys “R” Us and BJ’s Wholesale Club – to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore’s Law has evolved, this year’s tech toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And button battery toys are on the rise, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are stuffed toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when you squeeze them on the stomach.
One pressure is equal to one note, and a second allows you to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Be careful: once you start pressing, you can’t stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and up) is the best choice.
Drawing inspiration from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can do lunar dancing thanks to its innovative articulated feet with locking wheels.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computer-based educational toys.
It’s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and up), with a backpack filled with quiz game cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve binder.
If you’re suspicious when your child is holding your smartphone, here are three stand-alone alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 year olds) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 year olds), this is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older cartridges.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, for ages 3-7) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card entry that allows family photos to be viewed.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and up) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks in line before time runs out, this is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
More and more, toys have some kind of online connection.
Based solely on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a Club Penguin online pet, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for ages 6 to 12) which includes a coin marked with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child receives enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
It can be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and up) is the latest micro-robots with button battery.
The fake bug moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It’s fun to do a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a softer side to policing in China
Tang Shenbin walked a city square as an urban sergeant in training by sternly inspecting his nerve charges, issuing orders in a low voice with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan – imposing public order officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and penchant for violence – to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"Stand up straight!"
"Be sharp!"
Show them, he says, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely spent their teenage years in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-coloured jackets and trousers, were standing by.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned to the ruler.
Four neat hats perfectly perched on top of hair tied by a striped knot in blue and white.
“Personally, I think they look average,” Tang said, disdainfully.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city required all new recruits to have a higher degree.
Guangdong province traded the gray-green uniforms for a supposedly more engaging blue.
Wuhan, Central China, replaced the blindfolds with the loud way: In 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by casting black glances, firmly for half an hour, until the peddler repackaged his belongings and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its urban street police with 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, their curves and their young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have trouble catching eye on China’s underground urban brigade
And for good reason, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media portrays the news from a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei province beat an observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and posted online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without emitting blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon hawker was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available via online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained to assault street vendors.
“Chengguan has marked the government,” China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after yet another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a "true complete cleanup."
Skeptics say the approach is a long way off.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News questioned whether women had real jobs or were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district’s announcement required female candidates, aged between 18 to 22, to have a beautiful figure and “the five facial features in the right order.”
They must be larger than average in size, 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is mandatory.
Officers said the work was physically too painful for women over 25.
“It’s their image that’s important,” a district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable; these are the height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "inner qualities."
The women of Chengguan are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city's district management office, does not agree with this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job postings for both sexes.
This is the case of the requirement relating to the order of facial features.
That this means beautiful is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, disabled or disfigured people should not apply.
“We can’t let a limp person or a hunchback come and serve here,” Zheng said.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has appleted cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She doesn’t consider highlighting her appearance as sexist, she said.
“Do you think I look sexy in that uniform?” she asked disillusionedly.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old dimpled colleague, says, “Our job is to present the image of the city.”
They do not object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they have greater career ambitions than simply chasing sellers into the back alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team confronts a dozen street vendors who quickly move on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many buns or bowls of tofu as possible before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you must go."
“We’ve told you many times before!” said Ms. Xu as a salesman fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle-cart.
Agents describe their duties as monotonous rather than fiery.
“It’s pretty much the same every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies after-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exposures of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after false rumors spread that chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen chengguan police and officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from placid Baoguang Square, where female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle was screaming scandalously.
A 15-minute standoff followed before the grim-faced policemen nudged their way to their vehicle and drove off at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men’s team, stayed behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 or older - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Li said in a neutral tone.
“Most of the time, it’s the audience that starts.”
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Attorneys for the Justice Department have lifted criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, stemming from a case related to an aide from a former campaign and his efforts to get lobbying work for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers said Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2012 until the scandal surrounding his case made national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign’s office said he was “very happy” with the decision, the result of a year-long investigation.
The honourable senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action by the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign’s lawyers said the Justice Department had “informed that Senator Ensign is no longer under investigation and that he has no intention of maintaining any charges against him in this matter.”
The Department of Justice has refrained from commenting on this.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there was significant evidence that Ensign had conspired to violate a federal criminal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get lucrative lobbying work to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's case with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as treasurer in an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator with Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole for one year.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to be at odds with the so-called lobby revolving door ban.
From the evidence that has been made public, “there appears to be prima facie evidence of a plot to violate and materially violate revolving door law,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
While the department's judge declined to explain the reasoning that led to the Ensign decision, Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared to be wary of political prosecution after a number of high-profile setbacks by its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop charges against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the citizens' executive director for accountability and ethics in Washington, a advocacy group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basicly says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s senior lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call on Monday from a Justice Department prosecutor and a follow-up the next day, telling him that the department was not seeking charges against his client.
Ensign’s team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed Wednesday in a statement, “had acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecution.
“I’m not comfortable getting into the details of my discussions with the Justice Department, except to say that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the $96,000 payment by Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "marriage" the Department of the Interior on an issue in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to schedule a meeting on behalf of the airline after he engaged Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth-ranking Republican in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intends to seek a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were typing away in the rows of the courtroom.
Every minute they sent reports of horrific testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages about the trial of the rape case and the children tied to their bed in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Hayes’s lawyers have already filed evidence in court that outlines arguments of appeal, likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial – as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists – created a “circus atmosphere,” a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury was misinfluenced by the public’s passions.
The application could push appellate judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
“I have experienced this in this trial; I think there is a real danger that the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms is undermining the human rights to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, a lawyer for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
Trial judge Jon C. Bleue of the State Superior Court laconically rejected the claims in last week’s judgment, saying the media was “carefully controlled” and there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that doesn’t seem to be the last word on the issue.
Courts of appeal have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland osteopath Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, arguing in its ruling that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the TV show and film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have said that the appeals courts seized to review Hayes’ conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules may be needed to manage the courtroom communications, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media” in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily enforced.
Professor Donohue says some appellate judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
Twitter’s case is just one of many described by Hayes’ lawyers, likely to be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes was allegedly harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome photos of criminal scenes during jury selection.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of prosecutors, and improperly pressured a verdict by making the unusual decision to get the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was being discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They maintained that the computer media continued to fan the flames of emotion in the case.
“The daily stampede of tweets from the media, cameras and journalists outside the courthouse,” the lawyers wrote, “did not resemble anything that had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally.”
Their focus on coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said the claim that instant news was more incendiary than press releases delivered more slowly was a luddist view that would impoverish the court’s policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said appellate courts were often drawn to arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Hayes’s lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they made reference to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard’s conviction due to media coverage of the trial and said they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents Sheppard v. Maxwell’s case of the 21st century.”
Can civility bring divisions closer together?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a harbinger of true bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the big issues that need to be addressed during the “Lame Duck” session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit commission was just as civilised, despite the political differences that remain among members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect transcending the ideological gap; but which, however, still divides the members.
This is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a period of trial and mutual testing with a view to obtaining signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That’s why Tuesday’s meeting and subsequent comments from attendees unveiled a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, expenses, healthcare or entitlements, both parties remain miles away.
Still, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
“There is no doubt that things have changed in tone,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now alongside the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“This is inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions, and then they fade away.
That's good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the "Lame Duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of it, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on extending unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s meeting at the White House, more optimism hangs over a possible agreement on the issues raised during the “Lame Duck” session, with the ratification of the “New START” pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
“Once the things that need to be done are done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations,” he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
“I consider most of what’s going on between now and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present at the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they must try to live up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Committee which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, pushing back the retirement age and cutting spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member commission to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have struggled to reach that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected officials, suggesting that there are few grounds or willingness to compromise on tax issues, at least today.
Galston plans two phases in the fights between the White House and congressional Republicans.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama over budget, taxes, and health care; followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
Whoever is judged a loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization is greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and congressional Republicans than there was then between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more substantial election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
leaked US documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and passes some of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service make huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the “vertical of power” – is taking its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yury Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there have been few clean-ups since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have consistently denied corruption charges over the years; and he has won several defamation lawsuits over these charges.
In September, he told a Russian TV channel, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s to be thrown away, it’s anything.”
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information set out in an embassy report; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be up to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some to call it “dysfunctional” and claim that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government, according to the embassy’s note.
Criminal elements enjoy a “krysha” (a term used in the criminal/mafia world that literally means “roof” or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor’s office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level."
“Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a void in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services.”
The report says that the FSB is brewing money from the biggest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
A source, he said, “explained that business owners in Moscow understood that it was better to get protection from the MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law.”
“That’s why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high.”
The note notes that although the collection of money is extensive, the protection itself can be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev mentioned the fight against corruption several times, but he admitted the lack of progress.
The embassy note relays reports of men bringing suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
“In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats,” Georgiy Satarov, director of Moscow’s think tank Indem, said in a recent interview.
“But he’s part of that bureaucracy.”
“He is not part of a political class because there are none in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of corruption would amount to more than $300 billion per year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked from at least to the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the note of the US embassy, which was only realized yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow’s failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted angrily to remarks that U.S. diplomats had leaked by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
“The problem is that it’s about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest with you, we didn’t suspect it would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics.”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with decrepit, low-quality concrete walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School spoke about the man who built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader; and he cared about his people,” said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in northwest Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, Anlong Veng’s long-standing loyalty is finally called into question.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, taught the Khmer Rouge history to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly headed by the United Nations, handed down its first sentence against a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as “Duch,” to 35 years in prison.
In the face of these developments, anxiety has increased among Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng; complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
“For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil.”
"The situation generates divisions within families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-U.S. government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia’s border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurgency that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrillas from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating with the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 pending trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge veterans have sunk into poverty, common in rural Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officers have kept their positions as local leaders in exchange for laying down their arms, they are unskilled farmers with low rank and record.
“These people received very little follow-up after the capitulation,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They are soaked in the regime’s agrarian utopian ideology.”
“They were raised in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to provide for ourselves.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court has also caused concern here.
The court is expected to begin sentencing Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, early next year.
The court's mandate is to try senior leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it did not say whether it would prosecute beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation has turned to 64-year-old Im Chaem, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers are believed to have died.
Recently, on a scorching evening, Im Chaem was returning from work at the field near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows over the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
“Cambodia is at peace and stable,” she said.
“If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecuted multiple suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
“Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, of the documentation center.
“Reconciliation in Khmer terms is about reconnecting broken pieces,” he says.
“We need to put these pieces together so we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, “A History of Democratic Kampuchea, Composed of 75 Pages.”
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education’s history textbooks, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he came home with the book to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he says.
“They are wary because they don’t know exactly how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Leang said.
But public forums, the manual and the court are starting to make an impact, he said.
However, the Khmer Rouge still have a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a path, invaded by weeds and dotted with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot’s body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside mobile phone saleswoman, said she didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday and later that day she planned to walk to Pol Pot’s final resting place where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of military-grade uranium
The government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide.
The deal was leaked in a joint statement issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The US government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations were carried out with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarus research center.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the matter from about 500 pounds, according to an official who raised the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at Obama’s initiative; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to get an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
“I’m really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“It proves to me that this process works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security advocacy group.
Clinton called the deal “a very significant, important step” by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world within the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military grade uranium and low enriched uranium,” Lukashenko said.
“It’s our product... We’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
“We’re going to use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
Belarus moved closer to the United States a few months ago; however, showing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million on its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
“Careful coordination and organization have been implemented to build trust,” leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an energy department official specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates by the James Martin Nonproliferation Study Center, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is aiming to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential renewal.
“While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential to improving bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens,” she said.
The government has made no objections to the CIA flights.
The government has made no objections to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the daily El Paus, which add that the first vice-president of the Government at that time, Mara Teresa Fernàndez de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised adequate vigilance on foreign planes that crossed Spain".
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe accused a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, a meeting was held between former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council's report "surprised Zapatero's government offside" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence theft over Spanish territory.
“They only want to be informed” to avoid being “taken off guard,” Aguirre said in a cable.
The holder of the Ministry of External Affairs at that time, Miguel ângel Moratinos, informed the ambassador that the Spanish Executive “wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity for influence”.
In turn, in January 2007, Attorney Vicente Gonzalez forwarded to the Embassy the fact that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating material, no sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless shown its concern for "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of CNI o of the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maneuver the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the US ambassador and the Minister of Internal Affairs, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid comments of a fiery rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expressed his concern for the PP's action in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that Zapatero’s government has condoned or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. government,” she said.
The parricide that went to confession complained in a network of the "overwhelming" of being a mother.
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernandez is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname, which she used as a child, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two from Noia, the village of Coruna where she comes from.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, one must know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with industrialist Ivan Tez.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Soon after they separated, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him have the DNA test.
We discovered another boyfriend soon after that.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring municipality.
With him, she lived together for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the job market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, we hear that their idyll has fractured, they have separated.
In March 2008 she was in Menorca, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and upset about the fact that I came to work there."
“When I told him, it seemed like a good thing, but of course, he now takes into account what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
And then she talks about a mobile message she had just received: “I want you to come home this month or you give me an address to send you the child.”
Ella complains, “If he doesn’t like it, let him leave the kid with my mom, and I’ll take it when I get home,” she alleges.
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I am leaving, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to show up at a workstation so as not to lose it".
She said that if all went well, she would have taken her older brother with her.
“He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him in my life with another person if that person is not my mother,” a dubious intention, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When she taps him, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and had supposedly been murdered on the 10th, is dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but he is not happy on the other."
“On the one hand he’s with me and he likes this place a little bit, but on the other hand he goes to school almost every day.”
She talks about a trip to Majorca.
"He'll go there (the child) a few hours in the summer and so I save a little money from the babysitter."
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you'll come."
“Alberto says he sent you I don’t know what videos to email, you see, when he wants, he finds me, shit.”
On the 30th, another: "The child is good, he goes in the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On his current partner, Victor, there’s one: “He’s putting money in front of me.”
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the now-blocked MySpace universe, where her name was "Muki the Prison Liberator."
"Terror to the Galician (epigraph)".
The last man who lived with her, Vigil, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn’t want to think that everything had gone so that she hadn’t told him that she was a single mother.
Monica entered the Palma provincial penitentiary yesterday, coming from the Minorca judicial detention centre.
The ex officio lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the facts happened, "and she also did not intend to harm the minor".
Before that, she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and putting his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor asked for a psychiatric test.
People's Party members would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9 seats.
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and deputies recorded in the last autonomic elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation obtains in these committees normally doubles that it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the autonomic elections of 2006, they had obtained 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384.091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, desired a diversion of votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, the analysts of this formation have calculated the fact that, if there would be a general election, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and PSC would lose no more than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - it has three now - while ICV would keep one MP or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for the municipal committees, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and populars agree that PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the socialists would also not get the majority the opportunity to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be fanciful for this formation to lose its representation in the mayor of Barcelona - it is necessary to get the 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current Socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP registered only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
Populars have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
At present, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerien detained by agents of the General Information Police of Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups Al Qaeda, between which "Tigres for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the author of the Bombay attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" has "been debilitated" the apparatus of falsification of Al Qaeda at the international level and "therefore, its operative capacity".
Investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years it was active in Catalonia, could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that were integrating the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its “combatants” could cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network kept operative in Europe, that is why in the investigations participated, apart from the Thai services, other European police units, that is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days similar blows to the one recorded the night of Tuesday spent in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerien Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another was held in Thailand, with the capture of the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Buttij and the Thai.
They were the ones who ran from Bangkok the cell located in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of young men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connect the detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, even though the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless we must remember the fact that a few days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia a few thousand dollars were sent through a transfer agency that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after by the integrations of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have seized a large amount of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia Sanchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which boil down to giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to approach half his mandate.
The president of the Catalan popular arrived at the rendezvous with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be liked, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstain in the vote of the investiture.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in the Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are done in Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investiture "it would be necessary to eliminate all sovereignist and independenceist speeches", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the leader converges wants to submit even to a referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to make the political apparatus of an autonomic administration very exaggerated and the elimination of the tax applied to successions and donations.
Details of the negotiation on Mas' inauguration will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do it with Joan Puigcerca (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
Geriatrics says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
Olot centre owners do not rule out the possibility that their night nurse has killed more than 11 elderly people
The officials of the geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Girona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible in the interval that he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself accompanied by the lawyer of the center, Joan Casada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be that to be able to exercise the charge against the responsible" for the dead but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for failing to detect in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the victims’ parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day on he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - because he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied yesterday this situation and mentioned that "the lack of measures can not have been at any time the cause of what happened".
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “in this case there is only an indication of recklessness on the part of any other person other than the accused.”
The person already baptized as the "Angel of Death" confessed the day before yesterday 11 assassinations and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused him death by injecting him with a sober dose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative tablets.
The director of La Caritat mentioned that it is difficult to control the access of the staff of the center to medicines.
Insulin injections and the sedative cocktail had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to relieve the suffering of interns, used to kill them.
But laboratory tests will clarify if Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the interval 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of murders admitted, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change of the manner of killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of the justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet’s threat yesterday that “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
The differentials of the devices have closed with force and the shares of the European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should also not underestimate the ability of the ECB to err and the euro has barely recorded an increment, which is a worried signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way that it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by closes of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose fear.
A month ago, ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
Bundesbank demanded the completion of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary measures of liquidity in the future and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, it is hoped that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and that the quarterly open-access auction will be maintained at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond purchase programme will continue and even give a signal to intensify it.
If they do not fulfill the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
Just as during their meeting in May in which they claimed they had not even considered buying bonds and they have collapsed the markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a further collapse in the market.
Yesterday the auction of one-year bills in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million at 5.28% compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal dropped 30 basis points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland holes have been published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Even though Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval for its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a hotbed of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension ahead of the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest Beethoven's hymn of joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment ring to the ears of investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange has suffered the 4.5%, double that of the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was swift and radical, and we are enjoying the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will be benefitted by the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will resolve with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain asking for a Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line we don’t need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in available liquidity, triple that of March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to the markets sine die.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "apart from being, appear".
Courage, we can get away with it!
Eulen's president will challenge Vega Sicilia's advice asked by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the family Elvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, because he considers it "no law", the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, solicited by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the holding firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesus David and Maria José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control of a share of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company of business services for companies does not seem to be willing to give in his dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors in the meeting of shareholders of January 18 this year whose contestation is registered in the Trade and Companies Register.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrat No. 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of thunders within the family Alvarez.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the assembly.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Alvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Alvarez as a "desperate appeal by the plaintiffs of his five sons to try, through a procedural arguty, by clearly defrauding the law and abusing the right, to validate and correct the radically null assembly on January 18," according to his official spokesmen.
This argumentation will be the basis for that, once the assembly takes place, to be challenged by considering that it is "null by right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a patrimonial company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David’s sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless solicits usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the application for challenge for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with secret Siemens weapon
Software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last few seasons, past November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the champion's ability as a driver, the German Sebastien Vette, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 we speak of the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
It is in fact a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives far removed from high motoring competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly lines from manufacturers factories all over the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, accurately simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 plant allowed Red Bull to create and execute “in a few hours, almost in real time”, the modifications, changes and improvements detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 teams had an average of 10 technicians on their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four vehicle upgrades each season.
In the Red Bull team today 180 young professionals of high qualification work who, equipped with powerful computer equipment analyze and project all kinds of modifications on the cars.
The head of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the elements of the Red Bull cars except the engine, which is the exclusive responsibility of Renault.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can shift from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this insanity of technological development there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this assignment is 580 people, including two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The Red Bull Formula 1 hero, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and the notoriety zero.
The plant’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&D progress in the case of race cars brought 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while drivers bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computers, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP to Install 20 Own Stores with Local Distributors in Two Years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 zones already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain Vice President Helena Herrero gave as an example the revamped store located on Barcelona’s Gran Via, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to establish 200 branded points of sale in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first ones opened were in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, although she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of the exclusive furniture of the stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of facility staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive network of shops claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, post-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering world-class pilot program that solves the possible problems of HP’s IT equipment as a guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Holland).
“So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days.”
"This system is designed especially for MPEs and users, because the big companies have already contracted technical support services," Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bets on ‘stealing’ a million customers to rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell’s managing director, Jaime Guardiola, thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse in interest margins, which will be attempted to partially offset with increments in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million private customers, its task to accomplish.
Sabadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011 with a three-year maturity.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to resort to public subsidies from FROB, is to gain a market rating by capturing one million new private customers - 700,000 if we deduct those who can leave the bank -, its great task to accomplish, because until now this bank had spoiled more SMEs and companies than the private customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 individual customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market value to individuals is 3.5%, while to companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as the goal, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, because the financial crisis has disrupted all plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its Optima master plan, established four years ago, even if initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for one more year.
Clients who let the savings banks out will be his main goal.
During a breakfast hosted by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a “difficult and transcendental” year.
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the liability war – which penalizes margins – is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and credit unions pay for its issuances to obtain liquidity is already shifting to the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
“The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a credit pressure factor.”
“We didn’t tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDia on November 22 and 27-.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector now “is to increase commissions”, but “there is a competitive framework”.
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "we will solicit larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he said.
He says capital needs are “increasing enormously” and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market in the collection of funds in the case of new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporal closing of the markets, he diminished the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that we cannot issue, but contrary to what happened in June, we can obtain short-term financing through rest, which mitigates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the caisses
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is carried out.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been carried out, we can not say that the incorporation of Cajasol in the group of Banca Civica is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most of it has been achieved completely; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation too," said the leader.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Leaders and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarieta explained that the process of concentration is carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out within the deadlines that have been set in the past, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphatised.
“The move from 45 caisses with an average of 28,500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a trial without equal in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be compliant with Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of rather unhappy opinions on the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of serosity and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remind that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" the world and he attributed to the people who doubt it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can stay very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has started a process of concentration "very important" and "goes at the greatest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has done well from the stress tests that BCE carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin opted to stay in the euro, but it set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have provoked a government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of assistance to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the Lotteries of the State.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe Gonzalez, joins Chancellor Angela Merkel’s criticisms of her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which shocks with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even if now it sounds like science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, nearly a 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines to countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were boosting deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought we had to do (tax austerity plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second blow from the central European country was when Merkel hardly prolonged the decision to save Greece.
From that moment it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and published it were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expresses a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union treaties to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time force private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although a little watered down, was approved and, in the following months, we should attend the reform process of the Union that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it doesn’t think it will cross.
And it tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not agree too much, from that date on, the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves in default of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany warns us that we must follow a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a question of reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we are asked to do is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring greater tranquility to us.
And let us seize the opportunity we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard it in this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after Saturday’s meeting with the big companies and yesterday’s announcement of the new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel’s criticism, the path has been opened to the thesis that it is necessary to put the house in order.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to be moving it.
And among the possibilities we are considering, we cannot exclude the possibility of abandoning a monetary zone too full of countries that are not very serious.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The tricks similar to those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the desire to escape punishment.
The expulsion in principle by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match of November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has made a lot of ink about the anti-sports character of such behavior and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the match (which their team already clearly won), both players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually be leader of his group, the two players will fulfill the regulatory sanction during the next match of the play-off against Auxerre and will be able to move without cards to the next phase.
In the end, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned the team's coach Jose Mourinho with two matches and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, unwritten but followed rules, of this sport.
Part of the debate that emerged in the case related is due to the fact that this had as protagonist a team from the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem displays nobility and honor and which in past occasions has fined its players for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds one more episode to his dilated and provocative history of his technician histrionic.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of conduct not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is to say, whether with these actions one commits a fraud of law; because, in fact, they are respectful actions with the sports regulation, but seem to elude its meaning.
The question is to consider the type of harm they cause to sportsmanship.
One of the assets that includes sportsmanship is the physical integrity of opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been endangered, that is, there has been no violent play.
Another of these assets that are alluded to with the correct game is to prevent the undercover players team from unfairly taking advantage of the opposite team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not accommodate what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the referee.
They waited and they gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of benefit that offenders receive from the intentional misconduct examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a position of disadvantage to the rival and one does not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action supposes the fact of leaving their own team with fewer players.
And that’s not a useful strategy for the next game either, as the club could not count on these players.
Obviously the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players complete a penalty match and move on to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first round.
So, climbing the ladder is not so clear that it is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to sportsmanship, which is still part of strategic decisions that promote the maximum profit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (this would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), otherwise they chose rather the moment in which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding the penalty or running away from it.
Even if the boundary between genius and fraud of the law is diffuse, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises because of two factors: because there have been two self-expulsions and because of the way of transmitting the director to provoke them.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the touron and the lottery, when December also comes back the dinner groups before Christmas which continue to be the oxygen balloon for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have led to an offensive prices adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, coincide the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
To complete complicating the accounting, this year's calendar (as the night of New Year's Eve falls on Friday) concentrated requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 17th and the 17th) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying from their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all ask for battle prices, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauracia de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
“They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prices,” he says.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at good prices and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the tranche around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey at various establishments in the centre, there was a collapse of requests for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the conjuncture, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has assumed more advance reservations, even from the beginning of November.
“We did our utmost to maintain the same prices from last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they said.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting a surge in billing since the second half and good, though focused, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
On their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, like the Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies inviting their employees back and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a bit.
On the part of the Fecasarm employers (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, confides in the possibility of starting to see the final of the tunnel and maintains that overall the reservations are "animated", even if the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
This is true, the hope for the festivities has not waned, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan’s nuclear program causes great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at “a faster rate than any other country.”
Wikileaks filtrations confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State filtered through the Wikileaks portal confirm the enormous concerns in Washington over Pakistan’s nuclear program.
Aside from the enlightening and tasty details of the content of the conversations and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that the cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, “declines” and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons “at a faster rate than any other country in the world”.
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assembled, but are stored in components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson said in a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise is short and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is envisioned, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep guard.
“Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs,” said Yuri Korolev, an expert at Russia’s Ministry of External Affairs, during a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The new documentation filtered through Julian Assange’s portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan’s high degree of nuclear armament production.
An embassy dispatch in May, which calls communication with Pakistan "frustrating," said: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; offers of help remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, that he make it clear to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end with tacit support for terrorist groups".
Hunting the Chief of Wikileaks
Obama will number to a senior counterterrorism official to avoid further infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
This one is not new, otherwise it dates from November 20th.
And this one has nothing to do with the latest filtration of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents of the United States but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks’ founding lawyer Mark Stephens says that “the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
On the 20th the international police force with headquarters in Lyon (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after having received the authorization of the authorities of that country.
Thus, all 188 Interpol countries were told to identify or locate Assange “to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Even though Interpol cannot give the order for the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red notice a free route for arrest -- which the national police force must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The move outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder was willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities via video conferencing.
They also recall that Assange solicited and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of the security of Stalin.
“It seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter said.
While the world is looking for him – and in Australia his mother is defending his son’s innocence – Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday he gave an undetermined interview to the editor of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he demanded the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to the American graduates they are spying on at the UN by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign,” he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request “ridiculous and absurd.”
“I’m not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has instructed a senior counterterrorism official, Rusell Travers, to prevent further document leaks.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to reduce Assange’s importance contrasts with the views conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, the congressman who from January will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations “to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance.”
Even further afield, Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, was forced to reconsider his statements after he said Assange would have to “be murdered.”
“Obama should turn it into a goal and use an unmanned plane or something like that.”
One person who did not ask for an apology was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
“Anyone in the government who filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything not to be executed would be too lovable a punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcercs seeks peace in ERC with winks to Carod followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercus seems to have found the recipe to solve the umpteenth internal revolt inside ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half the votes.
The party president is aware of the fact that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it can absolutely not give him headaches that he had with other currents extinguished.
That's why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercaes announced yesterday that more than 200 ERC national advisors will be able to comment on its continuity in secret.
By ballot, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to convey a certain penalization vote to the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews he claimed that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "Bulgarian" would not be good either.
The people close to Carod demanded of the president a little more than making his position available to militancy, a gesture that was not worth it when Puigcercas controlled the maxim organ between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap until May.
For this, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the national council on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcercàs in exchange for the latter's promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider a sure fact.
The ERC leader admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that his goal is to make sure that once and for all the organization is able to wash its laundry room with the family.
In this line, the article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog results symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcerca, the holder of Innovaci thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, of which he points out two.
The first, "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, include new figures that come from the adept sector of Carod.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC once and for all liquid assembly as a working mechanism.
Thus, he defends a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcerca team, which has already struggled in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 convulse instructed management to revise the assembly model in a specific congress to reform the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, because the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this topic.
Now, without critical areas on the lookout, the time might be right to take it back and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the state of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to MILENIO of the state of Mexico.
Between the murders are mentioned these three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
During the penultimate month of the year, there were 390 deaths in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases we mention that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlan, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the blow to the head, apart from feet and hands tied with a cable.
The next day, the corpse of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the luggage port of an abandoned vehicle in the street Mixtecas in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlan, of the municipality Naucalpan.
Very early Thursday morning, the four, the owners of jointly exploited land found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the thorax, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Near the body was found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day later in Nezahualcumyotl a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight shots as he left his house to start garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a gunshot impact to the head each in the settlement of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the forehead we found the corpse of a man on a lonely path of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body we found a bullet hit with a 25-caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina settlement.
The emergency corps conducted a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
Residents of Tepotzotlan alerted to the discovery of a corpse that was located in Peca Colorada, with their hands tied behind it and their eyes blindfolded.
The man had a wound produced by a gunshot in the neck.
In the middle of the month the execution of two men was reported who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the Atizapan municipality of Zaragoza, at the same time two death warning messages were discovered with the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes settlement, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Incorrect.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the corpse of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket was located, being in principle identified with the name Mario Rios, in agreement with a message that his executioners had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman were detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with his image.
Towards the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the edge of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet holes and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads enrobed and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what happens with those who do not align".
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustin settlement.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcumyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancon settlement and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juarez.
Near him, the agents found a bristol with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The country’s representative in COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce until 2020 between 40 and 45 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, China's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and reconvert its industry.
Indeed, he said, in the last four years his country has inverted $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but it will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all of these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the targets being addressed in terms of reducing greenhouse gases, he said.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with government and local governments to achieve energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction goals.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans under way or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented for the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for changing incandescent lamps to energy-efficient lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific adviser to the government of that country on climate change, assured that China’s efforts have been greater than we think.
For example, he explained, China’s per capita greenhouse gas emissions are three tonnes per person, while in the United States they are 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historic contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase a 20% energy efficiency in the last five years and plans to make another similar around 2020, he said.
Legal Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN has detailed that the former panist leader has the right to address the National Commission of Order to claim what right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vazquez has assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos has been legal and that the former panist leader has the right to address the National Commission of Order to claim what right.
In the interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Commission of Order of Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to address, if necessary, by making a complaint to the Commission d'Ordre of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance for the presidential candidacy on the negotiating table.
Nava Vazquez said he was convinced that Accion Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections on 4 and 5 December, where a successor should be elected.
“This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for now, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and has achieved its goal,” he said.
The panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why “internal competition does not frighten us; on the contrary, “we savor it and make us stronger,” he said.
He said no doubt the council will be able to elect the best leader that Accion Nacional needs for the next three years, so it would take over "to the person determined by the council."
“I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the office of party president to any of the five.”
He planned that the revival recorded by the party in the past elections of July 4 will be reflected on the next dispute, even if "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"For the moment it is a question of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that there has been "a lot of hope as far as they are concerned, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to the expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticisms of President Felipe Calderon because of his speech during his four years in government, César Nava asked the prists to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderon; let them begin to defend them; let them come out of the 'cabinet,'" he said.
He said that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditory, because in the country there is no gag, and even less censorship.
Obama Promotes Law on Twitter for Undocumented Students
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama met today at the national rally to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal Twitter social network account.
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His short message keeps open a cybernetic link with a broader document that asks the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on legislation is imminent.
“With a vote that we hope to see soon, now is the time to listen to your voice,” he said.
The message was leaked after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any legislation if the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding continue.
Such a blockage, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is solved we can set an aide for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
“We all agree that we need to solve this tax problem before the end of the year.”
“I think we can get an agreement at some point in that direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he will ask for a “debate closing vote” for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, even though the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they stayed in this country for the last five years and they were accepted by an institution of higher education or by the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the support of a large number of Republicans, at times when the project’s partisan organizations are actively lobbying to secure approval of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe, and Susan Collins, and incumbent Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of office of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, of Texas, but they said they would not support it on any other occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his stance so far.
Even though the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the bigger hurdles of the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature we put our finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasure of Language was a walk in which the participants displayed the narration
"Sex in the language, I understand, but... finger on the wound? what do we hope of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and which this time used the subtitle of her question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound "... puts us in the embarrassment", gently launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which participated Valenzuela, Sergio Ramirez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garcàa Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa in first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "wound" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only leads in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "patience is not my forte, it may be my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who took his breath away in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is open in reality, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "on the wound I could only know that it is who is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very connected.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramirez also exhibited a ravishing narration that he titled Praise the Invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous sorceress who touched clouds, brought back people who had gone far or repaired virtues that a damsel had lost, a narration that is then turned to speak America, the great news that had from the beginning its own chroniclers and quoted Bernal Diaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of the narratives of the capitans.
"Cervantes who invented us all (writers) made fun of the false witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that lacked even modesty."
Nevertheless, he stressed, "crazy and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with lies, it is no longer known what part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is called the Cervantes tradition.
“It is because of his legacy that we are what we tell.”
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the invitation of the FIL with his round table The Must on the Wound.
The Cuban Puerto Rican has hers on the great plague of social violence that her country is going through - and Latin America shares - produces disputes about trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening is finished with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis Garcia Montero who also emphasized "this must on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at great speed also in regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind each affirmation there is a small no and behind each negation there is a small yes".
“To be masters of our own feelings and to be masters of reality, we have to nuance: and nuance means many times putting a finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturbing the powers that prefer a world in white and black,” he said, inviting to recover the meaning of writing.
Romano on the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are in addition two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find between them a marked contrast by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach three times the decisive series, even if so far he has not put in the spotlight and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentinian ended up consoling himself with the medal of sub-champion, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santist strategist arrived at his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with whom he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closing, he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered another setback, as his team made an equal 2-2 match against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty series he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed by 11 meters and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén has lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to detach from the curse to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even if he says that for him the institution is more important.
“I want to be a champion, I don’t want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important,” he said.
“The only lesson we can learn is that until the referee whistles the final, we can’t celebrate, we’re prepared in the line, the players are prepared, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run and I think that’s a lesson, before the end of the game we can’t celebrate.”
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never try to arrive at the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad trick, sometimes it is the emotions or anguish to hold the title in our hands, it has served us more in our hands.
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to report to the Visa Applicant Service Centers (VACs) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have some advantages for aspirants, among which the following are mentioned:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for processing the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a one-time payment that will cover all three services.
The current fee will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 in the case of visas with application (this includes visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Persons wishing to renew their visa will not be required to present themselves for an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only present themselves at the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken in the CSA, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay there for less time than before.
Likewise, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA to announce discovery of alien life
The US space agency has cited the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. at NASA Headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present who will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life,” prompting speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if its living conditions are improved.
It appears to be a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment thought to be too venomous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses Arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our volunteer atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the findings in tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
The conference will feature geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (Saturn's largest satellite), under the prospect that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patr?n 'block' opposing
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of “bipartism” is possible, it is denounced.
The 60th had just settled when in the Congress appeared an opposing bloc led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesus Manuel Patron Montalvo, which declared itself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" in the Chambers.
Before starting the session of the installation of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'toned' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, "bipartism" is initiated because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Directory chaired by PANist Salvador Lopez Brito and Luis Antonio Cirdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these reforms in an institutional way the political marginality on the part of PRI and PAN is constituted.
He mentioned that in the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme starting from a political will and if they do not, they will be enslaved again by both parties and in this way will end the opposing coalition.
“So far [the opposition coalition] has arrived, that’s what I’m looking at, because we are excluded from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez, from Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patron there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot allow, he continued, that the Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now “duopolistic”.
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is an eternal bipartisanship in Congress.”
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues so that they are more numerous, the Convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that now the Congress has morphed into a “goblin” in between, alluding to PAN and PRI.
“Before there was only one party, now they divide it into two.”
Mr Montalvo asked to respect the member's personality, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave by cupular agreements out to 5 who will probably be 9 deputies, now to the five that we see, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to look for a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform that they have made, that they have decided, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200 million more for the "supplier"
The City Council of Mazatlan pays another cheque to the questionee owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 thousand pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Town Hall.
With it, the amount paid in the second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipe, this last check number 9258447 was issued last 16 November for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in concept of "liquidation of account suppliers".
Treasurer Luis Miguel Lopez Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many checks will still be issued to Camacho Palazuelos.
“We didn’t buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the latter on November 16.
Even if the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the forecasts of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to avoid that other governments use its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25 Noroeste had published a revision of the checks that the Town Hall issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennium of the Mayor Jorge Abel Lopez Sanchez, the Municipe paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing checks of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be cared for
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions of the roundabout S?nchez Taboada in Mazatl?n.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the roundabout Sanchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in bad conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be cared for and new activities must replace others that tourists find bad.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come to walk there and they see the disorder and avoid nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to shut down a business one day and they don’t know the fortune you’re losing, elsewhere they weren’t doing the work for so long and without proper planning.”
The hotelier José Ramon Manguart Sanchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the Town Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent this from happening again, how to do it, so through preventive maintenance and only do the corrective," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live there and the Town Hall must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlan.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the attention they need and this type of fact highlights something that is known to all, the interview is necessary."
Raul Llera Martinez, Under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlan is urgent, because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Luckily Mazatlan offers a lot of historical and cultural sites and places that should be ordered first, cleaned up and put online to make them attractive to be able to add to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP asks Congress for results
Eduardo Duvalos, President of the CEC, proposed that MEPs take the great responsibility of being an example for Sinaloa because of the various provocations that face it.
The business sector in Mazatlan is calling for a dignified and agreement-free labour legislature between the parties and the government executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday we installed the 60th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 deputies from PRI, 13 from PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the governmental Congress is a clean and engaged management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat themselves.
Eduardo Duvalos, President of the CEC, proposed that MEPs take the great responsibility of being an example for Sinaloa because of the various provocations that face it.
"We hope that MPs actually exercise their right, free of agreements between parties because the custom is that they make pacts to look after their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask that they certify the commitment to build the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making progress.
"We will ensure that they do dignified and above all committed work with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
The president of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, José Ramon Manguart Sanchez, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is that of pushing and adding forces while seeking the economic growth of the State, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that in a way will stimulate the generation of workstations.”
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Government Tourism.
"I understood that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that directly rivals the agro-industry."
Apart from the need to classify resources to detonating tourism projects that help give safety to the state and update the Alcohol Law that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for King Mage
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a kid.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaas, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day to day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' for sale on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a monster truck and for his 8-month-old younger brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests waistwear for a year.
“He said to me (José Alfredo), ‘I’d like to have this monster,’ but I said ‘we’ll see, my son,’ because he was very dear,” Cayetana recalls sadly.
For the older children, who was at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is wearing size 12; Isaias, 10 years old, is wearing size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, is wearing size eight.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair the size of five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the On Search King Mage campaign, by giving a toy or money to the reception of Noroeste.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The raids took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used to produce drugs.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Sûreté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were scheduled to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
The raids followed a lengthy investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the Estrie regional investigative unit of the Sûreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Régie de police Memphrémagog, took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says should solve the problem of boats loaded with illegal migrants, is clearly going to be defeated as the three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
“I stand with a party that created the granite under your feet,” said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, as he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals argue that the bill as proposed, which would allow anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because he is attacking the wrong target.
“We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do,” Duceppe said.
NDP immigration critic Olivia Chow dismissed criticism that her party was not firm enough on illegal immigrants.
"New Democrats agree to take action against people smugglers and that's what we're doing through another bill, the C-35," Chow said.
"We don't support the Conservatives' bill because it targets refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“Canadians are massively telling MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a doormat.”
"They expect Canada to take strong action," Kenney said.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections in the event of its rejection.
One Conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that each member who opposes would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit does not have unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public commission of inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, maintains that this idea is not new: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation of New York on this subject last January.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday’s announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on police services in Quebec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
Public safety critic Stéphane Bergeron called the announcement "a rabbit out of a hat" and "a tinkered solution on the corner of a table."
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You'll see the result when we announce it, he just says."
“We are aware of this problem.”
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
“The more Mr. Charest persists in not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide,” he said.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the École nationale d'administration publique.
To break this deadlock, he suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
“We need to be able to expand the auditor general’s mandate,” he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the cartons of the Charest government.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of the operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
The federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his colleague from Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently studying some amendments related to this file.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit biker groups, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several rivers remain under heavy surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has hit several parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated pre-emptively.
In the evening, another slip would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rain fell on several regions, or 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimetres of rain were expected by Thursday night, depending on the region.
Areas north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
Since this precipitation must be added to the snowmelt already accumulated in some areas, there is concern that several rivers may overflow.
Flood warnings were issued Wednesday night by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, at Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and of the Oak, in Lotbinière, were the object of flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy precipitation has led to the overflow of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was washed away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In the Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on alert and is monitoring the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
On Wednesday, the Quebec Flood Prediction Centre issued flood warnings for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, l'Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec City radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback in front of the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) for controversial comments about social assistance and Haitians as well as his crude language on the air.
The CBSC found that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinions, but that some comments contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and coarse language that is not appropriate for programs broadcast during the day."
The Commission also found that a discussion of suicide, including the release of the names of two persons who committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Front commun des personnes assistés sociales du Québec.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the issue were inaccurate.
Facilitators must present strong rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, the animator Stéphane Dupont had felt that suicide is a cowardly gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of 'Dupont le midi' addressed a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
No blame has been laid on him.
The last dispute concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then engaged in a media face-to-face that had generated a lot of reactions.
The CHOI host said he had not made any donations to help Haitians because it was not clear that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Panel believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension on this."
“My file has been blank for a year and a half,” the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will have to, among other things, announce these decisions once during peak viewing hours within three days.
The King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special background.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, since for those who don't like the ground game present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security guard and as a clerk for UPS just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing,” he said.
"Currently, I'm preparing to go to China for the San Shu World Cup."
“The fighters who finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category were invited.”
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I came third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
“What’s interesting is that I’ve progressed in every competition.”
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
“San shou” or “sanda” is a discipline originating in China where punches and kicks, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
The duels originally take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renowned pugilist resulting from this form of combat is the Vietnamese-born American Cung Le, well recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to remember only one event in his career, he will certainly answer his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung fu.
“This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China,” said the friendly gaillard.
“It’s kind of the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand).”
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real pro," he said.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium composed of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor obtained the largest, that of the management of the project, for a sum of $ 295 million without tendering.
This consortium called Energy Stewardship was formed in 2004 at the same time as Hydro-Québec chose to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for managing this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energy Stewardship consortium closed the lucrative contract without a public call for tenders.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing prices to rise.
“This is the new way to collude and knock down competition.”
"That is to say that people, instead of doing this in a secret way, now do it in an open way," PQ MP Sylvain Simard said yesterday at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said it was difficult to see how the public interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was collusion for this contract.
“I’m starting to have my trip,” she said, arguing that the PQ had been “dishonest” and had “lacked rigor.”
She said that "it would be the least thing" that the PQ apologized.
The formula of consortia is a common practice all over the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The project is ongoing and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition acting; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of consortia in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overview of Quebec’s business register makes it possible to count more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, brings us back to one and the same legal person, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Stewardship consortium, Minister Normandeau pointed out that "the James Bay territory responds to particular workforce dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to them in a particular way since the 1970s".
Eastmain project's big boss, Réal Laporte of the James Bay Energy Corporation (JBEC), gave an explanation that raised eyebrows over the fact that the project's management contract was awarded over-the-counter.
"If you go to tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory deal and with a good price."
“But the idea is that it’s not the price that matters, it’s the competence of the people,” Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Energy Stewardship consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, Genivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention its participation in Énergie gérance.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Energy Stewardship contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Quebec Liberal Party".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "finance" it, before specifying that it was rather its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
Quebec consumers have very little confidence in sustainable development players, but also in fair brands and green certifications to guide their choices.
Worse, even if he is immersed in a media universe where messages in favor of a more responsible consumption abound, he deplores a lack of credible information, a deficiency that he even describes as a brake on his commitment, says the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even if they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the companies' environmental commitment as well as the companies' green advertising, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatoire de la consommation responsable de l'Université Sherbrooke.
Another observation: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications affixed to so-called fair trade products, but also the credibility of products and brands displaying themselves as being eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, the discourse of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this part of consumption currently animated by nearly a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and questionable nature of the information would calm the ardour of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers are also suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services that they are trying to put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and especially changed the brand of one or more products to meet their conviction.
At 61%, they also favored purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and preferred the purchase of food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological awareness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers reported using public transit or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this large behavioral survey, which has just taken its first shot.
A government loan for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which has been asked to commit financially to the acquisition of the eXcentris film complex by the Angus and the Parallele, agrees to collaborate, but only on a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, who were hoping for a $7 million donation from the Ministère de la Culture to buy the eXcentris film complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard from Daniel Langlois, are not getting what they wanted.
The government agrees to get involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the Quebec government is proposing a loan that would be lower than the initial expectations, which could constitute a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of sources from state pharmacies.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the applications have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who is leading the eXcentris file.
He sent her a final report about 10 days ago.
But the cabinet’s counter-proposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems, however, that the state gift hypothesis really needs to be ruled out.
Recall that the Association des propriétaires de cinéma et de cinéparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministère de la Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
On the contrary, a number of people in the community were asking for substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of céans, has for ten years carried at arm's length the cinema of auteur in its premises of the complex after having financed itself its construction, which could justify a derogation on the part of the Treasury Board.
The lack of cinemas for independent films is glaring in Montreal, and eXcentris had managed to retain its clientele.
The Angus Company and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, continues to broadcast films to eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three theaters on February 27th by screening Xavier Beauvois's beautiful film Of Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals made to them.
The veil lifted on a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks shed light on what the U.S. sees as the inferiority complex of Canadians toward Americans, but at the same time betrays the latter’s sense of superiority toward Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canada-U.S. relations in mind when they go to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the Conservative government to pass its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out in the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to get under the teeth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the middle of the federal election campaign, tells how the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
Much to the astonishment of the U.S. Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
“An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may be conditioning Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues in everyday life rather than focusing this election on the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),” he wrote.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, “the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about it.”
The ambassador understands all the less this "deafening silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
“Logically, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this critical relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote.”
The other expression of this sense of importance can be read in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'Affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government in the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade because of a $30 to $40 billion stimulus plan,” Breese wrote.
There is no mention that the government had to prorogue Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that drama series broadcast on CBC refer to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the programs Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are unsubtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the CIA's kidnappings for tough interrogations.
Another cable reports that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he handed a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
“The secretary agreed to review the case.”
Finally, it should be noted that the WikiLeaks website is getting hotter.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered".
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
The UN proposed yesterday in Cancun a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries in order to achieve a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction that corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction that must be achieved to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in line with the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, the bulk of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHGs emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase overall GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract from this balance sheet another 5 Gt to stabilize by 2020 the rise of the climate to 2 degrees centigrade to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, produces light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy need is reduced by twice more.
Compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, like those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These brand new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about compact fluorescent bulbs because they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
But, says the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international program.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire waits in nervousness for election results announcement
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the publication “without delay” of the results of the presidential election in Côte d’Ivoire, after the deadline has expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
“It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.”
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission let the deadline of Wednesday midnight pass without publishing the results, three days after the election on Sunday.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CIS had said on television that the commission "continues to work" to announce the results.
The calls multiplied Wednesday in the world for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the Constitutional Council cancelling “fraudulent” votes in the north, held by the former rebel Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian president, said that the intimidation of voters practiced by the FN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are upheld by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo’s opponents believe that the country’s highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northerner who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, said the delay in announcing the results was "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that had been split in two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished at the top of the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the vote against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France according to the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in mainland France (9.7% including the overseas departments), show the seasonally adjusted data (CVS) provisional published Thursday by INSEE.
The number of unemployed stands at 2,631 million in metropolitan France.
Data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the working population in metropolitan France and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over the course of a year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage point.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people on the labour market has deteriorated further, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, to 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points over three months, + 0.5 points over one year) and 25% including the French overseas departments.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
Seniors, for their part, experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points over three months as well as over one year), or 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the French overseas departments.
Only 25-49 year-olds benefited from stable unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
INSEE has not published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a waste treatment company executive and brother of the PS president of the Bouches-du-Rhône general council, was indicted and jailed at the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been indicted for abuse of corporate property, embezzlement of funds and public property, concealment, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, and not fantasies."
“It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible charges, it is another thing to prove them,” Florence Rault, his lawyer, told AFP before the hearing of his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strongman of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has insisted, through his lawyers, to pass to the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also indicted on Wednesday evening and imprisoned.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but run the landfills he had to manage.
As for the awarding of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he never knew about it, said Mr. Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was indicted Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with prohibition to meet the protagonists of the file.
"My client was able to provide explanations for the facts he was accused of."
"The investigating judge took this into account by not depriving him of his freedom," said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been indicted and released overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them placed under judicial control, said the deputy prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager for cleanliness at Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "influence trading and passive corruption".
Two officials of the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are indicted for "subtraction and misappropriation of public property by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicity in misappropriation of public funds".
Finally, the companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was indicted for "receipt of abuse of corporate property".
Among the people who faced Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies were used to launder money from big banditry.
The investigation is being conducted in the context of several judicial investigations opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill of La Ciotat, which collects the waste of Aubagne as well as some cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss affair: the Elysée exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", held the opinion in suspense in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the undersides of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice for dealing with their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman had not been matched by the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the American justice for trafficking materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they cast a harsh light on how the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it was not.
A diplomatic cable written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is titled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases".
The Elysée’s advisor for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, meet with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own forcibly detained nationals to Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "always hammer" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate liberation."
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it all the more because the Iranians are asking you not to do it.”
Because, past the attempts of discussions through discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters in dilatory maneuvers".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail".
He announces that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day she takes refuge in the embassy of France) "will require the payment of a large sum of money" (230,000 euros deposit).
And he says the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains stranded in Iran.
An information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for an illegal traffic of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iran’s clandestine networks for acquiring material for the nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a bargain?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysee, he said, not only “was completely taken by surprise by the judge’s decision,” but sought to oppose it.
"There were lively exchanges between the French presidency and the guard of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot reverse the judicial decision," he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser dials a phone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée is sparing its efforts, through communiqués and "leaks" organized in the media, to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role as "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that the manipulation bears fruit since several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
On what basis is so much "gratitude" expressed towards Mr. Assad, wonders the embassy in Paris.
Despite their laudatory statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians actually did.
The document then looks at the reasons why the Elysee has poured into this fiction.
The intense communication effort “aimed at validating Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which “had then been perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and undeserved”.
By “exaggerating the Syrian role”, Paris seeks to “demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region”.
The aim is also to “sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran”.
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Francois Richier told him: “Of course, we don’t know if the Syrians did anything.”
“But we thanked them anyway.”
“It should at least cause confusion among Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received it at the Elysee Palace.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria, for their “active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot.”
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called “Cinderella” law that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, to young people under the age of 16, said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
“A lot of kids play these games all night and then have trouble studying at school and having a normal life during the day.”
“We believe this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep,” Jo Rin, the minister in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make available to people who want it free software that can limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to heavy use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA designates the host countries
In turmoil due to suspicions of corruption, FIFA’s executive committee on Thursday named the countries hosting the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying risk taking precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is for sure, the 2018 edition of the FIFA queen competition will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
That of 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its implantation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
The backstage negotiations are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh heavily on the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the source of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC delivered a layer on Monday, broadcasting a documentary that highlights three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to displease Fifa and embarrass the English officials, who have engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of government hopes to repeat the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 for London the organization of the Olympics-2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore the coat of arms of England to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spain-Portugal duo does not lack assets with its stadiums already ready, its expertise (World-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the two countries’ grim economic and financial prospects could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become an underdog despite the shortcomings of its file (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced an "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
“We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them,” Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strong from the experience of 1994, appear as the logical favorites.
As the world’s leading economic power, home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to be one step ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have separately built a very beautiful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organized the event in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, ardently desired by FIFA, which would effectively nullify the Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which has released the big game with futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of the TV rights paid (due to the time difference) by European countries, the nerve of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the obvious
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made it seem that he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One term at the Elysee calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious does not mix with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
We have to act as if doubt still exists.
One way or the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011".
That he evokes before UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday evening at the Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" has therefore sowed a little excitement.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were a long way off.
The president only recalled that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited the number of five-year-olds to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election, in a humorous tone, at such meetings.
“At worst, or at best, you have another seven and a half years with me,” he told them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His words the day before yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before; they make him no less a candidate.
If they get comments, it's for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it is not Ségolène Royal’s entry into the competition that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS are demanding an earlier order of battle than expected.
The bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
“We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this,” the prime minister’s entourage immediately and cautiously reacted.
“If he believes defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate,” Raffarin said.
"He will always believe he can win," said Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: ECB forced to keep buying government bonds
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the way out of the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of many of the unconventional monetary policy operations that are due to end at the end of the year.
As the European sovereign debt crisis requires, the Frankfurt Issuing Institute will probably not be able to afford to be so peremptory or risk aggravating a more than tense situation on European bond markets today.
The political cost would be all the higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde praised the active role played by the ECB in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she felt the central bank needed to do more, for example by increasing its program to buy sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...)".
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no more vocal about his intentions, simply stating that the program of buying government securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decide" at this Thursday's meeting.
The only certainty: the ECB will keep its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB’s purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week, to nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the eurosystem have bought for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the expectations of continued purchases (see page 29).
Economists are also not expecting any significant change in course.
While the ECB's longer-term lending operations have already disappeared from its arsenal, the ECB is still making unlimited allocations of liquidity on generous terms and for terms ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this arrangement to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine that she's making any significant changes to her program."
“Otherwise, it would be risky to provoke new tensions in the short term,” said Commerzbank economist Michael Schubert.
"A gradual exit announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," said Norbert Br?ms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these bonds to animate a sluggish market", adds Norbert Br?ms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
“It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a runaway return paid by the most fragile states,” said a major bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates soar, states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The protection of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government does the round back
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a little yesterday with the ebb in 10-year bond rates.
A return to precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and expect a weekend "unpredictable", which the interested party later denied.
On Tuesday, the gap with German long-term rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of hedging contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had skyrocketed to 263 points, resulting in some panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the gap with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "deeply concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the sluggishness of tax revenues that goes with it, making the state run the risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecast from Brussels has been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate is 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (against 3.9% expected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new collective budget that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
“If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken,” said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving support from international institutions.
“The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
“There is no immediate problem, either in the short term or in the long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, Ed.), the stabilization efforts required of Italy are less than those required of other countries,” said Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
There is still the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which early elections could be held at the end of March.
It would then open an unfavourable period for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde told a press conference in Paris yesterday: "The Europeans, I believe we demonstrated again Sunday in the day and at night, are obviously in solidarity, determined, committed to defend their currency and their monetary zone."
Although all relative, the détente recorded yesterday on the rates of European government bonds has brought water to the mill of the governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet speak of a beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt rating, the most targeted target today by speculation.
“As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs in particular on banking systems,” say the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
“Political time is much slower than market time.”
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it conceals, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are well underway.
This is also in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu is the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, started on Tuesday in Singapore an Asian tour to inform far-eastern investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the objective of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first issues of EFSF securities are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the U.S. would support a possible increase in funds raised through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries on the front lines, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in terms of labour market organisation.
Reforms that add to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path than Greece and Ireland.
Both sides are keen to avoid asking for international assistance before putting in place their own fiscal adjustments and deciding on the structural reforms that are essential to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of normalising sovereign bond markets.
While in Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, estimate that an extension of around 100 billion euros would be enough, “preferably” in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism with, to date, 60 billion euros.
A council that has every chance of being examined carefully in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsened.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in vigilance orange
Snow events still cause traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and risk disrupting certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienne, have been added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Layers of snow ranging from 2 to 5 cm, punctually from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
Snow events are notable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several départementals have been banned for heavy goods vehicles over 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend to take his vehicle only in case of necessity and the circulation of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to be very careful on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked the airlines to cancel Thursday 25% of their flights on the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly because of the coming snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the time that the debate around the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions have been raining down.
At least in the discussion.
In particular, we are talking about 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the State announced a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the SGP to borrow on the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Now we finally get to the first additions.
The Amending Finance Act 2010, examined in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
“The revenue from this tax is 117 million euros per year.”
The second is a redevelopment of an office tax that already exists "in order to modernize it, to increase the product and to allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that pay?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We are far from 4 billion.
“It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the 4 billion euros of the capital endowment that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses,” reads the statement of reasons.
At the SGP, we do not find this system shocking.
“From the moment we create revenue, we can cover the studies over three years and then type in the 4 billion after,” he said.
“It’s going to be in the budget and drawn down as you go along.”
The GSP estimates that the $4 billion will begin to be recorded in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised 4 billion are still absent subscribers, risks provoking a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public session on 7 December.
Vengeance Hackers and Diligence Spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal that only appears as a scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file constituted by a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those owned by Berlusconi), and Gaddafi's ominously cartoonish profile has long been for cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should only be composed of previously known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret service, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore devoted to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous books.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (or does not know where to look for news on the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only what they already know, and who reconfirm what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
I'm going for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of limited mind) the head of the secret services (otherwise he could be, what do I know, editor at Libération), who retains as true only what he recognizes.
The top secret Berlusconi information that the U.S. Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same information that Newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of state can call each other or take a plane to meet at dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises of representation, have turned into centers of espionage.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only through hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put U.S. diplomacy in the wrong light.
Second, the idea that any hacker could capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
So the scandal does not put the victims so much in crisis as the “harbours”.
But let’s get to the deep nature of what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell's time, one could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely fulfilled since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway taken, and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when we demonstrate, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – elected as the citizen’s avenger – can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that knowing everything about Berlusconi’s or Merkel’s character is indeed an empty secret, because it is in the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets means taking away all power from her.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but has done too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to post any reserved information online - that would be like publishing it on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is futile to hope to be able to maintain confidential reports by phone.
There is nothing easier than finding out if and when a head of state flew in and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relationships be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my forecast is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am forced to imagine government agents who move discreetly in stagecoaches with uncontrollable routes, being carriers only of messages learned by heart or, at the most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing in crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has reestablished a wire telegraph (telephone).
The videocassettes (analog) had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going forward and backward and discovering all the secrets of the editing, while now the CDs (digital) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, that is to say by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, you get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the trips it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that the politics and the techniques of communication turn to horse-drawn cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was going on in the secret of embassies.
Now it is the embassies that are asking the press for confidential information.
Climate: how France is making promises of funding
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it’s time to look at how fast-start or early-stage funding promises made by developed countries are being met.
And the big French hacks are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (or 420 million a year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU released the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: report detailing the action of its member states, press conference, big side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is appreciated and appreciated: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had provided 2.2 billion euros in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of 7.2 billion euros in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of Official Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has considered 2009 as a reference year: international funding is maintained, and it adds $150 million over three years for fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
In contrast, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 are "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to spending in previous years or to the overall level of Official Development Assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of France’s support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to “new and additional” financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses his mode of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that a loan is equivalent to a given loan.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to emission mitigation that rely on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that we will recover as equivalent to one euro that we give ... At the most, should only be counted as part of its commitments the cost of the loan for the lending country (equivalent to an interest rate).
But France has nothing to do with such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only EU country to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union spends 1 euro to meet its commitment, France spends only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice sleight of hand!
In summary, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only 36.1 million euros, it manages to make believe that it spends 420 million "new and additional" consistent with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why the other Member States would continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The early finance chapter is only a small, relatively short-term issue compared to the overall climate discussion.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Hopefully this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting method for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could push forward discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently being discussed): the question of "additionality" or how to account for loans will not be overlooked.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore that the new Minister of the Environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast start and its vision of “additionality” and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (former Movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought between July and September the foods generally consumed in four meals and a snack in a day by a child of about ten years, in supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These typical meals, including official recommendations – five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day – as well as treats, were examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The assessment of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five as certain carcinogens as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EDs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
“Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each individual chemical are not exceeded, our investigation shows that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is of concern,” the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven as certain carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack by the study, has traces of six chemicals including a fungicide yet banned in France.
The same goes for Kenya’s green beans, included in the lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the minced steak, canned tuna, and even the baguette of bread and chewing gum were loaded with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of this "contaminant cocktail" "is probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "face to the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase of diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
