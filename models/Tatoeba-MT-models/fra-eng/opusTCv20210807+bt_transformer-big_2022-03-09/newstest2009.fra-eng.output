At the end of the trade, the Prague stock exchange turned negative.
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague stock exchange rectified its losses.
Trades with the shares reached almost half of the usual daily trades.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the trade, the Prague stock exchange resumed its fall from the previous day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the plan for the stabilization of the US financial sector, is also noticeable in our country.
Stocks fall in Asia
The Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even though the indices managed, during the day, to erase some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Hang Seng Index lost four percent during trading, but later it wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index following the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent as markets closed in Shanghai.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five per cent, but in the end the losses were reduced to 4.3 per cent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"Hesitation about bailout action in the US will affect financial markets around the world," said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's monetary office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it sets its monetary policy itself, that is, independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are the same as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US lawmakers should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will be affected.
The Bloodbath of U.S. Stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, to which it should have devoted up to $700 billion (nearly 12 billion pounds).
In this way, lawmakers reject the call for support for President George Bush’s project.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath and the major stock indices experienced the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index lost nearly seven per cent, having fallen so far for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress Ceded: US Government Can Inject $700 Billion Into Banks
The leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of the financial aid agreement for the US financial system.
It will be put to a vote early next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a turning point in talks about adopting a bailout in the form of $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner) in financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
Success, however, is not certain.
Indeed, before they can publish the final version of the law and put it to the vote, the Congressmans must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Regulation Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor to revive financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market support can be effective, a "disillusionment" will follow.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
We have settled our differing views on what the market stabilization package should look like,” Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be taken as early as Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of lawmakers met with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, in order to give the bottom of the government a final shape.
It is expected to buy from financial firms the unsaleable real estate assets that drive financial firms into considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
“We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We still need to pursue this plan to restore markets, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis is having a significant impact on falling equity markets.
According to the Democratic senator, Harry Reid, lawmakers are making sure Congress reaches a final agreement as early as Sunday.
They want to calm investors before the start of trades in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the decision of Congress could influence Monday’s trades.
However, for the moment, it is impossible to say with certainty when the two houses of the US Congress will proceed to the vote, nor if the negotiations are not likely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by this or that problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be adopted in the coming days.
Nevertheless, the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount earmarked for the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But, if Congress will feel that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the option to block the granting of the remaining amount, following two steps: first $100 billion more, then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed the progress in the negotiations
Although the president can veto this decision, Congress has the opportunity to put him in the minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finances for the redemption of bad real estate securities, whose value declined, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
“All the work is done.
The House of Representatives is expected to be able to pass the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
Spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chair Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, says lawmakers have agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors from losses, the relief agreement, the unfolding of the plan on the axis of time.
The new law also provides for limiting the said golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establishes a committee, which will oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on the issue and have made significant progress toward a deal that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for property owners, who have problems to pay.
The government should negotiate new installments in the case of mortgages that it will buy back, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation is going to be very difficult.
“And this is due to the fact that we don’t know what the mechanism and the price of buying back problem assets will be.
This point will be decisive in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government,” Marek said this week at the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, is, according to Marek, not that important.
“It is much more important that the congressmen agree, as early as this week, that they support this plan and that they will dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at this time,” Marek stressed.
A fight pushed to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you, how to choose
While virtually every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
However, there are enough reasons to get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house an expensive high-end gramophone to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl record, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason, for this to happen.
However, if there are vinyl records in your shelves, packed with art rock, jazz or blues, you at least probably dream of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music while on the move, i.e. compressed music, to put it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, the same way a Pink Floyd fan would struggle to support headphones bought for twenty crowns at the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are functions unknown, of course, to most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephone calls and sending SMS, it is able to read music and movies, record them, it has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if we take into account smartphones and communicators, you will have in your pocket a small computer.
Since no fridge knows how to grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are practically witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal nature of the mobile is not without its drawbacks.
The larger the number of functions you use, the shorter the interval between reloads.
And playing music is one of the most important energy gutters.
Rare are mobiles that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this respect, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more efficient.
In the case of cheap mobiles, expect them to only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you happen to call from time to time, get yourself, to be sure, a second recharge for work - this being valid even for more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, which are capable, as a result of a reload, of a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
You can, of course, record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in mobiles.
As for the players, you do not need, except for the iPod, any software.
Simply fill, through the USB connector, the device with music from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create a media library themselves, classified according to the name of the performer, the title of the album, the style, or according to the judgment of the user.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, like Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (irriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
When choosing a concrete device, focus on the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if during the day you will listen to it only for a limited time, for example when taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading MP3.
Virtually all mobiles are capable of this today.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to play.
All are able to play MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have this format.
It is one of the most popular formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices manage to play WMA format music as well.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods), meanwhile, is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Just visit, from the mobile phone, the web pages of the operator (or those of another provider) and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to purchase a music mobile.
The offer of the operators is unfortunately miserable and it is limited, in most cases, to radio tubes quickly made.
The prices are also not the lowest.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether by GSM, internet, or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile phone with them.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to take the mobile out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in speakers, which almost all mobiles have, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of mobile music is its price.
The cheaper ones usually cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, one can have an already very suitable walkman.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best equipped, also equipped with an input for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Really anyone manages to ensure the order of the most rudimentary readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the control to that of a cassette set, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile internet plugged in by chance, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an exchangeable memory card slot (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models in principle only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones do it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, choose specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how the ease of control comes close to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as separately sold MP3 players, is the one that has gone the furthest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a longer battery life (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned, on Mobil.cz, the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The Czech Telecommunications Office, which has reported that the price of an SMS is higher at home than in the rest of the Union, has confirmed this.
Thus, following the European Commission's latest steps in the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvouk, the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (T.O.), who has stated on several occasions that in the Czech Republic there is no longer room for another operator, made chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with his own network is apparently not very lucky anymore (by the way, now, he would hardly find frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a considerable fall in prices, to which conventional operators must subsequently react.
However, even before the arrival of troublemakers such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those we hear today were heard in Great Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator has managed to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let’s add that behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which owns among others the U:fon in Czechia.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be efficient, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
This is how virtual operators around the world present themselves as low-cost operators – they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in Great Britain at least half as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity stunt.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
“Real men choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is hard to say, if such a concept would be likely to work in our home as well.
Vodafone’s spokesman Miroslav Cepicko said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very conducive.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area,” said Jana Studnikov, spokesman for the financial group Penta, in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were in any case not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible so that a potential competitor can not appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of corporate customers, does not hide, for quite a long time, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
“We are very keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already negotiated this possibility several times with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we managed to move forward in the negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl, a spokesman for the group.
Perhaps the future is promising.
From unofficial information, it looks like we might be able to host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
“At the moment, we do not believe there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific.
For the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this field has contacted us,” mentioned Vlastimil Sr. of Telefonika O2’s press department, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrovo said in a rare deal with the O2 statement: “We have not recorded a viable and bilaterally advantageous project at this time, which could serve as a basis.”
“It is virtually impossible for a virtual operator to appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited period of time, we should have a concrete agreement now.”
Vodafone instead focuses its attention on fulfilling requests to get its own 3G license.
Miroslav says of this: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the field of shared fees and infrastructure.
This is what we believe means the most value from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to set up a common network for a fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities: in tune with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and therefore to a decrease in their profit.
So what is the point of facilitating the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to get along like thieves in fairs. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also testifies to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on the T, when the U:fon was created, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the T’s web pages.
However, today, the U:fon lends itself as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrovo commented: "Competition in the mobile market has been further amplified recently by the entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject him, and especially his services, to high demands.
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
However, it is not only the attitude of the T, which, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power in the Czech Republic to intervene in economic competition.
This is the exclusive responsibility of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (OHS).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question concerning the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at this time, because the offer of potential interested parties has not previously shown sufficient interest for conventional operators," said Kristion Chalupa of the OHS Department of External Relations in response to our question.
A statement made in this way would not surprise the representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and among other things also take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
Even more so when Kristin Chalupa adds: "Foreign countries, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a decline in the prices of mobile telephone services."
However, lobbying for honest market operation and lower prices is apparently not in the interests of the OHS.
What is indeed shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, naturally arises.
In the same way, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to chance and the hard fight of the competition.
"The Office has not identified any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, and therefore none has an increased corresponding responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even from the telecoms regulator,” Chaloupa said in a statement.
One of the many points of contention is the interpretation of the dominant position in the market.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the T, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different view: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, it is necessary to obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without accepting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the OHS that three mobile operators are visibly proceeding in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Putting responsibility back on the T is a fairly common trick in communications, by means of which the OHS washes its hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted Telecommunications Act has not been successfully updated to include a broadening of the Telecommunications Competition Authority's powers in the area of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts have promised to improve the situation.
This is well known to the representatives of the OHS, but apparently their interests lie elsewhere.
When no one is watching, it can work.
That said, the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services, but these are only partly public.
In most cases, it is about companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
Specific mobile telephone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually reach only elected officials.
The magic trick consists in the fact that the company does in front of the operator figure of a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
“If what you’re talking about happens, it could be a breach of the contractual terms that we’d look at and that could lead to a halt to the collaboration with the company in question,” Kemrov said.
Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity has not reached the heads of mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
However, an operator does not rule against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them significant benefits, and at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Zepicko points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators.
This is precisely what should seem strange to the T.
In addition, there is another question for the OHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the OHS has relatively broad powers to be able to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a considerable drop in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators tried, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were virtually the same - a market too small, or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
It was precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies in developed countries intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators but those of their customers.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they ended up getting the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators treat this issue like a hot potato that gets rid of by passing it on to a nearby target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that the confusion in skills is more than profitable for them in these cases.
But don't throw the stick after the axe.
If the behind-the-scenes information is telling the truth and a virtual operator will appear soon, the Czech mobile market may be on the move again.
If one of the operators has agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the OHS to remain impassive in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolnek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov maj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jio Bolohlvek.
We have four versions - with male or female solo singing, a choir performance and an instrumental version.
The vocals are performed by Katesina Knannikova and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Kriek are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
The Czech national song is considered one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to the Czech public radio station, he chose to perform solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that the two singers, as well as the choir, had a good diction, so that we understand the words, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
Next year, the Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary.
The song Kde domov muj first resounded in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovaska (Kermesse des Savetiers), an original Czech play by Josef Kajeton Tyl, accompanied by the music of Franti?ek ?kroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse naturally became part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "New" Anthem Sounds
Public transport (MHD) Prague will introduce, Wednesday, the chip in their ticketing system
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Agency as the date on which the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible for about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a voucher for 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both have it registered on their smart card at the information points and offices of the Dopravna Podnik (Transport Agency), located at the Muzeum, M?stek, N?dra? Hole?ovice, And?l, Roztyly, Let?
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy the coupons by internet on the web pages of the Dopravna podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can permanently forget about the ticket counters in the metro stations, where they had until now to tread with impatience in long queues in order to get paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon via the internet and it will be registered on their Opencard in one of the thirteen M?stsk? knihovna (municipal libraries).
“In these points of contact, there is a ticket office available to passengers with trained staff, who will help the interested parties with the purchase via the internet and, in addition, will record the coupon they have purchased on their card,” said project spokesman Martin Opatrna.
Next to the libraries, it will also be possible to save the electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminiscent of the ticket-composting machines and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budsjovick, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk.
“Today the city has five, but by the end of the year there should be eighty,” added Opatrna.
An automaton will check the coupon instead of the driver
The automatons that will work from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Simply introduce the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also around the city.
Namely in the suburban trains and the bus lines 300 to 499, which mainly use the inhabitants of the communes of the Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the trains integrated in Prague integrated doprava (integrated transports of Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of the tickets Filip Drapal of the organization Ropid, which designs the schedules of the public transport Prague.
Peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver’s cash register.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard in the place indicated on the side of the cash register.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to check the validity of the checked coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Drapal added.
Passengers who do not take the suburban buses and will not remember the date when their coupon expires, can again join the vending machines, initially used to register the coupons on the card.
This is where information about the validity of their document will appear on the device screen.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum in the United States.
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans demanded that the city be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jiho-esk-v-deck-knihovna (The Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This stems, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jiho-esk-v-deck-knihovna.
In a letter to the US president, some Germans from the Czech Republic urged the US president not to allow "Cumavsk" (region of forests south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that the American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter, signed by “People, to whom the fate of the Umava is close to heart,” reads.
Given that the rallying to Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only brutality, attitude without regard, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take in his hands the protectorate of the Umava for now and forever.
“We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a state foreign to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and which has in no way contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into consideration the opinion of the quarter of a million inhabitants,” the letter reads.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the “Czech oppressors’ desire for revenge.”
If the president of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat naïve, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans had at least to foresee that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would obtain for the Sudetenland a certain type of autonomy.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The well-known Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who was born in the town of Budajovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German of Seké Budsjovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the English and placed in the capture camp of the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
“They believed that once they got home, Czech would be good for them,” says Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed, according to him, that, as a result of the Benea Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way of characterizing the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of the minister Ale?eb?ek believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behavior.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, film, the internet and on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and from drinking while driving.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, it wants to touch the consciousness of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also reflected in the “bloody” slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is capitalized on the license plate.
Then, in a puddle of blood, there’s the phrase “You’ll pay.”
This must symbolize that one can pay with life a moment of inattention.
The spots will "haunt" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of accident victims can be commonly seen.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG.
The strategy of sugar and whip against drivers
“What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by the fact of saving time, when they grill a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks,” says Martin Koon, the transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, believes the psychologist.
Signs warning drivers of danger are already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns of a hazard is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will not notice it," Koon reported.
Olmert would return in return for peace almost all the occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the president of Israel’s provisional government, ruled in favor of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made the statement in an interview published Monday by the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.
“We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all,” Olmert said.
“We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), since otherwise peace will not be achieved,” he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
“He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not desire tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem,” Olmert noted, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" located inside the Old City.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he said later.
Retiring from the Golan Heights
Olmert also supported Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was an indispensable condition for a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
“I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a Golan retreat,” he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollah (Shia movement); they will have to give up the constant support they give to the terrorism of Hamas (Shia movement), Al-Kaida (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are stewards in the bus illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long-distance bus is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the coach of the company Student Agency near Padua, Italy, arises the question if stewards and passengers can move during the journey inside the coach.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the transport ministry.
The accident in question, in which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck who crossed the path of the bus.
The girl was at that time unfortunately sitting next to the driver, in the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she has two other seats at her disposal.
However, the coach can have an accident, or even brake abruptly, also when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is under its data sheet equipped with standing seats or not.
If this standing equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The Student Agency long-distance coaches do not have standing seats; this was confirmed at Aktul.cz by the director of the company Radim Janura.
“This is an issue that we have dealt with with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they cancelled it and we got the passengers to go to the toilet during the ride provided they have their own seat,” he said.
The law ignores the steward.
"There is no one-sided legal interpretation of the steward role - no legal prescription deals with that role.
On the other hand, there are no legal prescriptions prohibiting the carrier from offering services.
The law on road transport knows only the term vehicle catcher; it does not define its rights and duties," Hanzelka added.
Josef Pokorna, the director of the Department of Road Traffic, believes, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently addresses the problem.
"It all depends on whether the bus has permission to offer standing seats in its homologation.
It’s all in there,” he said.
Coaches are divided into urban, where there are standing places and a limited maximum speed, interurban with standing places and a higher authorized speed and long distance coaches without standing place with the highest authorized maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Just like on the plane, an expert says.
Jaroslav Hoon, an expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) in transport safety, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft.
There, too, he is not sure when turbulence will occur and the air hostess can bump into her head.”
Now, in the event that the coach had braked abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or in a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards through internal requirements," he said, and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Janaura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only coach carrier to offer the services of stewards.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their profession as a risky profession.
"Nevertheless, as soon as I get the impression that this is a risky job, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper at boarding.
It would also reduce costs,” he said.
The safety concern is the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles by the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, which ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have any hostesses. We've been against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident,” he said, a year ago, at T-den.cz.
A huge tragedy has happened.
A young hostess from the Plzeo region, who had been working for the company for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop strip without using a flashing light and it blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter trying to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he brushed it by his right side.
The two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards were sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company plans to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the family of the girl, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but as for the financial compensation, it also relies on the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been in the process of being drafted for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarification on the trips of the stewards on board the coach.
"However, it has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone behind the wheel," says the expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," Hanzelka concluded, adding that the control of bus safety is under the power of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Dusseldorfers rest on Frankfurt.
The big words were not lacking in the letter sent by the WestLB steering committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the entities of the financial institute of Dusseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the financial group of Sparkasse" could be constituted, according to the mail made public Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "competence block" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive starting point for further mergers in the banking sector in the Land.
This is what it looks like when an executive committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, injured, is still under strong pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority that has, only recently, made it clear to the government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is running out in the search for a future solution.
However, for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side - there has been talk of a relationship of some kind between Deka Bank, which knows Sparkasse's clients through their investment funds, and WestLB.
Certainly the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas has indicated during the presentation of the figures of the semester at the end of August that he does not see any meaning in the merger of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, be it the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported by the banks of the Land and by the groups of savings banks, has instructed the Steering Committee to conduct talks with the WestLB for joint business activities.
It could then be the debit of the financial market, or parts of it.
However, the talks have only just begun, it is said in the financial center.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, counts as one of the largest employers in the Frankfurt financial center, comes into play when it comes to the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a while that Deta-Bank could merge with the Land Bank of Rhineland Palatinate and Halbab.
Nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
No sooner had the plans been made public than the government of the Land of Hesse pronounced itself against any participation of the Hellaba in them.
After that, the other two houses didn’t join either.
The Land Bank of Rhineland-Palatinate was instead attached to the Land Bank of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the merger of Deka-Bank with banks in the Land.
Finally, however, Hellaba’s Chairman of the Board, Gunther Merl, opposed any commercial strategy to merge with his bank.
Apart from this, there seems to be a growing sense that the consolidation of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a union of the BayernLB with the Baden-Wuttenberg State Bank could come to fruition first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure on new mergers were to increase, potential partners would gradually slip away.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has so far resisted the crisis better than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringia savings and transfers group, which owns 85 per cent of Helaba's capital, did, however, lock down any union with WestLB at the beginning of the year.
The NordLB would remain.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one facet.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question of which business model should ensure the future capacity of the banks in the Land had not yet been resolved by the German grouping of savings banks and credit transfers.
Eventually, a WestLb cutting could take place, cutting which here is obviously not desired.
This is also what is referred to in the letter of the existing Executive Committee: in any case, a "comprehensive solution" would be sought for the institution.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, nearly a five-liter barrel of Kaiser brand beer, stands a well-built bearded man who shows about 200 beer festival visitors what deep sounds his throat can produce.
Elena first taps Luca, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the Puorta nueva station, four buses start this evening at 23:45, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival scheduled at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travel exclusively from Brazil.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are singing gold and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with faux fur and glasses with large silver frames.
For the past five years, they have been going to the beer festival, already three trips this year alone.
They go at night, stay the day at the party, and come home at 10:30 p.m.
Spending the night there would involve unnecessary expenses, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome drink with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with Bavarian purity law, health insurance and an official of the German speaking group - Marco did a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses run in the night on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There is no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet on the bus, travelers sleep.
It's better that way, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian license plates are once again taking a break shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When Marco's group finally arrives at 6:30 a.m. as planned in the parking lot near Place Thérèse, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, wear a small yellow cap.
Above it is written on the left "Beer Festival" in Gothic, and next to it the internet address of Marco's travel agency "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: “When the doors of the beer tent open, we run,” Marco shouts in the early morning.
'Run!' Run and reserve seats at the bottom of the tent.
“Not in front, or else we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, we have to spread them out in the room!”
The mug, Marco shouts, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the instructions!
Show the security guards that we are behaving well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they’re gone!”
Third: "Tonight, to be back here at ten and a half o'clock."
And there it is, it's off to the beer party.
On the way, someone ties yellow caps to trees to find the way, signs and even an election poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the Italians’ weekend.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 who set out across the Alps and collapse in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would have come expressly from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross which produces a statistic on the countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the Hofbruu brewery tent.
Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate Shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisted the Federal Minister of Finance just a few weeks ago.
How lucky that the politician used the word "relatively" and slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared from the crisis movements.
This one actually happened this weekend.
Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), on the side of the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to protect itself from the turbulence of the markets.
A person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that the aid credits are issued up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate would now have to pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes as much from private banks as from public law banks.
In the background, it is the daughter company Depfa that bears the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced himself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since because of distrust towards the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, while the equity rate had also declined slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Current and net profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period the previous year, zero, profits from the allocation of specified receivables and securities as well as the termination of provisions in credit transactions had fallen by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
And it was only thanks to the large profits from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as from the repayment of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern's companies that the shortfall in earnings of about 16 percent turned out to be moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier had initially speculated badly on industrial real estate loans, which had then been filialized to the bank Aareal.
Because conventional state financing was not profitable enough, Depfa was then more intensely involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the daughter company, the Hypo Real Estate must make depreciations which should have on the calculation of the gains and losses of the group an essential material effect which remains nevertheless rather vague.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had been cut to two-thirds.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing on the interbank market since it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks has again dried up considerably, as banks have accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - about 50 billion euros - of all the credits of the Depfa of a medium short-term refinancing.
According to a statement from the Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing need is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of the international financial markets largely out of working condition at the moment.
Other sources say the refinancing would be secured through the funds until the end of 2009.
HRE Executive Chairman Georg Funke said the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer have to resort to financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for the Supervision of Financial Services (Bafin) assume that the Hypo Real Group's capacity in the market is now assured.
The bank’s shareholders and creditors can only hope so.
However, given the dynamics and unaccountability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used to its full extent.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the bank is, according to the latest statements, still on the verge of insolvency late Sunday evening, this temporary rescue will not succeed in reassuring minds either.
The share price fell from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are doing particularly well.
While debts in the first place have barely moved, the prices of second-rate loans are declining.
The most affected are, of course, the investment funds of the former daughter-company W rttemberg Hypo and those that have a lifespan beyond 2009.
The bonds of Hypo Real Estate Bank previously seemed to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the very institute that brought the crisis into the institution by the acquisition of the bank Depfa.
As long as the issuing institutions, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that the arrears will be resolved over time.
Or what no one dares hope will happen right now – that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that approached security has now become a mere well-founded hope.
This should reserve sleepless nights above all for long-term creditors on whether they should part with their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they have drawn a line on to build a carry-over of losses for the next few years on the next capital income tax of stock gains automatically levied.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, has to show up for the first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start laughing: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
What was I excited about?
The road to school scared me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the 40-minute train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I did not get lost.
The beginning of classes does not seem to be set as strictly as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students appear one after the other from eight o'clock, until at nine o'clock minus twenty, a round table begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I don’t like to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I did not yet have the school uniform, I put on an old skirt from my foster mother, as well as a shirt, blue high socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I showed up in front of the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all performed low masses, laughed and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him because of my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of Japanese teens and means "cute, cabbage".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me gave me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the time was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was assailed in the rules.
Everyone talked to who better, laughed and asked me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all took out their Bento.
My foster mother had also made me this kind of lunchbox - it's really something else than the miserable German snacks.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, little sausages, a cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I’m eating here in Japan.
Things have a weird appearance and a completely new taste.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe candied salted plums, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of being able to make the boy's acquaintance a little better during the break.
I read this in my manga.
I’m curious to know if I could watch it here as well.
“Why Japan in particular?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always answered:
"Because it fascinates me, what?"
In the end, reading manga has been my favorite thing for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and the culture that is there, at one point I also started to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, habits and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have feelings.
A rat or cockroach flees from danger, does that mean that it also feels fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having until now been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and approach the questions of feeling or in general of consciousness, we enter difficult terrains because the Hardware does not correspond.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, flees, or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our subjective experience to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral Cortex (due to its participation in short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
At the very least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, including the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to foresee and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differs even from other primates.
Another significant feature could lie in the linguistic nature of Man: a large part of his existence being related to language, this often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not dependent on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, is neither measured nor, because of this particular Hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses us with big problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without considering their content, and this is exactly what happened in studies of the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, we focus more on the nerve correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: the two can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal Cortex in the realization of the visualization.
But what does this mean for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we refer to as “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its sequels, such as the reactions of the body) takes up living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our voluble nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impute them to others than to ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities are born in the regions of the corporeal sensation of the Cortex and the brainstem, just like Jaak Pankseep, who however focuses more on the brainstem.
As this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could quite participate in transverse sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it to be unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in both humans and rats is likely to be felt as such in both cases: how can we check if rats and humans feel the same way when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach flees from danger, but if he feels fear?
In my opinion, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Admittedly, nerve comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain trunks, cockroaches on the other hand do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem the cause of the sensations?
And even if we could prove this for humans: how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness relies on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In all cases, progress is being made on the nervous level, as rats and humans are measuring the same.
As I do not explore the language and consciousness in rats, nor the sensations, I do not know if they exist.
You might think it’s short-term, but I’d rather move forward than constantly banging myself against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotional.
UEFA President Platini: Poland and Ukraine graced
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and in its ability to organise, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the schedule of the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
We have to work at maximum speed,” said Ukrainian League President Grigorij Surkis.
“UEFA is constantly watching us.
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The management of the Polish football league PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by independent director Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
“There is a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act properly,” said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured in a letter to the UEFA President that preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer."
Several members of the Premier League have already been convicted in the previous season for mandatory relegation manipulation; in the end, the start of the League even had to be delayed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignant counterattack
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about her private life in an interview - and is now in trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on her ex-adulterine Dennis Quaid.
It scums - and counterattacks.
A belated Roses war for ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in an unsightly battle – in plain sight.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the marriage failure: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have become aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The motive for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - there is told the story of an adulterer.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his qualification as an unfaithful husband was clear: it would be “monstrous,” he told the 54-year-old New York Daily News, “that Meg would once again mess up the history of our relationship and manipulate it.”
It would be even more "regrettable" if "the pain and turmoil of divorce for each child were to be revived in public again" for their 16-year-old son Jack.
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
Thus was his reply to the claw: "In any case, my life goes on.
I feel happy to have a wonderful family that is doing its best.”
Prices of airline tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would have become advantageous again – this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and, after a price increase in the first quarter, established a sharp decline in profits in the second quarter.
After prices in the hotel market have been rising for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities examined by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the low dollar price that has led to a “desire for downbound travel by American tourists.”
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices stand at 26.3 percent, the highest in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was upward in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, economy-class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, which consume a lot of fuel, even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, economy-class ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, in business class and first class, however, the price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights were even halved according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would be on the one hand a weakening economic growth, explains the firm.
Demand would give way in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure from the Open Skies Treaty, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the removal by the airlines of the non-profitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first in the standings.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not managed to find a functional eleven.
From Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach’s player only got into the game late and his shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips in a persuasive way.
He just knew he was right.
“We need that second goal,” Hermann Rieger whistled in the dressing room of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn’t much going on in the locker room, the half-time was over and most had sat down in their place.
Rieger was for nearly three decades the physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that is why his request was received at the strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
The implementation has failed.
"It wasn't all very nice to see today," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhard would have "wanted to be more relaxed too".
This 1:0 (1:0 at halftime), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful head strike by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not hurt the weak Hamburg players.
“It was a dirty victory,” said Marin Jol.
The SV Hamburg will celebrate its 121th anniversary on Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, the fans were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as first in the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to step back,” said Marcell Jansen.
He doubts that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the first League than the domination of his HSV.
The team with its late-comers - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen debauched from FC Bayern - is certainly forming slowly, but it does not shine yet.
“We need more charm and more dribbling,” Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
On Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the failure of the bailout caused the Dow Jones to temporarily drop 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the span of a day in history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a bit.
Around 8:30 p.m., the largest stock market index in the world was 10,579 points with a drop of well five percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange Index was at 1,548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The Dow’s biggest losers were American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent, and the Bank of America, which lost about 12 percent.
No title could earn any more profits.
The shares of Goldman Sachs Bank fell by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, resources must be mobilized for the purchase of what are called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the amount should not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged in line with the evolution of the price in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
Stock prices sucked into the whirlwind in Europe and the United States
Billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not address investor concerns.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones Index is collapsing despite the government’s planned financial market bailout.
Spectacular declines in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The Bavarian real estate financier’s stock lost three-quarters of its value at times despite the rescue operation by the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank saw a decline of more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped well below the important 6,000-point psychological bar and was sided with 5,839 points with a 3.7 percent deficit.
Stock markets around the world have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors were concerned that the US government’s hefty $700 billion bailout might not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost in the opening hour 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout, with the Senate vote expected to follow Oct. 1.
The other European stock exchanges have also seen only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index has fallen for the moment by 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s main Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after an initial rise of 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12.595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The multinational commercial and tourism company has also announced that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers perplexed: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the "Ulysses" space probe has been flying in space.
Due to soon-frozen fuel conductions, cryogenic death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing disarray among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver of space probes, by which they obtain an additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, the Earth for example.
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
This has been surprising researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable laws of gravitation.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The probes unexpectedly become faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They named it the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still believes hard as iron that Einstein was not wrong and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
“Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to Earth,” he writes.
Space researchers have only known about dark matter for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from her a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Abducted tourists in Egypt are free
After ten days at the hands of their captors, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-liberation shootout, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
The Germans are constantly in the crosshairs of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arabic TV channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are in the process of checking their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian woman as well as their eight Egyptian companions are doing well and are safe, announced the Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
Circumstances surrounding a shooting before the hostages were released are still unclear: for example, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without warning.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom,” the agent said.
All that remained was to collect the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers shot dead six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers demanded a ransom from Germany in the amount of six million euros; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" said that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men had to be held until the kidnappers found a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on the story.
Abuse of a father-in-law who led to suicide
A court has been told that years of abuse inflicted by her father-in-law led to a woman committing suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent assault.
The Truro High Court has ruled that he regularly bound his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, during her childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter: “I feel responsible for his death.”
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child while living in Coventry, Trerise tied and bandaged her before forcing her to perform sexual acts, while her mother worked at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, an avid volunteer at National Trust, was haunted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends said Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had been “emotionally dead” since 2006 and “lost all hope for life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she committed suicide by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the father-in-law of his daughter, who had also written a letter of confession which ended thus: "I tied and bandaged her regularly."
“I didn’t sexually abuse her.
“I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You’re really weird as a fetishist, your victim must certainly have been terrorized, especially at the age of 7.
“This unpleasant saga ended with the suicide of the victim.
And what’s even more amazing is the fact that if she hadn’t done that, her story would certainly never be finished in court.”
He added: "I am particularly stressing, as his father and mother describe it, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, successful young woman today."
Conviction for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office ministerial officer who had forgotten top secret documents in June on a train will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The Department of Defense man was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train bound for Waterloo.
The documents were passed into the hands of the BBC before being delivered to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said this episode had a lot of people from Whitehall.
"They will have thought that this case would have remained within the walls of the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed, is accused of violating section 8.1 of the act, that is to say the clause that deals with the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the highly sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Committee of Secret Services.
The documents he lost contained assessments of Al-Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Building companies facing the bill B&B.
British construction companies may have to pay a bill of more than $80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided $14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savers.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from savers, including 59 building companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) CEO Adrian Coles said it’s “irritating” to know that companies and their members will have to pay for the broken pots.
The $14 billion loan will be repaid when the Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But the interest that will increase at the same time, will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that all 59 building companies are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that institutions that have behaved prudently... now have to pay some of the institutions’ bills that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay an amount proportional to the deposits it holds, and that intermediary companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will rise in 2009 to EUR 450 million.
This means that companies will have to find $81 million to settle the first year’s interest.
Adrian Coles, chief executive of the building companies’ trade committee, told the BBC that the decision seemed unfair to him.
It’s “irritating” to see that institutions that have behaved cautiously when the real estate market picks up, now have to pay for much less cautious institutions.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals.
“We need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to evaluate options to avoid building companies and their members paying that hefty bill,” Cole said.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, we will have to pay the interest for the entire year, which could double.
Since building companies are shareholderless organizations, their member end up paying the bill either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five penny per liter
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk, by five penny per liter, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase following a two-penny increase in February, and follows a search by a consulting firm.
Retail sellers must decide if they, in turn, will increase the price to consumers.
. Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was last varied in 2002.
Former Bangladeshi PM denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has denied a bail application to former PM Sheikh Hasina, who is at risk of being arrested upon his return to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail because of her indictment for extorting 50 million Taka ($729.000.00) from a businessman when she was PM.
This case is one of many charges brought against him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina’s lifelong rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but his party, the League Awani, has demanded that the country’s provisional military government first give him his full freedom.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
“The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s request that she not require bail as she had been allowed to go abroad on medical grounds,” said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
“We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court.”
Her lawyers argued that she needed the bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after Oct. 17, a former Awami party leader said.
She was detained last year after the military interim government assumed power, but was released in June for treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, deny the accusations against them.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
Last week, the UN carried out a vaccination campaign in all six provinces.
But she says she is unable to contact children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A UN spokesman said this happened despite promises by the Taliban not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV court battle
BSkyB has lost its case following the ruling of the Competition Commission, which would require it to reduce its stake in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeals Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its shares of ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The commission said that, in the past, MSkyB’s involvement had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement to prevent NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV shares cast doubt on ITV's effective independence, prompting the Competition Commission to investigate the matter.
Virgin boss Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the Ofcom regulator were all against this purchase.
BSkyB countered that forcing it to reduce its shares in ITV would not be reasonable and instead was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just relinquished its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of US prosecutors.
The U.S. attorney general appointed a special accuser to investigate the issue of firing nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole thing was born from the account of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special accuser Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officers interviewed during the investigation lied to investigators, thus obstructing justice.
“Serious charges of potentially criminal, unsubstantiated conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved,” Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser to compel witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the December 2006 delisting of nine U.S. prosecutors by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department said prosecutors were fired because of poor performance.
But then it emerged that dismissed prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to attribute these dismissals to a political connotation.
Some prosecutors have been accused of being close to congressional Republicans, while others have reportedly refused to investigate fraudulent voting charges against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting lawsuits for the government.
Of course, they can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The head of the justice department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ends up accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end, he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers from the Justice Department have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was highly critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "primarily responsible" for these redundancies, and ended up "abdicating" his leadership role, "remarkably succeeding in not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush aide Karl Rove, were critical of failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic must be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was “honored” to get this recognition.
The nine-minute, fifty-second song was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The award night is presented by Coldplay, with this year’s selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly does.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a big voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song went on sale in the UK as a single in 1979, ranking 15th.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the English charts, and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - or Marvin Lee Aday, his real name - has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing an operation to cure his heartbeat that became irregular, after collapsing on stage, in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngite forced him to cancel concerts.
Then he found a cyst in the vocal cords.
A dark street in the city, often forgotten, and may soon be for sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents don’t know how to get to Extra Place because they’ve never heard of it.
The street is in the East Village and runs north of First Street – not to be confused with Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks like a dusty driveway rather than an active artery.
. There are no signs to indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
However, this street has admirers.
For example, there’s Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repaint Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to the shops and boutiques, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-time neighbors, have said they are charmed by this shortcuts simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets in the block.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood landlords’ committees, representatives from city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal to allow the property builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee 3.
“There’s only a small amount of space left in the city, and we’d like the city to keep Extra Place,” she said.
“They could offer to refurbish it and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public.”
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to restore the small street and install seats, some of which would be used by a café to which the builder will concede space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, the spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to operate the street, that doesn’t necessarily mean it wants to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s main interest is to re-look at this abandoned driveway, and make it public,” she said, noting that it was the city that suggested the sale to her.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Real Estate Preservation, confirmed that the city wants to sell the street, stressing further, that the mission of the agency was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has had this name since 1802, when the legacy of Philip Minthorne's large children's farm was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since remained abandoned.
The back entrance to the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, has re-opened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Ramones manager Danny Fields, who took the picture in November 1976.
It was full of scraps, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.”
Some residents, including bloggers who had previously talked about the East Village’s evolution towards luxury, objected to the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others proclaimed Extra Place as a real rarity – a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be done away with in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at A City in the Extinction Process") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small, narrow cul-de-sac, dark day and night, and bounded by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and blinds, full of last week's newspapers that fly along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs nimblely down the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and has now become the seat of a fancy clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce bottle of beer, lies next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
Some passers-by said they rarely think about Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Field, for his part, said he thought some undervalued the street's appeal in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “were spent in dark, damp, disgusting places.”

Obama’s campaign points out that “African-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students.”
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama’s education program particularly supports among many other topics, “bilingual transitional education” for those learning English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that defends classroom instruction in languages other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the east side of Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are mostly Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of the students, made up of many newcomers, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 State Maths Exam, Expert Level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students took the English-language-arts exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than that put forward by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, a constant assessment of abilities and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, this school has established the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
Total immersion in the English language focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you would have had no chance to identify him."
"It works," she observes, "it worked for us."
Shouldn’t Obama take the Sixth Street Prep as an example and replicate it in other schools, which are mostly Hispanic students learning English?
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within his party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and his enormous support for bilingual education obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama’s response.
While he is in favor of immigrants learning English, Obama recently dismissed the issue as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop arguing about the wording of laws in the English language.
Instead, he said, “you have to make sure your child speaks Spanish.”
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than dismissing them or considering them to be insignificant.
Net Oil Fall Following the New Worries of the World Economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday, as people fear that the bailout in favor of financial markets will succeed in reviving the economy.
Crude oil futures fell 7 per cent to $99.80 per barrel. The Mercantile Exchange of New York, during sales this morning.
Prices have dropped more than $20 a barrel since Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After experiencing an increase to $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in the face of deep financial market uncertainties.
This Monday, investors are again worried despite the agreement on the bailout, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis will be protracted.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster, "Citygroup will purchase the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation," the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said this weekend’s frenzied negotiations with the bailout deal “seem to have failed to revive the market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and trading markets has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not escape this contagion.
“When it comes to raw materials, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the U.S. virus would spread globally and in particular, in China.”
Analysts at the bank have reduced their expectations for next year, given the decline in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, were therefore forced to reduce by 20 percent, the oil and gas price forecasts for 2009.
The party of the Second Determinant Time for the Improvement of the Record of the Team.
After spending more time in the last eight seasons than anyone else in a Jets Shaun Ellis uniform, the defenseman thought he’d seen it all.
He was watching the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Ellis said.
The second time started after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals dirtyly played under dark clouds.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor of an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for another two touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from halftime.
“I didn’t get out of my zone,” Favre said of all his passes at Coles.
"He's a mediocre player."
"We communicated extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing wrestling, the defense beat Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a missed shot and made 32 yards until the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of the Bowens ball, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking an advantage of 34-0.
It was the best the Jets could score in a while.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this insanity, said "second time or third?"
When told the two - the Jets let 21 unquestionable points pass in the third time - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third.
"A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, surpassing his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, from Ethiopia, has once again proven himself worthy of his title as the best long-distance runner of the century, after breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win in 2:03:59 of an accommodative race on the flat, Gebrselassie beat his record of 2:04:26 last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, the 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing – perhaps exaggeratedly in today’s eyes – that air pollution would increase her asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the finish- Gebrselassie won Sunday, maintaining an impressive average of one mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted to cross country runners, have contributed to the marathon record drop of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday’s win, Gebrselassie told reporters, suffered calf cramps two weeks before, and missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain brilliant, but not rusty.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I got back to it last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went well.”
He has been blamed – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s African rival – for orchestrating his races too much, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually counting on the hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering world records more than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s abilities as a long distance runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. halfway.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the front-runners disappeared.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final comeback to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best five-minute personal record.
Kamathis came third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Kazakhstan-born Irina Mikitenko, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with the seventh time of 2:19:19.
England’s Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing games because of a hypothetical backache, but promised to win in Berlin, improving on her third marathon, her personal best of almost five minutes.
She ran using a clever strategy, letting the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners take a nice advantage, then surpassing them about 18miles 1/2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, Pride and the trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the sun, the brilliant and the giant Orlando, is a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first all-black town to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make these days." The city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and no jail."
It has now become a city of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora Festival in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city it describes- became touristy thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project- remains a place of its own.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was already in the 1930s, when Hurston recounted that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share his true thoughts with the white man, who “knowing us so little, doesn’t know what he’s losing.”
Even if this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious of the foreign eye.
“We’re very careful about how to tell the story,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and the oldest parishioner in the city.
"It has to be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of a black takeover and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of southern black rural culture - sometimes despised, other times acclaimed - which recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through sincere, dialect-filled books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just off Route 17, a road that crosses central Florida, often forgotten, that culminates in a chapter of black history and human drama.
Bold in life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was then divided into several private parts.
"Passing the road on the left," she writes, "you'll find the modern brown and white public school, with its well-preserved gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller has always cared for, though he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can be used by people passing by.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with literacy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn’t actually a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's young girls whom Hurston immortalized, citing colorless songs performed by men who praised their beauty.
She added, “Some people didn’t like it.”
Hurston is still remembered as a lively and eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, in a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in the mouth and wore pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin recounted, while many laughed at her.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” he said.
But he further adds, swaying in his back patio chair overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some grave in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no major commemorations or plaques for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy she gave to the world," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a 2003 biography of Hurston.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Public officials in Orange County wanted to move a five-lane highway into town, replacing Kennedy Boulevard, the community’s main two-lane street.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal came as Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the race mixing dispute brought hatred to the gates of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of young white people were coming to throw oranges or objects at the people sitting on the side," Franklin said.
“A lady has even died.”
They threw a watermelon from their car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education as "insulting rather than glorifying my race".
Residents now proclaim that eliminating racial segregation in schools, while positive in some aspects, has diluted Eatonville’s cohesion and weakened young people’s confidence.
"Black children used to be kissed -- I remember -- we kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening too," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief director of the Eatonville Community Safeguards, a non-profit group.
It lasted, she added, until teachers and students did not come from the same place.
“You don’t kiss your white teacher because he’s white – I mean there’s a cultural dividing line here,” Nathiri said.
Civil rights, by the way, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond prejudice, such as her, armed with a joyful self-confidence and guidelines such as: "How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
This is beyond me.”
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited Hurston's anonymous grave and began fighting to revive his reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real bestseller, reintroduced it to American cannons.
The highway project came just when Eatonville’s most famous girl had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston’s old neighbors see her as a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of the highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county pushed back the highway proposal.
"The fiasco of the five-lane highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd summed it up by stating that "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been listed as a historic city since 1998.
A single theme library (of course renamed Hurston) opened in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repaved.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back street on a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(There are now 90 percent blacks.)
Foreigners who come to discover Eatonville's history, its raison d'être, are still treated with caution.
You have to ask permission for most interviews, and some things – like the walls of the old Eatonville church, painted by the white man, depicting black men in the fields – should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a courageous teacher with a soft spot for bright red, are always afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, with the expansion of the Hurston Festival, a certain level of local pride emerged.
Young people in particular tend to view Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, no better or worse, but as proud, creative, hardworking, crazy and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is genuine civic affection that is heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger ones, like 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people who pass through this area will think, 'Oh, this city has not compared anything to others,'" Kenon said after mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone is fluent in finance.
Despite everything, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they’re in the eye of the cyclone.
Never could they think that in the glass and honeycomb desks above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York City, are spending the worst “workday in the office” since the 1929 crack.
Deliverers continue to sneak onto sidewalks, with their carts and trays of muffins for morning meetings.
The Latinos always drag between residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke arranged on his shoulders.
Office workers continue to line up to buy their morning sandwich from street vendors, and it’s still impossible to find a taxi between 4pm and 7pm on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic accounts until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work in the late afternoon, because I discovered at my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, about twenty people waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's counters, or to withdraw cash or make a payment, but in front of the customer service counter, where the usual customers ordered their checkbooks, the tourists asked the management for the Macy's store, and the new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorized personal banker", were all in line for the same reason as me.
Not in the same way, as they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They withdrew their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that operate only in one state, and which claim to treat customers like their families.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of $327, has appealed to the bankruptcy trustee, and while New Yorkers were returning home for the weekend this Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save her.
The office and the store employees in front of me, scared of another potential debacle, transferred their money to a bank that seems to them reliable, the one that does the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
“I was hearing a lady at my local Chinese supermarket talking on the phone to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and its meager CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had in criticizing a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed concierge of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries from my fruit and vegetable merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market.
“I’ve changed, I don’t want to take a risk.”
Desecrated Muslim tombs as Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, are taking part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs depicting mosques striped in red.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery over the weekend of the victory of far-right political parties in the country's general election.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the cemetery in Traun, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; according to police, this is an organized action.
The delinquents painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on several graves; detectives believe, however, that this could have been done to disguise extremists' feelings of hatred towards Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somehow related to the elections?
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said he was “deeply shocked” at the announcement of the desecration, which comes just during the religious month of Ramadan, which is coming to an end.
Austria is seriously thinking of regaining its courage, following its swing to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that won nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, ran an anti-immigration campaign, with some of their slogans seen by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, led his campaign against wearing headscarves and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties tried to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter banned from travelling abroad.
The courts have banned the glamorous rock star, Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he expressed to the authorities that have him under control, his intention to go to Spain through France.
Police in Kent issued the travel ban on Thursday after proving Glitter guilty of child sexual abuse.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing in Ashford's courts of limited jurisdiction, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: “On Thursday, 25 September at Ashford Court, Kent Police requested an application to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
“Paul Gadd wasn’t there then.”
Glitter, 64, has informed authorities that he wants to go abroad, even if he wants to be registered in the list of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they would not discuss any particular cases or potential Glitter moves in the story.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “The Kent Police will do whatever it takes to protect our children as well as those abroad.
“In our view, it’s easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because we have devices that can manage any potential risk much more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is Kent Police’s most cherished intention, and we closely monitor the behavior of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, in order to minimize potential risks to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he did not feel well, and refused to leave for London.
Thai authorities blocked him from passport control, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry, so he was forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to Uxbridge Court of Limited Jurisdiction, West London, to register him in the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a four-month sentence in the UK for possession of child abuse images.
An interior ministry source said Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from travel in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the scene to capture elements of his character" G?nther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of the man or the woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these moments unknown to the general public, where one discovers to intimate gestures and stolen looks of artists who do not care to go on stage.
In "Flamenco - people" the German G?nther Bauer mixes the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Flemish Month of Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater each day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy ... by captivating the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists do not take photos on stage.
They have a personality and character of their own.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera moments of personality of flamenco stars."
With the festival "Song of the Mines", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, recall classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about dance or singing itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the public with his art.
The search for the essentials and magic has been the constant of this work that we present these days at the El Fot?mata gallery.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy artists photographed.
The project turned into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book collecting portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing people's portraits, getting to know them and being able to enter their lives for a more or less long time.
I believe that in photography portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You are in front of people, characters that sometimes you do not know or who leave you only a few minutes to take a picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is on display at the El Fotomata Gallery, located at number 20 of the rue de la Mata (street parallel to the Peopleraie d'Hercule) which will be open until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true audacity"
The novel takes place in places no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project he is working on, a novel whose main character is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and who passed through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize winner confessed yesterday at the Hay Segovia festival that the novel that currently occupies him "is a real audacity" and that "everything demonstrates that he should not write it".
“If I were reasonable, I wouldn’t do it, but I’m going to do it and I hope to finish it,” he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people march through the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award by the majority of the votes of the participants, sold out at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself in front of a fascinated audience who did not see the past hour during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote his "very methodical way of working" thanks to a "very methodical way".
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives. "But I refuse to believe that literature is pure fun, a fleeting experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less alike," because writers were asked "not to let go of their frivolity."
Bad weather spoils the fair of Pozoblanco
The banderilla festival that concluded the bullfights at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse-riding bullfighters checked that the arena was impassable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Ferman Boharquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull run.
The bad weather was fierce on this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
Saturday it was rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
José Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista should have played each other in the Castilblanco arena.
So only the Friday party took place.
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was worn in triumph, after making arm movements facing the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banderillas planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the uncovered stands applauded more than his fight in itself with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was hissed by most of the public.
Police check of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five hours minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Euskadi police (the Ertzaintza) on the border of the Municipality of Armin (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the two undertake the escape.
Its loading, more than two tons of hashish, enough to stop them.
The police pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to information released by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and document falsification.
The incident took place when various officials of the Traffic Unit of the Alava were carrying out a control of the vehicles on the N-1, on the border of the Commune of Armion.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly sped up and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further down the aisle, where the two occupants descended to flee into a wooded area.
Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hash bales and then transferred to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate had been "falsified" since it did not coincide with the one written on the gray card of the van, it is also for this reason that they charged the detainee with a crime of falsification of documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and determine the source of the seized drug.
The inmate, 28-year-old A.A.J., was taken into custody to carry out the various procedures and will be tried within hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the effect of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Birbara, California for driving under the effect of a drug.
A witness saw her doing strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesman for the California police patrol revealed to People magazine.
The witness said that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "pressing the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going in reverse several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who initially did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of his vehicle.
That person, at the time, called the emergency services because “she was worried about Locklear’s life.”
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented," which is why the officers took her to the drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the beginning, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was incarcerated around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear came out of the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former councilor of Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of carrying out preferential treatments to members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the behavior of the political party he will have to adopt in the Seville city council.
However, the leader of the United Left asked that the investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended such cases so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also pointed out that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all civil servants".
"Sangre de Mayo", the daring bet of Garci
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdus, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros in budget.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarria at the head of the long list of actors.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour film, "Sangre de mayo" will be released in theaters next Friday, which will then become a TV series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Galdis’s literature, claims to have realized with this filming “a childhood dream” thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to shoot a commemorative film for the two hundred years of Madrid’s 2nd May, something he always accepted when the story stuck to national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Commune of Madrid constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that has been mistaken leader for the fight, since, the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he could not shoot a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcarcel, with whom he collaborated during almost all his career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a empezar" has influenced his usual way of working, on the staging of actors, with whom he is used to rehearse before starting the shooting and to whom he does not cast, since it seems "humiliating" to him and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and the cinema to keep informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" rehearse in front of the camera, such as Miguel Renlan, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar contender (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, “Sangre de mayo,” “Seven French pool tables” and finally the winner, “The Blind Sunflowers,” are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, “that would deserve to be better known,” he said.
With this movie Garci does not expect a price.
“At first you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize that you’re only working for prosperity, and now you’re just making an extra movie,” Garci says after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayon puts herself in the shoes of the Sevillian dancer T?rtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer will pay tribute to a dancer also Sevillian.
Carmen Tartola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the neighborhood of Triana and at the age of three will go to live in London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset which prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayon.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me the opportunity to play the Sevillian dancer Tortola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me.”
According to the dancer, “we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "butterfly dance" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to hers,” she says.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done at "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally kindly collaborated with her who was his student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature character.
I’m happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and that honors me.”
The staging was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesus Torres y Paco Arriaga, to the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Moron; to the percussions of El Pajaro, as well as to the viola of Rafa El Viola and to the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juarez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion".
This work also tells, in a certain way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in such distant places, especially for the time, as in India, in the United States, or in Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think it’s these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and showcases her work,” says Bayon.
The show will start at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennale
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a Newly Married Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church in New York, the place where Juan Ramon Jimenez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennate Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized in order to commemorate their 50th anniversary of the Nobel Prize.
In this way, the "Zenobia and Juan Ramon Triennate" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramon Jimenez: This Poplar of Light" that was inaugurated last May and that, after traveling to the various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York during the Congress.
In the same way, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia has bought eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the best-known Andalusian poets.
America Enjoys Less Without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in “Absence of Malice,” and illustrates the desperation of American cinema, and all of America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had a hard time getting an Oscar.
He hasn’t been touring since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and now I've lost a great friend," said Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of his existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly dark period, when terrorists and stock markets are frightening, the esteem of Americans has fallen very low, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, there is nothing left to human beings but admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of his elder who died following an overdose and the creation of his own brand of organic food.
It was a victory for a country that struggled to prevail against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“He raised the bar for us,” said Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today trying to break through the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious private life and away from goals.
It’s still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even if the opportunities did not miss him not to be.
“But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?” he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
"Of all the great roles he has played, he has never been more proud than that of the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropist," he said.
Madrid in the race to host the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it could come true in 2016.
I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday’s race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst race I’ve ever competed in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of a playoff note.
But let’s look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
Mistakes begin with the removal of bibs, which forces you to go ahead.
It's not bad but if they make you move it would be better if they gave you everything (including the microchip for shopping).
Well no
They made you go there only to take the bib (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small size jerseys with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Apart from the fact that it is necessary to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, moreover, it is necessary to leave his backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults of the barracks took place.
I believe about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me won't even figure in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that I think didn't mark the start correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to give an example of a perfect race, this one wouldn’t come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft introduced a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company's campus) in response to what was asked during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who they are - including remembering what positions they occupy - and listen and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that they do not belong to the group that is talking to them and that they are not part of the company.
She asks him if she is here to visit someone and she tells him that she will answer him in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the essential instead of useless applications, they would go five times faster.
This is a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance, but so is its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on Google’s part to compete with Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary as it is the indispensable basis for computer hardware and software to understand each other.
It holds the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but we must see the "death" of the operational system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
We turn on the computer only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who serves half of the applications that come with the system?
Who can the most can the least.
And Windows 7 will need to have fewer apps, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, cluttered month, less complex.
For now, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of Microsoft’s employee-only rest rooms in Redmond.
On the beverage dispenser, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will surely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, so it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso endorsed him on the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the outfit of the association of muscular gays.
And if we begin to list all his appearances, we could also mention this heavy mustache who lifted weights in a traveling circus.
It’s not just a simple, sleeveless, tight, men’s cotton bodysuit.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others.
First of all, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with the sport since it takes the name, according to the legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' is distinguished from the others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the little Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the most famous bodysuits have in the neck.
But beware, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babes, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it is a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
“I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn’t worry me.”
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
She was present at the promotion that the brand Mango made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important awards of the fashion that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but, at the same time, exciting day awaits us.
What is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season based on?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s enchants us and we are very inspired by it for our collections.
I like to walk around the city and watch women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you're a very versatile woman: isn't it?
I think so, but in the end everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Ever since I was a little girl I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s to look in my aunt’s cupboards and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of the way I dressed.
Dancers like to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you take on the clothes, that’s when you really put yourself in the character’s shoes.
All of a sudden, everything is connected.
You were not long ago 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I'm feeling better than ever, my 30s are cheering me up.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with fewer problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I’ve done all the things I wanted to do since I was little and it gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think you're going to be a mom?
Of course, I want to be a mom because my body asks me to, and, moreover, I want to be a young mom; I don’t want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let’s go to the cinema, you’re waiting for the different films you shot last year to come out.
That's right, I can't wait for them to come out.
I am a woman from the theater, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I can’t wait for the films ‘La’ltima hora’ and ‘En busca de la tumba de Cristo’ to come out.
Let's see what you think...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the bridge to do the modeling.
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I’ve known her for quite some time, to invite me to participate in a London charity show for her women’s support association and the clothes we were showing – I showed off two clothes from our collection created for Mango – were auctioned off to raise money for Naomi’s NGO.
People that Naomi is a tender-hearted person.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
I'm also fascinated by this good side of Naomi.
She asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear tree, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for Third World women.
Alcohol abusers at the wheel will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcohol, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the vehicle in a state of drunkenness, or if he does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and it is now reflected in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered as a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State in charge of road safety but also the Directorate General of Road Safety and the Technological Institute Foundation for Motor Vehicle Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for having driven in a drunken state more than once, takes the car back.
The alcolock would avoid this since it is a system plugged into the vehicle that measures the alcohol level in the breath and prevents starting the vehicle if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is the responsibility of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of infringements during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people every year.
This only applies to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with such behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, however, the reform done by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system in school buses as it was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., the plane of the Spanish Air Force in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juarez airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of sunset but its rays still forced to put the hand as a visor to be able to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver in the street if he was aware that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official trip.
- Ah, all right, so we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... Are you from here or...?
- No, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking two years.
- Ah, all right...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of travel.
Several are waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and at a military row made up of 27 marines.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a thunderstorm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before passing in the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny journalist from Mexican television is waiting for them.
The most prestigious fashion award
There is surely no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and there is surely no living designer more extraordinary and bon vivre than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Boton-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, was looking at her models in the Mango window at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she was almost crying with emotion.
Certainly it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the competition, made that we ended up in a luxurious dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the table next to that of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango, seemed even more spectacular.
Big on her heart and bad luck good heart, because of the recent death of her brother, Nati put on a garment of Mango and some adornments of ELAH, which cut the breath, and arm in arm with her son Luis - a beautiful man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron de Rotchil ended the evening without a coat because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner metamorphosed into a sexy and black long dress, was moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the rehearsal room of the ballets and remembering the good old days, she grabbed one of the bars and made the big gesture.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the outbuildings of the palace, but she showed us before on her mobile phone pictures of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martinez – another handsome man who travels by motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked beforehand, that there be no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all off, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to booksellers on September 30.
The alarm clock almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 o’clock, but it’s even worse when we think about the hectic pace imposed on us by current life.
The desk is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, neither one more nor one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is entitled '1001 Ways to Relax' and will arrive at booksellers directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places like work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn’t run through your veins to restore your body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking while sleeping
Some children talk at night.
I do not relate to those who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who talk during their sleep.
The first time it happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquia.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, there is more than one person talking at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often linked to other sleep alterations such as nightmares, night terrors, bedwetting or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, situations of stress or overexcitation.
In any case, it is a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also highly variable.
It may be that he speaks with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, whispers or on the contrary with cries, tears, long speeches ...
In the event that sleeping sickness becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment unless it is related to another sleep alteration that can be cured (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are more or less violent.
With children who are very nervous and have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as sleeping sickness appears try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It's useless since he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he’s saying (which isn’t usual), don’t be tempted to question him for information.
You won’t get anything, because when he sleeps, he’s not conscious so he can organize his thinking.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, do not worry, this is nothing very nasty, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern has finally found the way to victory on his field after a long period of scarcity.
Without making a big match, the Yellows and Blacks created the greatest number of chances and managed to transform one for the win of the match.
The pace was not very strong during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann who was approaching the skylight on a shot from a distance, Illhaeuserrn was going to take slightly the ascendant and in turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn above, Romain from the end of the foot or Diebold came tickling the defense of Dannemarie.
Opposite, we made a block in the middle of the field and we just left the moving Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to take a ball repelled on a first attempt of Diebold (53').
But the scorer Illhousiens will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates outnumbered.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose big problems to an Illhousian Eleven who has just retreated a little to "compact" his defense, except in the very last seconds of play where, after a big cramming, the ball passed very close to the cross.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of strength of the fishermen who strongly disrupted Monday the accesses of several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in Finistère, to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general assembly of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of the soaring price of diesel, which has reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per liter on average.
According to the spokesman of the Elysée David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is eagerly awaited by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île not stopped.
A filtering dam has been set up on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination by burning, from dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic and Channel coasts, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where trawlers remained at the dock, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the movements of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important refinery Total de Donges.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday’s meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
At Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide Tuesday on the follow-up to be given to the movement and its participation in the interview planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go" and "do not want to move to Paris", for example announced Liliane Cariou, the president of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but they estimate that the break-even point of a boat is only reached with a diesel below 0.30 euro per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer, at the age of 83, in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes praised the film legend and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that hang over the world economy.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 aircraft delivered, its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado, said.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot from the Chinese market especially for its aircraft of the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which the US monetary authorities have bailed out, plans to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that was advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement activity in the United States, said the newspaper, citing sources close to the matter.
The board of directors of AIG met Sunday evening to consider possible divestitures, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG plans to divest include its air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59 percent stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and investments in private equity, the FT said.
No final decision has been taken on these divestitures, continues the FT.
AIG must quickly raise cash to repay the $85 billion loan it received from the Federal Reserve at the risk that the U.S. authorities will take 80% of its capital, diluting current shareholders in proportion.
Analysis Paris Session history Morning Meeting Historique Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange fell on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to rescue banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The technology-dominant Nasdaq index dropped 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank in after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bank rescue plan which was to allow to regain a little stability in the markets.
By 228 votes in favour and 205 in favour, the representatives refused the Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“This is a bad signal to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“It shows how much the market was counting on this plan,” she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would arrive “too late.”
“If the project is indeed moribund ... then the relay will be quickly passed to the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions,” warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, said Ms. Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the acquisition of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, pushing for emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not only a US crisis, but a global crisis,” added the analyst of FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bill fell to 3.632 percent, from 3.827% on Friday night, and the 30-year yield to 4.161%, from 4.357% the day before.
Obama wins first televised duel
At the first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House succeeded another to know who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen says McCain's performance, while honorable, has not been "brilliant" enough to stop him from falling in the polls five weeks into the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% against 44% for McCain), believes that it was the Democrat who pulled the plug.
Among undecided voters, who count, Obama came out on top for 39 percent of those polled, while 25 percent gave McCain the win, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead Thursday with the good performance expected from his running mate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts," Clinton said this weekend.
The septuagenarian McCain has repeatedly highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while highlighting the “naive” of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that,” he repeatedly accused.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama said he was the future.
Without disassembling himself, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain has still not understood, while Obama has,” retorted, this weekend, a Democratic spot criticizing the Republican for not having taken the full measure of the impact of the crisis on the “American of the street”.
"During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama told an election rally in North Carolina in a pouring rain.
He didn’t even utter the words “middle class” or “workers.” The financial rout clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most likely to save the economy on the brink.
“The coming week could be a turning point,” said the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to Bill Clinton’s during the 1998 financial crisis.
The current debacle is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
Reiterating that he would still succeed in reducing taxes by 95% of Americans despite the jolts of Wall Street, the senator from Illinois also pointed out that the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain wants to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Cautious, the two candidates dodged questions about the $700 billion financial rescue package passed last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice that there was an election?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative elections.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening as soon as polling stations closed in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some say they didn’t even vote: “What’s the point, since they’ll do what they want with my voice,” says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good appearance to foreign observers in order to resume language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turning point.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of some assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
“We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not able to participate in the recount,” said Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and here at home, it is the executive power.
If opposition MPs enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions, and proposed laws.”
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "we must start the dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we don’t reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, will recognize the validity of the vote.
She points out that the turnout figures seem too high, and that the generalization of advance voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all manipulations.
“You noticed that there was an election, you? asks the social democratic leader Alexandre Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are best suited to power.”
The silence of the night falls on the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission welcome their success.
Interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood suppliers in the world.
And most importantly, he regained the public trust that had been seriously shaken by the tainted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood supply managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service was contaminated with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and public outrage, the Government of Canada instituted a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for the recurrence of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was slow to table his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and Canadian Blood Services to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field during the years that followed, we regained the public's trust," she says before proudly affirming that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its creation on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, there were numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the one that has held the fort since its foundation in 1998.
“And we didn’t know at all whether this disease could be transmitted through blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when it is not known and a serious disease can result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, the blood of people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
However, a few years ago, it was shown beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle that we applied made sense.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for HIV testing appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (NATs), which make it possible to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
TANs have made it possible to shorten the silent period, which extends between when the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period was reduced to less than one week.
This has substantially reduced the risk of unknowingly infecting some donors and not being able to detect them.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
“In other words, it means we’ll have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I think we can now feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to regain health," said Héma-Québec's CEO.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
You never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Just last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide a sufficient supply.
“Needs are increasing because the population is getting older.
Since cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a refill of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population is also having an impact on the blood donor network, which on average accounts for only 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate blood.
Any healthy person 18 years of age or older who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a malaria-affected country, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With this 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But we need to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to become a regular donor.
Today’s life is so frantic, we rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood,” laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for burn victims.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is packed with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
A few weeks ago, we celebrated the banking of our thousandth cord blood sample and we plan to take more than a thousand a year.
We should start offering them for transplants early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot access it," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the semi-finals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinal round of the USL First Division playoffs with a 3-1 win (4-3 total goals) over the Seattle Sounders yesterday in the second and decisive quarter-final game of the total goals series at Stade Saputo.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of play.
After a first half without a goal on either side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other nets of the Montreal squad.
Roger Levesque was the only one to beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that in the first game of the round-trip series, Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the back game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the semifinal round 5-4 in total goals.
The Impact is set to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Kovalev's victorious goal
The Canadiens’ number one lineup is ready to start the season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the way in a 3-2 win over the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the game, scored a goal, Plekanec had two assists, and Kovalev had a pass in that win, the Habs’ fourth in six pre-season games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shootout.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
“He tried to do too much in the first half,” noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a great ovation.”
Charest bets on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out calling elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec City, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected on the occasion of today's by-election.
"Pushing the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the broad outlines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of Moulin à images.
Turned in a loop, on three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great resources such as during the election period.
In the press, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would call elections this fall, even though he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but did not give a deadline, amounts of investment, or a precise priority in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be further developed: notably hydropower, the forest, but especially the mining sector, boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains “nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond,” according to Charest’s enumeration.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it's with us, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it’s within us,” he insisted, as if to show that he was soliciting a national founding myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he pointed out: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
“It’s ours, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister during the press briefing.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line that has not been agreed on for a very long time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government,” he said.
“With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, referring to the northwest passage, which will open all year due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the people of the territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP for Ungava), have already begun consultations with some thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Plan Nord will be “concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of Liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the Liberals who came before us, we thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a great cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to rename the Centrale Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa who made the James Bay, our party knew how to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
In a press briefing, he invoked another conservative reference to this one, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydro-electric dam project, Mr. Charest noted that its commissioning was scheduled for 2012.
"It remains between us there, but I plan to be there," he told his activists, prompting strong applause in them.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling a poll this fall, which the law allows him.
He points out, however, that his schedule is fulfilled, notably by a mission of the council of the federation in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that passed like a letter to the post: the PLQ demands in particular the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and to veto decisions made in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the broad outlines of the Plan Nord were met with skepticism.
The PQ leader, Pauline Marois, emerged from the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, gave up applying it.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today" commented Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (scrutiny that takes place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supports the government's adoption of a Plan Nord.
“But what we want is that it’s not just a show,” commented leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (O irony) in the Harper cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to say that Louise Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
To cast shame on this woman who has fought tirelessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as it does Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, of all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its citizen locked up in the Guant?namo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the alleged acts.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier languish in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
For the record, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, are advocating for Omar Khadr’s repatriation to Canada for a fair trial.
It is this same government that turns a blind eye to torture: it does not matter that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We do not yet realize it, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the word that Harper keeps brandishing and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when no morals exist anymore: you can arbitrarily abuse, torture, imprison a Canadian citizen at the whim of a government leader who has so far been a minority (what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice-President of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Pursuing Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a six million libel suit against three authors and a small penniless publishing house in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation lawsuits, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
For Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to lead to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money to prepare their defence and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mining industry.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will gag the opposition and scare anyone who dares to look again at the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of public opinion that she should have presented her view of the facts.
Unlike many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are normally conducted through the exchange of ideas and not by batons.
So it was enough for the mining company to open its books, its files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold appears to be untrusting to public opinion and dismisses petitions and letters in support of Black Canada's authors.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can both ask for a "public" debate while disregarding the opinions of that same public?
In the Vice-President's world, it seems that this word refers only to the lawyers who are well paid and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public who support Black Canada's authors and publishers does so primarily because they reject the brutal way of mining.
This audience is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a gag order (pursuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a formal notice against the authors of Black Canada asking them to stop using this term ...).
Beyond Mr. Garver’s surreal discourse, Barrick Gold’s pursuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, en bloc, the right to the citation of credible sources and to the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss issues that are displeasing to the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate pursuit makes it clear that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for academia, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months still needs to be endorsed by both houses of Congress.
It includes: better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right of control over the salaries paid to the managers of rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative at the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
“We have made great strides toward a deal that will be effective in the markets,” said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Everything has been done in a way that shields the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“That’s the fundamental point: If we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos and disruption to the everyday lives of Americans will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned into a sprint in the last hours for fear of the effect that a new failure would cause on the mood of investors.
The deadline was the opening of the markets this morning.
Associated late in the negotiations, the two candidates in the US presidential election were rather favorable to the agreement, without failing to express however their dissatisfaction that one is forced to arrive at this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has attributed the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including the one to allow homeowners to keep their homes and the one on the salaries of executives of companies rescued by the state.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to celebrate.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on American television.
Asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The outline I read [shows] that it's something we're all going to have to digest and we're going to be able to move forward with.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to redeem with taxpayer money the bad debts, risky assets and unsaleable US financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages before spreading to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and leading to a liquidity freeze and the disbandment of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of elected Republicans who blew up the first draft of the agreement last week.
It is believed to have broken this deadlock since Democrats agreed that some “toxic” assets of troubled companies are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to round the corners for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to assume losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion to which can be added another 100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
Another $350 billion is expected to be approved by another congressional vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in the rescued companies that will earn him dividends in case of profit and that he can resell when the turmoil is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay foreclosure procedures for homes attached to mortgages covered by this plan, as well as set limits on compensation and severance payments to executives of affected businesses.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote in the House of Representatives today, and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Indeed, voices continued to speak out yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camp.
“Obviously Washington doesn’t hear you,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told voters.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not to take advantage of taxpayers.”
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed “the caucus of skeptics,” Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to tell us: Congress is being asked not to hurry and to carefully examine the way forward,” he said.
At the same time, in Europe, there was again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was giving up on acquiring its competitor in the middle of a shipwreck since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of Europe’s 20 largest banks and 10 largest insurers.
“This is not lost money,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In exchange, we get back a voting right in the bank and influence.
This is precisely something that savers and households now appreciate as times look uncertain.”
Meanwhile, across the Channel, the British government appeared to be nationalizing another bank battered by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank, including more than 41 billion (US 75.5 billion) of mortgage loans.
The Spanish bank Santander said yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
Its beauty in the eyes of azure was for a long time its asset card, some will say its weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that flowed from source will also have distanced him from the register of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
But what a great long-distance runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at age 83 from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the booming years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his play, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the bursting of dramatic conventions.
Mixed bloods often make beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, the ultimate brand of quality.
Because in him a whole country in love with the self-made man, the fighter of the Pacific war, wounded in combat, who in the early 50s studied drama at Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, television, soon in cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the second-placed driver at the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, dubbed a sex symbol, though a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the shadows of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to the bursts of show business, whose riddle we have not quite cracked.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The disappearance of Paul Newman has made moviegoers dizzy this weekend, as his big roles collide on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation scrolls through it.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a Burning Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, reprised after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic thug in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar for best film in 1973.
Bitter billiards player and vengeful in Robert Rossen's The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character on Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar out of nine nominations in 1987.
That face through the ages was him.
Just him again.
Times are moving through his journey.
The young people know him mainly through the cult Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a last role as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was complete.
Contrary to several film legends who soon let go of the profession, Newman remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its pomp and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging his performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles fell for a long time all cooked in the beak.
He played, however, less often the young first than the marginalized: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose perfect features reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed poorly known facets of his true modest sensibility.
Her Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former companion in arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, also fades a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of the excesses of Hollywood.
We will have seen a lot of his dinette sitting on jars of dressing, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process to be quite bad taste, although gag at first.
The profits from these sales were nevertheless paid to his Foundation for Children in Trouble.
Newman, rather than sit on his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in sum and in addition.
What could Zuschlag & Compagnie do in their invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings will begin, against Jonos Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are charged with fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, resulting in particularly significant damage. Other charges have been brought against them, such as forgery and the use of forgery.
According to the prosecutor's office, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the state and the municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand into the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand, into the pockets of certain people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to receive money from subsidies obtained by issuing bills of costs, behind which no actual benefits were provided and thus, the associations never met their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they procured invoice books at the market in Jazsefvros, while they manufactured the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were going to appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by Istvan Lados, at the request of Jonos Zuschlag.
According to the testimony of the latter, he had to locate pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they realized the other invoices that they would introduce, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by Istvin Lados and his accomplice Andrus Ari, who, according to our information, was mainly involved in drafting the files necessary to obtain the subsidies.
During a "tracking circuit", one of Lados's choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyes-let.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up in the name of the Jobb J?v?ért foundation, which would later be called Egy?tt a Harmadik Évezredért, was riddled with errors of form and substance.
One pension in Badacsonytomaj actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there, yet the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty guests.
The over-invented invoice issuers also fell into overdrive when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither Jobb Jov ért nor the Hopp name appeared, according to the information given to the prosecutor.
The company's manager, Gyuza Farkas, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor's office summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew, right away, that they were fake documents.
"Our company name and our tax number were placed in a wrong place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the bill, a hundred people stayed there, did not stick either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much room.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The zealous invoice issuers also did not inquire about Budapest's travel agencies, which are part of their choice, but only organise trips abroad, so naively they indicated trips to Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also goes against the agency's accounting practices.
Moreover, as it appeared during the survey, they also added VAT on these documents, while the services concerning travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices drawn up in the name of the Hotel Révf-l-p to Jobb J-v-ert was incorrect, since the company's services do not support a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT. In addition, the hotel's employees only issue printed invoices, while the fakes were written by hand.
The investigation of the prosecutor's office reveals that the "issuers" also committed errors by mentioning as a service the transport of goods by road, which the company issuing the invoices could not exercise, since its profile was the investment advice.
In addition, it is also for defects of form, such as inadequate types of invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued to the order of Egyatt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapattviny, of XXI.
As in the case of the company Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehért sports course, both of which deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
Nor did the counterfeiters pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., based in Nyaregyhza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) when the group of Fiatal Vorosért Egyeslet was supposed to have a meal at their home, which is why, according to our information, the liquidator of the company denies having issued this invoice.
Invoices deliberately drawn up
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj - Szocialist -k consortium, the Esély Budapestért Alap -tv -ny Foundation has issued an invoice to the Egy -tt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért for a sum of HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gyorfi.
Similarly, it cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the Jobb Foundation, the Atlasz Egyeslet association and the Vorsfeny Egyeslet association, for an amount of approximately HUF 5 million, but behind which no benefit was actually provided.
No financial movement took place either, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this, the organizations did avoid mentioning it in their accounts.
The next category of companies issuing invoices is that of companies directly related to the accused.
For example, the administrative representative of the managing director of Delta Trie Kft., dealing in the trade of fuel and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest but where it could not be found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of IT equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov also sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to the companies Atlasz, Hoppa and Egyatt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvany, and that he pocketed their counter value.
It was precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies were operating, which the accused explained by the fact that they were not receiving work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the founding acts of the companies, he drew up invoices in their names, to the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Generici.
Kubatov donated 15 invoices issued by the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to organizations for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
Prosecutors believed that 10% of the sums indicated on the invoices as well as VAT went into Kubatov’s pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictitious invoices that were used in the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generaci? and Sz?vetség a Modern Magyarorsz?gért applied for a subsidy from the public utility of the Socialist Party, T?ncsics Mih?ly Alap?tv?ny (TMA).
They obtained this grant for an amount of twice HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, it is these invoices that were found during the search carried out in the office of Orpud Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants will report on the method of manufacturing the invoices, as they had done before the prosecutor's office.
What could be really interesting would be that the main defendant, Jonos Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or perhaps the Socialists would have reached an agreement that in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably vexed, since applications for his placement under house arrest, on the basis of a reduction in his conditions of detention, are continually falling into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of unrepairable economic crimes, walk freely or at least wait in their own homes for the end of the proceedings.
The psychology of overbidding: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the merchandise.
Neurology and economics researchers at New York University have been able to uncover the neurological and economic underpinnings of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced during this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
This research has attempted to draw up a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group took part in a fun auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) process, the researchers analyzed the active brain domains of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, an essential element of which is the overbidding of a third, the whole under the brainstem, called striatum, moved intensively when the game was lost.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the nervous system's "self-stimulation" mechanism.
This is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight in front of the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the members of this group of researchers pursued financial surveillance analyses.
During these, three groups were overbidding a partner, under various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they made their bet.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they came out the winner of the game, then they would receive an additional $15, as a reward.
While the third group received the $15 before the auction, the group members also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is, in fact, that the emphasis was on victory in one group, while the emphasis was on failure in the other.
By thus proving the neurologists’ hypothesis, the members of the players’ team “against failure” were willing to bets higher than those made by the control group and the group “for victory”.
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by leading, now, to a third explanation." - found Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When should I see a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
There are an estimated one hundred thousand patients with hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven thousand are receiving treatment, due to the fact that often patients do not know they are carrying the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogens and diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through the blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
In any case, it is recommended for travellers to be vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating contaminated foods, usually accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, upset stomach and nausea.
Then develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible jaundice, the stool becomes lighter and the urine takes a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, one million people die each year from the most serious form of hepatitis B, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis.
The main cause is that it is estimated that only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know they have the virus, because the pathogenic gene deviously destroys liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms do not appear until after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users, and tattooed people.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis C worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its goal is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which would already have helped to make the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article according to which researchers from the University of Oxford carried out an interesting experiment by analyzing at what level belief in God could influence human pain tolerance.
As part of this bizarre experiment, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshock, while each of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments, in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More precisely, the experiment proceeds in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and diffusing electroshock is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings in a sustained way, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the Ermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers behind this experiment hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary evoked a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, focused on its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time, received 20 electroshocks in four parts succeeding each other, while looking at either the religious theme painting or the more general theme painting.
Catholics said that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe", like someone who was "taken care of" and they "calmed down, and peace invaded them".
At the sight of the painting of religious themes, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at the work of Leonardo.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that one can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in atheists, provided one finds the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image that they react to very positively, such as a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, praised the results of this research.
“The practice of faith should change and in many cases, actually changes our personality,” Wright added.
After these excellent results, there remains only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if one shows to the believers a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would the sight of a higher quality Virgin Mary cause better results?
You are what you reveal about yourself.
On its tenth anniversary, Google says it can be found in the back of people’s pockets just like the sky above their heads. It knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what their interests are.
But that’s not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the most influential people in society.
While when it comes to skeptics drawing a parallel with Orwell’s horror vision, they just don’t see the bulk of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can meet their initial goal which sounded like: "Let's collect all the world's information in one system!"
According to the Google executive interviewed, after ten years of a global shakeup, they are still only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
Schmidt responded that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like “What could I do tomorrow?” or “What would work best for me?” However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, when they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during searches on the Internet, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages consulted by interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they searched for, what they clicked on. Through this, in the long run, Recommendations, a program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services to us based on our previous statements and saved preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my job is? ask users, who are worried about Google’s information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly revolt against power that can arouse a counter-reaction among Internet users.
It is, however, a confirmed fact that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in this kind of legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most resounding example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Internet users concerned about human rights were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arming itself with the electronic legal protection agency EFF, proved its right in court before the FBI. According to the judgment rendered, in the future, Google will still not be able to be forced by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on the secret request of the FBI, of any kind whatsoever.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won over the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, passed several years earlier. But in the end, it failed to obtain the lists of searches of private users, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the past two months.)
Google’s judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is criticized by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their private sphere and their private domain suffer when they start using Google services, and therefore they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against multinational companies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its “savages” bringing together enthusiasts, activists and computer users who appear in many countries see Google as the next generation of big companies, the “connected corporation”, as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged as an invader of the world because of Windows, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The document code and the package of programs, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible effect, younger and cooler, in the face of the practice of the official giant of the software.
The reason may also be that geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet, and what the Web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, pulls right behind it.
Indeed, Web 2.0 is not about anything other than collaboration, than the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the communication channels available to us, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link these to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, he can link these to a tracking system, like FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also keep blogs, in which automatically appear their most recent photo galleries on Picaslick.
While we can read many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands at the sight of the photos of the morning, taken by the circle of mutual friends, with whom his infidel friend spent the evening, or that of the company that fired one of its employees, just for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management, we can be on one thing: the term of our privacy is totally to reconsider.
The one who lives an online life, is made up of what he shows himself, and this is how one can define the principle hiding behind the behavior of today's young people.
He wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to circumvent Google’s monopoly, can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not the least. Google online services, including word processing, image processing, reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not attached to huge server parks and do not assemble our best profile, which has existed until today.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding it, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion).Adwords/AdSense ad domains threaten ad agency revenue, while services introduced at an increasing speed cause serious migraines not only to Microsoft, but to many other computer program creators.
However, critical observers find, alongside all this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the top management of the company refused, in its entirety, the protests of the employees, after it has doubled the price of the kindergarten company and after the company has found too expensive the multiple restoration daily, taken at any time.
According to one of the company's internal rules, the new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is sure is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that the project of scanning and archiving books and magazines from Google is taking such important dimensions that the company will soon find itself facing our medical problems in the United States.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction writers. The famous Cory Doctorow's novel, written with Orwellian halftones, describes the future in which a man could be approached in an amazing way just through Google's data.
Two miners helped clear the tracks of the double murder of uzd
"Police have summoned two minors to question them in the case of the double homicide of Ozd. Based on well-founded suspicions, they helped to clear the traces of the crime." - said the spokesman of the police department of Borsod.
The young people have acknowledged the charges against them, and for the time being, they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who according to the information of MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are young girls, defend themselves free.
Complicity in murder can result in detention for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double homicide of 23-year-old local man, Ozd, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and it is for this reason that he lured his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in Ozd where he killed him, as well as the little girl of this man, 9 years old.
According to MTI information, the young man premeditated his crime and the weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the scene of the crime is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the acquisition of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Poles made despite the fact that previously the Czechs excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech business daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest bid to buy the Prague stock exchange so far.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the Stock Exchange of New York, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Boerse have made an offer so far.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the least good new owner, and did not rule out the fact that it could result in the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent stakes, followed by the 14.7 percent of the bank Cesk . Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, which is getting worse by the day, leading newspapers in the European press are already talking about a "second 11 September".
"The global financial catastrophe, we owe it to the American president" - accuses the daily of Rome, La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to stand with his own party behind a bill, improvised in a hurry, to help a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire Warren Buffett said, it is more appropriate to talk about a second 9/11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that brought the global economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is increasing every day, and the whole world will pay a heavy price.
Bush’s plan was far from perfect, however, according to the congressional vote, a real danger looms, one that Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in a vacuum, just when in the history of capitalism one of the greatest transformations is taking place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer - stresses the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states can still stretch a lifeline to their staggered financial institutions, and with their taxpayers’ money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, we need the states of the European Union to disregard their national egoism, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Viennese daily Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers too will have to put their hands in the pocket, very deep, in a way similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, become more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, runs through the old continent from one side to the other.
The "rescuers" must not immediately raise a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch the taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
Intelligent car mimics drone theft
What method would be better for developing technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if not the imitation of an obstacle detector already existing in nature?
Like, for example, the bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, held in Japan, buzzing bees gave Nissan engineers the initial strategic idea, to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired, BR23C-type, self-robotized control system, which it has equipped with the qualities of bees, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own space, oval in shape, which in reality, looks very much like our secure protective shell - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development and technological public relations department of the brand.
The bee’s faceted eye plays a vital role, as it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the faceted eye, engineers approached the idea of the laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, evaluates distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which turns it into an avoidance maneuver right away.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it by a sufficient angle to avoid collision.
Unlike any current system, this avoidance maneuver takes place entirely instinctively.
“If it wasn’t that way, the mini-auto robot wouldn’t be able to react fast enough to avoid the obstacle,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and Robotic Car Project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process should reflect what the bee is doing to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in the blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that the bees possess to avoid the other bees, in our case, we could only use the rotary movement, the acceleration as well as the slowing down as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini robot self.
The BR23C uses polymeric Lithium batteries that are lighter and have a larger energy concentrate, making their lifespan longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not data processing, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism has to process only a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
We don't need memory with gigabyte capacity, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology for instant avoidance, and Nissan estimates that this system will enter mass-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles in his path.
We even gave a name to the overpriced baby
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout, aimed at buying back the banks’ dubious loans, and to be used in installments, is ready.
In the first round, half of that money will be spent.
Reuters reports that in new debates lasting until after midnight on Saturday, local time on the east coast, congressional leaders have agreed on the days-and-days-old controversies surrounding the $700 billion bailout package.
“We’ve taken a serious step forward,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the American House of Representatives, who said all that’s left to do is put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, however other measures have yet to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question here of saving Wall Street, but of turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public ahead of the opening of Asian markets on Sunday evening at 8 p.m. local time in Washington (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to Central European local time), but did not cause a dramatic rise in the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill that meets the name of the emergency economic stabilization law of 2008.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
Moreover, the program diverges from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which stated that the $700 billion must be spent in one go, for the repurchase of securities on doubtful credits.
From now on, up to half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first $250 billion will be issued immediately after the law is passed by Congress, probably on Monday. This first amount will be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to buy bad loans from banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President.
The program will be overseen by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The spending of the second half of the $700 billion depends on a new congressional order.
Under the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to put in place a combined strategy: it will be able, at the same time, to buy bad debts, securities relating to bad mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" debts.
The competent persons of the Ministry have stated that the redemptions can take place in the context of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools that give rise to the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the necessary tools to spend $700 billion on the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the extensive redemption of doubtful debts, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the system leading to the collapse of one or the other major financial institution.
"We will make the necessary arrangements, to be ready for law enforcement, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank executives in bad shape and waiting for state aid can expect that their severance payments, simply called golden parachutes across the Atlantic, will be capped by the government.
The salary cap is only mentioned in specific cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers assistance to the business.
The capping principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys back through an auction, they will levy a tax surplus on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the bad loans are redeemed, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the executives is not exaggerated.
In order for the image to be complete, it must still be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The cap concerns only the new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in U.S. history that legal caps will be in place on CEO pay - said the chairman of the House of Representatives Financial Benefits Committee, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State acquires the right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can even win in the case as soon as the economy and with it the rescued banks fall on their feet.
The bill says that in the next five years, the president must introduce a proposal to Congress that will rule on how the losses are going to be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That’s not why American citizens mandated us, this doesn’t protect taxpayer dollars,” said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that it is the same people who are pressing for action, as those responsible for the Wall Street collapse.

Higher prices for plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly price increase in the chemical and chemical manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in the oil processing (1.4 per cent), electrical machinery and appliance manufacturing (0.9 per cent) and a minimal increase in the wood processing (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry saw an increase, ranging from 0.2 per cent to 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, representing a significant weight in domestic industrial operations, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in gas prices introduced by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, oil processing sector prices saw the most significant increase (32.4 percent).
In the metallurgical manufacturing sector, prices have increased by 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food, beverage and tobacco production, prices have increased by 11 per cent.
Price decreases occurred in the textile and textile products production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, price increases ranged from 0.6 per cent to 9.1 per cent.
Across the processing industry, prices have increased by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7 per cent higher than in the previous year.
Among the domestic trade groups and by sector allocation, in August, the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) was in the profit-making sectors.
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and materials production sectors for further processing showed no change from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the energy and materials production sectors for further processing (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was measured at 6.8 per cent, while in the profit-generating sectors, inflation was measured at 1.4 per cent.
The export sales prices of the industrial sector, in HUF, increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, while they suffered a drop of 3.9 percent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro, and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it strengthened by 7.5 per cent against the euro and by 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Gancz believes that there is a good chance that by January 12, the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will come into force, as the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
"Now everything depends only on when the electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic are put into operation."
All the time, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to check in before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will present the Commander’s Cross decoration with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and have a meeting with foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support bank bailout
On Sunday, Barack Obama as well as John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, assured of their support for the government’s $700 billion bailout; however, there are politicians who are demanding the resignation of the US Treasury Secretary.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, representatives in Congress and the Administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they have reached agreements in principle on the bailout of banks.
This financing plan, aimed at thawing the crisis on Wall Street and the crippled credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as better than the other, to drive the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the focus on economic issues, Obama has again managed to get a little ahead of himself, and McCain’s lead, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as running mate just after the Republican convention, has faded.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he too supports.
"Now is the time to act, with responsibility ... a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy," he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to describe McCain’s economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, “We’ll all have a hard time swallowing it... but doing nothing is not a possible path.”
The Republican senator stated that in the proposal, the creation of a Treasury Control Commission and the capping of severance pay for senior leaders are mentioned, and that he is, personally, very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will pass the bill as early as Monday.
The press review of the German linguistic territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is how Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
Christian socialists have been transforming Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who are turning their backs on them.
This change of era is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but on Sunday came to an end a process that was likely just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU stood at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the fifties, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is to say at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devouring his parents", implemented in the region consistently by the CSU.
Sociologists have been saying this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong about the pace. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans from the north and east in the rapidly developing region of Bavaria could not be without consequence on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only inside the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it is precisely the groups of classic citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as the self-employed, artisans, holders of the baccalaureate and graduates of higher education.
In these groups, support for UHC fell below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? Who? Party presidents stand on reserve in the face of coalition issues", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the confused domestic political situation that took hold after the Austrian elections.
The Socialists of Austria in the SPI want to talk to the conservatives in the SPI.
The P.P.S. is not allowed to interfere in its internal affairs.
The populist BZ party is open to negotiations, and the Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
Elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during debates held on public television, party leaders have barely hinted at their cards.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPI, confirmed that he wanted to talk with the SVP.
It wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in certain regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question of whether he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the European Parliament, as vice-chancellor, remains open on Faymann's part.
As he mentioned, the Schussel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the Reds' proposals.
As he has already said, a collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the IVP.
In his party, the choice of the opposition or the entry into the coalition is momentarily a very open question. These points must absolutely be debated within the .
The President of the BZ, J?rg Haider, is once again open to all proposals.
“To avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to assume governmental responsibilities,” Haider said.
Mr. Jarska said: We need to break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation.
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began in Paris as a representative of the current presidency of the European Union.
In her message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Fidesz MEP, Ms. L.J., drew attention to the segregation in education, as it is a violation of the law that most affects Roma children and, therefore, one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil organisations, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz People's Party MP's group, J?r?ka warned that in addition to the distinctions noted during the hiring, the Roma disappear from the labor market, in the first place, following their low qualification.
“An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school degrees, and as a result of poor elementary education, only a tiny fraction have the opportunity to graduate.”
In addition, he stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in the realization of other fundamental rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of European Union member countries.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in as wide a circle as possible, also between Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the earlier a Roma child starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the State budget.
"Because of their nationality in the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to a quality education, and be protected from a low-quality and sectarian education."
According to the MEP, a European Union collaboration oriented towards an objective and action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools. For this, compliance with existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be given the opportunities provided by democracy so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe" - demanded Mr. Jarska.
In the name of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities" assured for all, the objective of the Summit for Equal Opportunities in Europe held every year since the summit in Berlin last year is to ensure a single platform to support the measures taken in favour of equal opportunities and for the fight against discrimination, aimed at the European level and at the level of the member countries.
CSU: grace for a period of transition
It is in October that the decision on the fate of the deposed Huber-Beckstein duo will be taken.
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been adjourned.
The party president, Erwin Hube, and the head of the regional government, Gunther Beckstein, can still hold their place. The question is how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic vote loss of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the congress of the exceptional party, held the last weekend of October.
The members of this much criticized pair have, in any case, made it felt that they did not hold especially to their seat.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the furious members of the faction and base, who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the peak of his career - the Christian-socio union won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was Bavaria’s “single sovereign” giving 18 percent of Germany’s GDP.
But the Conservatives still count strongly in this region of the south, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal redevelopment of the party, the vice president and federal agriculture minister, Horst Seehofer, presented as Huber's possible successor, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates groping discussions with the liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Munich government.
A strange foot of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Voters, enters into the legislation the Gabriele Pauli, whose taking of action against Stroiber served as a putsch possibility perpetrated by the Huber-Beckstein duo, to then treat unceremoniously the very ambitious municipal politician.
Now, the CSU leadership is putting all their energy into stabilizing, one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has so far been pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role, with the former head of the regional government and former president of the UHC, designating September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some scathing remarks to the CDU, which he said deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel can only be chancellor again if they somehow get back on their feet, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, difficult to hide her disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not negatively influence the grand coalition of Berlin.
This is relative because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the socio-democrats continues.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - rivals: 110 - 0
No opposition MP has entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday’s elections.
According to Russian observers, this is due to a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due to illegalities committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-person legislature in this country of 10 million has been doing very well in opposition for decades, ahead of yesterday’s elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) had earnestly hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time in dubious elections, would follow in the footsteps of the 2006 constitutional amendment, “allowing for this presence” in parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ renounced its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, economically dependent more and more on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order qualified as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive an entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition.
The fact that the OSCE, during the evaluation of the campaign, emphasized positive changes rather than shortcomings, such as the ban on running for one third of the opposition candidates, referred to prior appeasement.
However, Monday's OSCE statement already challenged the campaign, during which the bulk of opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present when counting votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political detainees have regained their freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU," Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remain so, despite the fact that "the power has been afraid in this parliament which has no weight, to bring in even a single opponent".
The opposition is not planning protests in light of the results, but rather trying to get its message out to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we have to have our opposition newspapers printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the way of broadcasting, but I can also see that they are more and more supporting elections, even in the circle of the elderly" - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, who considers the social security more officially supported.
"Because of the country's debt and the rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery,' is only a matter of time," Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: “People do not believe in words, but in deeds.” In this way, the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had there been revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today, is in force this new measure against the little smarts, against who points and then will drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-lazy novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services," says the minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
“This is reformism,” Brunetta said.
The installation in all the establishments of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of the employees was recorded, assures the secretary general: "it is a process shared by the employees, and we had the collaboration of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissants.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests with a smile, "a good cappuccino at 7 am is an excellent and healthy resolution".
At a conference at the Ecole Supérieure de l'Administration publique
“In three months, the absences of illness of public employees have reduced by 50%, or 60 thousand more workers in a year.”
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more efficient.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister- over the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees, united to challenge the standards of the Brunetta decree using the Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Civil Service is now spreading the data concerning the decrease of absenteeism in the workplace due to illness - writes the association of consumers - the people of "active idlers" continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive employees of the Public Administration, gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of infirmity due to service; the extension of the hours of home tenure of the sick worker, during which the control visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that white deaths were around 1,200.
Figures that show the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To get the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all the Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Accident Victims on Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data released by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, during a message sent to the president of Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Invalid Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "sincere appreciation for the continuous associative effort in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance to the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion"
“Naturally outraged, everyone has struck a fist to put an end to such tragedies that, by their dimension, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are particularly important for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, maintain attention to this phenomenon, do not undervalue the alarm about social gravity, apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed how "this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all institutions, to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The casualty data on the work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent that the number of white deaths is still impressive, "said later the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this 'discount trend' to be translated into a minor attention, because it is precisely when attention relaxes, that tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be achieved through multiple actions."
"In our opinion - has emphasized Mercandelli- more controls and inspections are necessary, as well as a more important intervention on the training of the workers, and this, and this, from the school."
- He added- "There is still a need to make an effort in terms of communication and raising public awareness.
"But above all, there needs to be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the conditions of protection of the compensation provided for the victims of labor" and the "direction of assistance towards which the system is moving in recent years".
“The objective, then, is to give back to the worker the guarantee of insurance,” he added, “so that the fate of the one who has an accident, should not depend on spontaneism or the enlargement of the legislator.”
Mp3 player pointed at, they put at risk the hearing.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent damage to the hearing.
This is what the European Commission announced, which, in a statement released in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unexpected and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific report - we read in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music at full volume using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per day and week, risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume, may unknowingly damage their hearing irreparably,” Kuneva said.
"According to the scientific data - continues the manager Ue - this is a clear risk and we have to react quickly.
What matters most is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public domain.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can keep up with new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"Scientists confirm that there are good reasons for concern, and that the European Commission will now discuss with Member States and other interested parties what measures could possibly be adopted to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The Scientific Committee Ue points out that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the limits currently in force relating to the maximum noise level allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods, risk permanent loss of hearing ability after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to make the Commission leave for the future of the capital.
Today we begin, in March we end, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will finalise the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they have finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and the projects, so as to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - wishes to emphasize Alemanno - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome which can be used by the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Communal Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the will to have a corner where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March, it will have finished its tasks and will then disappear, because this experience must have a precise time duration.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital.
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the management of daily life and emergencies that manifest themselves from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to see forward, and further, towards a deeper foresight, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman city dwellers, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligences who express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "it takes a draft of strategic reference, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city, to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit,".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but that will look further" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital, but "also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to pass for independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.”
Obama is very bold: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!
In reality, these are attacks that don’t say much; they are obviously attacks of a racial nature, and don’t answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an article: Once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will vote for.
This is one aspect of the American mentality that has been kept secret until the end.
“Say what you want, we’ll see ourselves put the cross, on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, so much so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all this reasoning, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89 percent responded: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was kicked back home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's point of weakness.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
Usa, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for suppressions. And many accuse the Internet, this "assassination" of the newspaper.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mind control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to the information attachés, feeling less worried about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to assemble the newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we want traditional journalism as the general public understands it, not to be reduced significantly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and newspaper journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
Locally, the executive group is at 65%.
Publication printed against broadcast.
Journalists don’t have a hard time seeing where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses are making their way to the Internet, perceived by many as the "assassin" of newsprint.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel is increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to getting into the technology hoping it would “do something good” for their journalism.
Today, the biggest hitch in American journalism is between who runs the newsrooms – that is, the directors – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of managers at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to “work safety”.
Managers who think they will lose their job within 3 years, are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we are at 30%.
That of "safe work" at the staff level in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the US, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn $10 thousand a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for the holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, passed a certain number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often “sick” during the year.
It's the climate's fault.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second penal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy under the Unipol-Bnl escalation instruction.
At his trial last week, he was granted house release and turned into a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent travel from the provincial city to a home in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his society and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion bailout approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is indeed the New York Times of yesterday that confirms it communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the world of finance, powerful especially in the states of the Center and the South.
The soul, precisely, which has been despotically felt with the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is only one example of the changes, the big changes that the current economic earthquake is already announcing or letting run: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena that have been hatched for some time, to such an extent that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the double sovereign-state category, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which obviously have close relations with foreign countries, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families who live in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for who governs it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only here national.
Political internationalisation seems to be out of the question, or else it has little to say: the obvious proof is provided by the European Union, which, as usual, cannot decide any common political line between the various interests and between the various national strategies.
And so, it is from the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all an affection for credits: when you go through a difficult period, it is only the states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also possess the necessary means and legitimization to use them: two resources of inestimable value, elements that no market or international organization will ever be able to dispose of in a similar way.
This new emphasis of the nation-state crisis is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-greater importance that more recent economic developments tend to attribute to a factor rather related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized at one stroke that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with the rather unmaterial things like water, crops, oil.
Things which can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but which are absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, foresees a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shade.
And moreover, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even disturbing: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
Thus the conviction of the various classes increases even more, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be always more foreign to the opinions of the majorities.
In short, the demand for leadership, in an underground way, feeds a powerful and branched movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised electoral "revolts" or, alternatively, in the collective mood changes of recent times, from the conservative ascent in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of Labour in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and it could not be by chance that the right-wing victory against Bush).
One gets the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone would say, have more and more difficulty, which is not old today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis reinforces, increases and agitates potentially inordinately.
In view of all this, to speak of a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda, seems frankly exaggerated.
But it is well said, keep your eyes wide open, it is not without reason.
The superglue to walk on the walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centers, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers were able to hold a 100-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from Dayton University, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nano tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests performed on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it “removes easily from the wall,” says Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton’s Faculty of Engineering.
“This material could be used as a temporary adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but the researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nano tubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could include aerospace engineering.
So far, no superheroes.
The other research - The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated, in search of a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, researchers in California presented an adhesive made of hair-like microfibers, which self-cleans dust during movement on an area to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medicines: never with fruit juices.
Pay attention to grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in the summer because they are thirst-quenching and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital drugs, alter the absorption amplifying or decreasing depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether canned or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: it takes just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apples, to reduce the absorption of their beneficial drugs.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized as being responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-terminal and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which had given the news in a two-year-old newsletter, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger deriving from this mix and to pay attention to what you drink, if you take drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the Public University of Milan: "These discoveries are generally, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will have to change the informative notes of the drugs if necessary.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the drugs that one takes, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to address clearly to the doctor or pharmacist ", stressed the expert to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics goes to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote in an article published in the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that unleashed many polemics, and which was reproached to the economist for years, but which has now proved to be accurate.
“I am surprised and even a little shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from public attention,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “high-value economist”, but also a “very aggressive” style whistleblower, particularly critical of the Bush administration’s excesses of liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
This is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to reach ever more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of almost a year, carried out by volunteer developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various new features: from the welcome screen, and the interface revised and become less austere, to other more important, such as the compatibility born for the operating system Apple Mac OS X, and support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files in the graphic elaboration module, keeping the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical graphic of the Adobe format with elements of a spreadsheet or a text maker.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within applications: in the worksheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the elaboration of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for better recognition during the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they are expected to issue the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is in addition to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available for the Linux operating system as usual.
Upon request, the installation CD can be shipped to your home or workplace.
And if the theme of gratuity can be a way to spread it in the homes, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office suite tries the big challenge, can already count on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a service of training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could also open up to prospective business.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing equivalent of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for presentations rival of PowerPoint; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphic module.
Target for 2008, reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity in the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
This is the site of the daily newspaper L'Equipe which reports the news.
At 26 years old, Kohl is the fourth positive rider at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl’s test pieces are among those carried out in recent weeks, by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl’s positivity at the third-generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press, having notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind Carlos Sastre of Spain and Cadel Evans of the United States, winning the polka dot jersey for the best climber.
IMMIGRES: NEW YORK TIMES ASKING IF ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
Would it turn the Beautiful Country into a nation of racists? That's what the New York Times is about. It dedicated a long article debating the theme of racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, a native of Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the “paradox of the north”: the northern regions are both the ones where we record “more integration and more work,” but also “the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the North Lega.”
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
not only.
Even the new legislature wanted by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic stressed this trend: "Giorgio Napolitano, during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Students victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The rental market for students does not have a crisis
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the tenants union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families from origin must support," explains the head of the design office of Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the strong demand from students has distorted the market so much that a process of generalized increase has begun even for the residents.
In most cases, the rental offers also involve a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, no rent limit, sublettings.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of the tax, are necessary to calm the prices.
Reading in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, it goes from 650 euros minimum (zone Bande Nere), to an average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (zone Vittoria)
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas near the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are requested for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euro for a single) for the areas close to the other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
One can only save if one moves away in the peripheral zones: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a single in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar zone.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a single, we spend from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by extra-community students, there is a subsequent anomaly: the rent requested from foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, the cities eliminate the historic halls.
Historic movie theaters close in favor of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centers, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalisation of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of large multi-halls, and the death of mono-hall consumption in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems inevitable and indisputable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places and loaded with memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a bit of a way and so many emotions" observes the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, film that offers Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the juror of Cannes, and which recounted the poetry of a
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of traders, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of traditional type have closed, and it is the cinemas of the main cities that have paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Roman Emilia leads with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The proof that confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is indeed the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but we should still guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room closes in a city, these frequenters are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the failed deliberation of credit in favor of traders: the state’s antecedent debt is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Bologna, the first Italian city concerned about these closures, has decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote single-screen cinemas in historic centres and on the outskirts.
Among the planned regulations, there are tax measures in favor of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the limited traffic area, and will have special rates for parking and in some parking lots.
"This is an initiative that I like", observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures.
It is obvious, however, that to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that for me has always been important: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" that I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, I turn to the other side so as not to see the panels blackened by dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the Town Hall to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
heavy accusations are made by the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, towards the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The controllers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, namesake of the boss, already sentenced for mafia-type criminal association, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all common sense", write the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay for consultations to Master Piromalli.
"Thus the clan would have been granted - write the judges - to enter officially inside the town halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and orientation of the public administration"
The president of the Calabrian regional committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressure of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest.
This morning’s arrests follow those of last July, following which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
By the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still because of alleged conditioning between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been relieved of their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed leader of a center-right coalition, after the tolling of May 2006.
He cried out for scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the vice minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of having planned everything for a political issue, but given the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even managed to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
Starting from the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm write, emerged "the readiness to marry the demands of a businessman, representative of a better known group, close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy is born from the waves, now the big ones launch.
This is an outsized deposit that occupies more than 70% of the surface of the planet and now the major global energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colossuses like Chevron have laid their eyes, and now are trying to get their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give a great boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by sea swell operating systems.
This would be double the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides..
Colossus to attack.
The first company to focus on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it looked like a real revolutionary step.
Two years from now, more and more of these companies that have always been dedicated to traditional energy are focusing on marine energy.
“Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies,” a spokesman for a company associated with the US oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and is evaluating opportunities to cooperate with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a permit deliberated by the US Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that precisely in Alaska, the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which travel the route of energy coming from the sea, and the amounts invested to date, although their details are not known, according to observers, a growing interest.
Tecnology to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology still in its infancy, due to the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create any big problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The wave thrust, which moves the sludge up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure from the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine which in turn feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through submarine cables.
At the moment, we have four such systems in the project phase, waiting for a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already producing power for a shopping mall and parking lot using six subsea turbines from New York’s East River.
The movement of the water during the tides, rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotational movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
Of particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Research of Electric Energy, deserves at the moment, the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on the energy of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look towards the coasts, have invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and previews investments up to 35 million in 2009.
