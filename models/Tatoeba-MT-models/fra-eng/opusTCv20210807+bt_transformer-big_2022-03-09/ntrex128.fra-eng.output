Wales Assembly members concerned about ‘passing for puppets’
Welsh MPs are appalled by a proposal to replace their title with the acronym MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the proposed amendment of the name of the Assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of taunts.
A Labour MP said his group is concerned that the acronym “rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For non-Wales readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crap.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative party would be “open” to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (puppet), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the letter u in English of the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing the legislation introducing the name change, has indicated that “the final decision regarding the naming of the members of the Assembly belongs to the latter”.
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which was widely supported.
On the question of the title of members, the Commission leans in favour of Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a large majority of Welsh prefer MWP.
It seems that members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach consensus could prove to be a real headache for Elin Jones, the Speaker of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a name change bill in the coming weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the name issue during the debate on the bill.
Macedonia: Referendum on changing the name of the country
Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be called the “Republic of North Macedonia.”
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbor, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted that Macedonia's name is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly vetoed its neighbour's membership of the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum, said he would not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in trouble, bells of Saint Martin silenced
“The older people I talked to said that traditionally there was a bar and a church on every street corner,” Adams says.
“There are no more at all today.”
According to him, it is normal that the bars have become scarce.
Today, “we don’t meet in the same way anymore,” he explains.
“We used to go to the bar like our neighbor’s, but that’s no longer the case.”
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will run out long before the officials imagine, and this worries him: "Sooner or later, they will return to square one."
He adds that the churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
“The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will largely be white people who will hasten the closure of all the churches because they are unlikely to become members,” he said.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The original White Methodist congregation abandoned the site in the 1930s.
A black congregation, preaching around, took possession of the building.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by a black community under the leadership of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which blacks struggled to get employed or get promoted.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new chime.
Father Johnson's son and successor in the leadership of St. Martin's Church, the Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the "bells of the poor."
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave it a completely different name: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
She also mentions that this is the first chime in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, sat in front of the larger chime of Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather states that Saint Martin did not replace him.
In recent months, there has been much talk of the stir of architects and entrepreneurs, provoked by the secular elite of the church on one side, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay leaders, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter wanted to impose the costs incurred, even if it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners lamented the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: 13-Year-Old Boy Injured by Shark During Lobster Fishing Game
Authorities say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while fishing for lobster in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, the San Diego TV channel, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and started paddling up to him to get him out of the water.
At first Chad thought that the boy was shouting for joy at having a catch, and then he realized that in reality he had had a catch.
had been bitten.
Arriving near the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the collarbone.
“I was screaming for everyone to get out of the water: There’s a shark!” says Chad.
The boy was evacuated to Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is not known.
At a news conference, rescue chief Larry Giles informed that a shark had been sighted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper torso.
Authorities have closed access to Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's Offensive Plans in the UK Aesthetics Market
Sainsbury's takes care of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and fills them with shelves similar to those of a supermarket, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK’s 2.8 billion-pound aesthetic market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home items are falling, more extensive beauty product shelves will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experiment proves conclusive.
Supermarkets are now investing in the beauty market with the aim of reusing the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would increase the volume of its offerings to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also have more space in areas similar to those of boutiques such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of products not tested on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test dealerships at two stores in Sainsbury's, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second scheduled to open later this year in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket executives need to dig their heads to attract consumers, who are increasingly tending to shop online and head to convenience stores for everyday food products.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said the outlets will increasingly look like department stores, as the supermarket chain tries to counter discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has helped boost sales of consumer goods and profitable acquisitions.
Previous attempts to restructure the UK chain’s pharmaceutical and cosmetics departments had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended following a controversy over the distribution of profits from pharmacies located in supermarkets.
It was after selling its 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, 3 years ago that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role in introducing a wide range of high-end skincare brands to 4 stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of the beauty product shelves has been modified to improve the framework for customers.
“We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer sound advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any need and, thanks to the beautification of our shelves and the ideal location of our establishments, our dominance in the cosmetics market is now unquestionable and changes purchasing habits,” added Mr. Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' anger over Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a $11 million deal
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones's anger over host Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from an $11 million contract tied to her home decor brand, to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to take care of the interior design and accessories brand Truly.
The activity of the two protagonists has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby infuriated Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by retiring from their successful textile and interior design business at the last minute to focus on his new exclusive deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the TV darling revealed, at a meeting that took place under tension at the headquarters of the Dragon's Den star's commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new 1.5 million pound contracts no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their home decor and accessories brand.
The Truly brand was assimilated to actress Gwyneth Paltrow’s, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the host’s fortune to an estimated $11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped on her private jet to join one of her second homes outside of Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was by far one of Holly's top priorities.
and secure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone speechless.
No one could imagine what would happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s headquarters is full of ready-to-sell products.”
Experts believe that the departure of this morning’s host, who is one of Britain’s most “bankable” celebrities, could cause the company to lose millions, due to significant investments in products ranging from cushions or candles, to clothing or interior items, and the risk of a delayed launch.
It could also end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went on vacation together and Peter Jones owns 40% of Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take the role of Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was heated, but in the end we love each other.
Trump has mocked the media for criticizing him for his comment that some deem “unworthy of a president,” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump give up so much?”
He laughed, taking a TV reporter’s voice.
“I gave up nothing at all.”
He said Kim Jong-un was in favour of holding a second meeting, after Trump called the first, which took place in Singapore in June, a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no “corresponding response” from the United States to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
He lamented that, on the contrary, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure exerted.
In his rallying speech Trump offers a much more optimistic outlook.
“Everything is going well with North Korea,” he said.
We have come close to armed conflict.
“Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the remains of North American military personnel returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this crowded arena, there’s barely more than 200 standing in front of me,” he said, pointing to the crowd.
Tsunami: A devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, help from foreign NGOs was supposedly not needed.
More than 10% of the population of Lombok was scattered, but no state of national disaster was declared, a condition required for the triggering of international aid.
“Unfortunately, they have made it clear many times that they don’t want international aid, which complicates things a bit,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children sets up a team to travel to Palu, they still don’t know if fieldwork will be allowed.
Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant tremors, the country desperately lacks the means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Shelters have been set up in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was issued, no alarm siren sounded in Palu, which no doubt contributed to the loss of life.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not easy.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has placed the reform of the run-down infrastructure at the centre of his electoral campaign and has spent considerable sums to rehabilitate roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, has undermined Joko’s government, which is called to stand before voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure due to the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven from their homes, amid clashes on the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge equalizes against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool a Premier League loss to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goals, and his team was led from 1 to 0.
He shot into the ball on his left, before escaping a shot to the second post.
The ball flew above the repair surface before heading to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reached Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended up at the bottom of the cage.
“I was just trying to place myself, grab the ball but players like Shaq are always shooting as far as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw that Kante was approaching to control and without really thinking much I decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward followed a pass in the direction of Mateo Kovacic, before moving to the midfield and sprinting on the Liverpool side.
Kovacic made a quick back and forth in midfield,
and then made a magnificent deep shot that led Hazard into the surface.
Hazard overtook the defence and finished his run in the net of the second post, with a left-footed shot behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Neapolitans in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia: The number of victims of the tsunami rises to 832
The disaster management agency said Sunday morning that the toll of the earthquake and tsunami is 832 dead.
Many residents are trapped under the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that shook the country on Friday and triggered waves 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was dotted with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing woman
A murder investigation was opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead (Merseyside) this morning.
At 7:55 a.m., the 44-year-old woman stabbed to death was found on John Street in Grayson Mews, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police are urging residents of the neighborhood who have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I appeal in particular to the taxi drivers, who could have picked up something on their dashcam and ask them to provide us with any information crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found at a Birkenhead property in which she resided.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman showed up at the scene of the crime and asked questions about where she was found.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have indicated that they are informing the close relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, as police do not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him speechless.
Residents were informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer said the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A tearful woman appeared on the scene,
He said, “It’s too horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were stationed inside the cordon, and another outside.
Several officers were monitoring the building on the inside side of the cordon.
Anyone with any information is asked to send a message to the following address: -MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact Crime Stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, as indicated in the September 30 registry 247.
Parliament: the statue of Cromwell, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the just return, in view of the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural goods of England, committed by its Puritan supporters, like fanatical Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considered Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and called it a "revisionist attempt".
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said: "Given the current debate over the removal of statues, it was clear that Oliver Cromwell's statue in front of the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell neither ordered nor conducted iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
The superb representation of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration one had for him in the nineteenth century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than he is today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, I mean monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognisable figure who represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated.”
China: A pig kills a breeder
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeast China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, his artery severed and covered in blood near a pig farm in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday, with the aim of selling 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the nearby pigsty was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and blood was flowing from his mouth.
A forensic report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg mutilated the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Wu, the breeder’s cousin, said that “his legs were crushed and covered with blood.”
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig responsible for Mr. Yuan's death belonged neither to the breeder nor to his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the animal was locked up to avoid further incidents and allow police to collect evidence.
Mr. Yuan's family and market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, attacks by pigs on people have already been reported.
In 2016, on a farm in Massachusetts, a pig assaulted a woman and her husband, seriously injuring him.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig stuck a Welsh farmer on his tractor before his wife managed to get him away.
In 2012, when an Oregon breeder had just been eaten by his pigs, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that it is not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
“They’re pretty playful animals.
Very curious kids... they have no intention of doing any harm.
You just have to show them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeastern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's northeast coast.
However, Rosa will cause downpours in northeastern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Winds had been blowing at 135 km/h (Category 1 hurricane) since 5 a.m., Eastern Time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and flows eastward to the west coast of the United States, and as it approaches the Baja California Peninsula in the form of a storm on Monday, Hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical humidity northward in the southwestern United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the Southwest over the coming days.
At the local level, precipitation of between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
The showers will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in parts of the southwest, including much of Arizona.
Scattered tropical rains are likely to cause flash floods and rapidly deteriorating conditions.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Intense rain could convert the canyons into raging rivers and thunderstorms will produce gusts of wind and swirls of dust in places.
The approaching depression will give rise to abundant local rains in some southern parts of the country, on the California coast.
Rainfall totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could result in low debris flows and make the shoe slippery.
It could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Scattered tropical showers will reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will fall across the country on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Significant temperature variations are expected for the month of October across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropics will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will suffer considerable temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will attempt to infiltrate and intensify again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm early October, with temperatures hovering around 26 degrees Celsius covering the southern plains and other areas of the northeast.
Mercury could hit 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the season average.
The multi-day forecast indicates that temperatures are expected to be above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh’s trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on 6 television channels on Thursday, the arresting hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were attended by more than 20 million people.
As the political stalemate continues, broadcast services have halted their usual Friday program to announce a theatrical coup: an agreement devised by Jeff Flake, the Arizona Senator, to allow the FBI to investigate the charges for a week.
Before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Christine Ford said she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had touched his person and tried to remove his clothes at a party between high school students.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, said he was also 100% sure it never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial likely reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other channels broadcasting the lawsuit, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen does not always manage to estimate the number of people who watch TV at the office.
For comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football game or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts largely supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, was the most-watched channel on audition day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC was in second place with an audience of 3.26 million.
CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), according to Nielsen.
The interest did not weaken once the hearing was over.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was being played on Friday.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator is being attacked by female protesters as he tried to take the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
Flake looked down for several minutes, while CNN broadcast the sequence of the arrest live.
“Don’t look elsewhere, look at me,” said one of the women.
“Do you really believe he’s telling the truth?
You hold power when so many women are in need.”
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake said his office issued a statement and he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and radio channels covered the live session hours later, as the Judiciary Committee prepared to vote on the procedure to advance Kavanaugh’s appointment by the entire Senate.
Flake said, however, that a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI into the accusations made against the candidate, which minority Democrats demanded.
Flake let himself be partly convinced by talking with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after speaking with Coons and several other senators afterwards.
His choice weighed heavily in the balance, as the Republicans would not have gotten the votes to approve Kavanaugh’s appointment without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh’s sexual assault charges.
Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of doing “small politics”
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her project of leaving the European Union, of doing “small politics” at the expense of Britain’s future and the national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May on the cover, its former foreign minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his so-called Chequers plans, saying that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was “properly ridiculous”.
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of causing death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20, was jailed and charged with second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the scene of the crime, the glasses carried Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to police that he was responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The Baton Rouge Parish Medical Examiner’s Office released a preliminary report on Friday, which determined that the death was caused by a bullet wound that crossed the head and lodged in the neck.
The police service acknowledges the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the forensic laboratory of the state police, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sporting director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their “commitment and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98m for 98kg, the player grew up in Baton-Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “devastated and in shock” after news of Wayde’s passing.
“We fear this kind of event all the time,” Wade lamented.
Mexico City: A volcano spews ashes
Ash escaping from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Reduction recommended Mexicans move away from the volcano, after recording a spike in activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center monitored several rumbles and tremors from the Popocatepetl.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering car windshields in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano located 72 km from the capital, since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, nicknamed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between pro-independence protesters and riot police, as thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being turned away by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder at them, creating clouds of dust in the streets, which usually do not fill up with tourists.
Scuffles also erupted later in the day, while police used batons to contain the clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting “neither forgetfulness nor forgiveness” faced unionist supporters shouting “long life to Spain.”
14 protesters with minor injuries were treated, according to local media.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans in favor of separation, tensions remain sharp in the independence region.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low turnout, with opponents of secession largely boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the area.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday night to block a demonstration in support of the national police.
It still took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was participating with his wife in the separatist protest, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia’s independence.
“We witnessed a great moment last year.
My parents were crying with joy at the thought of being able to vote, but now we are at an impasse,” he said.
Despite their capital victory, albeit slim, in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained pending trial for organizing the referendum and declaring Catalonia’s independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is filming the police support demonstration on her phone, says politicians are responsible for blocking the situation on both sides.
“The tension is only rising,” he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since last year, announced his intention to run for election to the European Parliament next year.
“This is the best way for me to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government,” he added.

The car was also shot by an arrow.
Livingston wins 1-0 against the Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal secures Livingston's win
Recently upgraded, Livingston's team surprised the Rangers with a second victory in 18 games for Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga’s goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt’s team to place second in the standings, tied with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of an away win in the Premiership league this season, and face Sunday the team of the Hearts, which leads by 8 points.
But before then, the Rangers will meet the Rapid of Vienna at the occasion of the Europa League this Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, it extends by 6 games its undefeated career in the division, and its head coach Holt, who replaces Kenny Miller since last month, can boast of not having lost any match yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity against blunt opponents
Holt’s team could have gotten ahead well before scoring, as their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to break through but remained stuck in front of the opposing goal; followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a head pass from Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team let the Rangers own the ball, knowing they could embarrass them through hard-worked tactics.
This is where the decisive goal came in.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and the Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to corner Menga, who took a hit and scored a midfield goal.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves facing an impenetrable defense and goaltender Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half had the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop.
Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor stopped a strike from Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to thwart one of the Livingston's plans.
The Livingston goalie turned down all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were denied by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation against Glenn Middleton and the other for a foul.
The Livingston "phenomenon" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this upward slope.
Their style and team composition have hardly changed since their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for having a motivated team ever since.
which has many great players.
Captain Halkett’s defense was grandiose and beautifully organized, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in suspense for the duration of the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerrard, they have not lived up to their past talent.
They missed one last opportunity and only managed to break through the opposing side once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who end up in the middle of the table.
President Erdogan's mixed welcome in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to improve relations between NATO allies.
Various issues were discussed, such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the largest Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Citing security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to his country.
The cleavage that emerges from the protests reflects this dual vision of Erdogan: a visitor welcomed as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and described as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies following a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 a.m. local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, rescue arrived at the scene, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
London police said officers were making every effort to identify the individual and warn relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus diversions have been put in place. Motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Prison Long Lartin: 6 officers injured during a riot
The head of the high-security men's prison said six prison officers were injured in a riot.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday and is still not under control.
Specialized riot control agents were dispatched to unblock the situation, involving 8 inmates and contained in one wing of the prison.
On the spot, the officers were treated for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison’s management said: “Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons. Those responsible will have to respond to the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences extended.”
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered the most dangerous in the country, are incarcerated in HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the director of the prison was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot control agents were sent to the prison to stop a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked the staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by flash floods (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's likely to happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading into the southwestern desert with what's left of its energy. This region could be hit by flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain forecasting as early as Monday night.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have kept the stage of depression or tropical storm within a 300km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center predict 5-10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm in places in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin are expected to experience 2.5-5 cm of precipitation, with total measurements isolated up to 10 cm.
Rosa’s rains could be life-saving for drought-affected areas that are not exposed to the risk of flash flooding.
Even if the risk of flooding is not to be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial for the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. Drought Surveillance System, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least one extreme category drought, the second most severe category,” reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa begins its journey along the coast on the Baja California Peninsula.
Still of great power Sunday morning and generating winds of up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at the speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and therefore loses its strength.
It is expected to reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane on Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some areas of Mexico, rainfall could be massive and lead to a risk of flooding.
“In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Baja California northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm,” weather.com said.
Rosa will then cross Mexico northward, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and southern Utah in the evening of Tuesday.
“Torrent rains are expected in Baja California, northwest of Sonora and in the southwestern desert and are the main danger,” the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that this precipitation will result in life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted homicide after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 4am local time.
He was sent to the hospital. His condition is currently stable.
Police in Avon and Sommerset said they arrested the four young people (aged 17, 18 and 20) overnight on the Radstock side.
The agents made a call to people who may have filmed the scene with their phones.
Trump says Kavanaugh was a victim of Democrats’ malice and anger
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the merciless and outrageous methods of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump claimed Kavanaugh had been a victim of the malice and anger of Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke to Congress Thursday, dismissing with energy and emotion the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses her of sexually assaulting her several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that “the American people witnessed Kavanaugh’s intelligence and courage” on that day.
“A vote in the direction of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the direction of one of the most accomplished jurists, with a brilliant career in public service,” he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first decisive procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place by Friday, a Republican Party aide told CNN.
Indonesia: Earthquake and tsunami claim hundreds of lives, death toll continues to rise
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had died, most of them washed away by huge waves that hit beaches as an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, hit the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves six meters high flooded the beach at nightfall, taking many lives and destroying everything in their path.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake preceded the tsunami.
“When the tsunami threat came yesterday, everyone was still on the beach, and people didn’t flee immediately, it cost them their lives,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it drove cars, pieces of wood, houses, it took everything with it," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by climbing trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial footage released by the disaster management agency shows destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday’s earthquake was 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she said.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found trapped under the rubble of ruined buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said human and material losses could be greater on the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, a region called Donggala, the closest to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications were “completely paralyzed” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” La Croix Rouge said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“The situation is dramatic and could well get worse,” she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for failing to spread information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officers said the waves had arrived by the time the alert was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man upstairs in a building frantically shouting to passers-by on the street as a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a wall of water fell on the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that cut all communications in Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun to deliver aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport has reopened as part of the rescue operation, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia: The toll of tsunami victims is increasing, there are more than 800 deaths.
It's a tragedy.
World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu, where they found shelter in tarpaulin shelters in the courtyard of their offices, and on the way they discovered scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he says.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to provide relief to those affected, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers had not been allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel can enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
“This disaster is still considered regional,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares this to be a national disaster, international assistance can intervene, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu, relatives of the missing were still hoping for a miracle.
On Saturday, a small boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been buried in the rubble for two days, near her mother’s body.
Indonesian National Paragliding Team coach Gendon Subandono had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Others of his students found themselves trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mandagi added.
“As a former paraglider, I experienced my own dramas,” he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Gendon said he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who were attending the beach festival.
His messages went unanswered.
“I don’t think they’ve ever received my messages.”
In Newport on the Levee, thieves steal $26,750 when charging a vending machine
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was charging a vending machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying a distributor in the entertainment complex and preparing to power it, said inspector Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses reportedly saw many suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities is asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West, who has been calling himself Ye for some time, used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who canceled his visit for "emotional reasons", explained the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation for its current professional nickname, this nickname also has a religious significance for West.
“I think ‘Ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you,’” West explained earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us.
I went from Kanye, which means “the only one,” to Ye – the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.”
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs called himself Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the hyphen and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO declares that it will never use military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, nearly fifty years after bloody law enforcement reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to “never use military force to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire during a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people as student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly stipends to students and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities push young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in artificial intelligence, the United States is expected to double its research funding in this sector, according to investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several U.S. government actors made announcements related to AI, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Double funding for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are one step ahead of the U.S., and we’re looking for the next big discovery in AI,” Lee says.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next key step in AI comes from the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player, then joined the management team of Microsoft Research and became president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee has previously participated in technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get government funding.
“It’s not China that owns the university leaders, it’s the companies,” Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited big academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that changes to immigration policies can also support U.S. AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be automatically granted to AI researchers,” he says.
China’s State Council unveiled its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Sciences Foundation provides funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to involve industry and academy partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
At the same time, the US legislation that is working to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in a referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians made their voices heard in a referendum on changing their country’s name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia’s application to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of whose provinces is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right on its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would affect the ethical identity of Macedonia’s majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about securing a minimum 50 percent turnout required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?”
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to pay to join organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which has survived the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union. This means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which mobilized 66% of registered voters at the end of the election.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko took part in the referendum and voted for the name change, in order to open the vote for membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small stage and has seats in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments. The unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
“I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after tabling his ballot.
He added that a “yes” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published Monday by the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia, between 30 and 43% of voters would intend to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the expected turnout.
Another poll, organized by Macedonian channel Telma, estimated participation at 57%.
70% of those intending to vote said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, it takes 50% of the vote plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
Decisive action: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero fights his way through Brighton’s defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated the Brighton defencemen in Manchester and won the game 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero’s goal, in the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentinian scorer received the ball in the middle of the field, at the start of the action.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, before diving on the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He bypassed one defender before ousting the others close to Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling on his left.
The English forward took the opportunity to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to cheat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot from the right side of the net.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet,” Pep Guardiola, the team’s coach, told reporters.
"We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Skyblues the initial advantage in the Premier League game.
from the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on the Brighton field.
He sent him to the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the second post.
The front of the Skyblues threw the ball into the nets just before sliding off the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the trouble-makers against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off race, there was no reason to get into a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in case of a playoff match for the Rockies, real legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the Western Division of the National League.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to secure their first division title.
“Even if this game doesn’t have a stake, we want to take the field in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and against a team that will probably play at the highest level I’ll have to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a pitcher leaving for Sunday, but would be inclined to leave room for Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, will be in training on Thursday and will launch on his usual day of rest, Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is at 18-7 with an average of 2.53 points earned and 300 withdrawals in 220 steps and two-thirds this season.
Trump's Interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation generated by his support of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court when talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“All of our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It’s a major issue. I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever. That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, really horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“You can see it in the last four days,” he added, before calling Democrats “angry, nasty and lying.”
He referred to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to his being booed by the public.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm expecting one. It was very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the big community it once was.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When activists from the Momentum movement in my local party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a line of Labour MPs who are considered unwelcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she spoke out against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday said, “We want the rally to be inclusive and productive.”
That is exactly what the Friday night general assemblies were like during my eight years as a Labour Party parliamentarian.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case for many rallies and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if ever taken into consideration.
It has become clear that contrary views are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged according to its acceptability by the party leaders.
It started shortly after Jeremy took office, and colleagues with whom I thought I shared the same political vision began to expect me to turn my jacket over and take positions that were contrary to my beliefs, whether it was about national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, there was an abusive tirade on social media, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the center’s policies, telling me that I shouldn’t be a party member.
And that's not just my experience.
Moreover, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me were of a political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a surge of sexist or racist remarks every day, but who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing things about current policy is the normalization of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said Labour should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is narrowing down through motions of no confidence and changes to the rules of selection.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the last couple of years: look down, not express my ideas so loudly, and everything would be fine.
But this is not how I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because the neglect of Thatcher's government had caused my classroom to collapse, and since then I've wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been disturbed by my political positions and my differences with current party officials.
All I’d like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country is moving towards a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and utilities, and I don’t think it’s really time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will stop me from acting for the causes that I defend, which are your interests at all.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remains undefeated
Two late tries may have distorted the final result, but no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense match day of the Scottish Rugby Union Championship.
The team now occupies the top of the standings and becomes the only undefeated team in the championship.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defence and the way they were seized the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate himself on this match.
“So far we’ve been tested, but we’re undefeated, so I have to be happy!” he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, congratulated Ayr: “Bravo to them, they were more effective than us and were able to seize the opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for Scottish wing Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak. Jason Baggot grabbed an untransformed try.
Climo made the situation worse for Ayr with a penalty, before, just at halftime. He scored and turned a solo try to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at break.
Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson’s test, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
A long wait ensued due to a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher. During the recovery, Ayr took the lead again with a try from Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, acting captain of Ayr, was then given a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an untransformed test from Bruce Colvine, which created palpable tension.
But the home team took over and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tagging Climo when he didn’t have the ball, since the penalty touchdown, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr’s maul, who was progressing.
Climo has transformed the test, almost every time since the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong’s box kick and sent winger Gregor Henry off for the team’s fifth home test.
Still Game star embarks on restoration
Still Game star Ford Kieran has decided to pursue a career in food service, and has been named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-hosts with his long-time partner on stage, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the finale of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang era.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s “flourishing restaurant scene.”
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol an armored boat in the La Paz Naval Headquarters.
Public buildings carry a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following bike: “The sea returns to us by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout blocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still present, as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for several decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be delivered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on the big screen throughout the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of the Bolivian request. Bolivia hopes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be required to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the ocean to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president (who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year), also has a lot to say about the decision that will be handed down on Monday.
“We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he said in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favour of Chile, and that little would change, even if a positive decision was made.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the power to grant Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice makes its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case “was not complicated,” says Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from favoring the cause of Bolivia, the last four years have perhaps even harmed it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zarate.
Morales’ bellicose rhetoric undermined all remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that it will be very complicated to hold talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the Court’s decision-making as abnormally fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - who remains to this day one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - was using the maritime problem as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The Court’s decision is an opportunity to see that we have to let go of the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only happen when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's foreign minister, said his country would not give up its nuclear weapons until it had confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to revive deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s current leader.
Ri says it is “chimerical” to think that maintaining sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration that will end the Korean War will bend the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of any meaningful prior disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang’s seriousness in renouncing an arsenal that the country considers as the only guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in headwear, perhaps soon available in your stores
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun 100%, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of oversize hats at a PE19 fashion show that honored the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Hats all more extravagant than each other have invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators have decided to integrate their delirious pieces in the parades.
Valentino's flagship piece was an eccentric beige hat adorned with a broad feather-like edge, which engulfed the heads of mannequins.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons adorned with jewelry, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple. But these pieces were not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had sewn lips and evoked more Hannibal Lecter than Haute Couture.
One design looked like diving gear, with snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a cone of melted ice.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you’re in luck.
According to style observers, the imposing hats could come up to your shopping streets.
XXL hats follow in the wake of the “Bomba”, the wide-brimmed straw hat that stars tear apart, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this hard-wearing hat that flooded social networks presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in a swimsuit who wore it.
The burnt orange rafia bag, adorned with rafia fringes and a handful of white leather, was the centerpiece of Jacquemus’s PE19 La Riviera fashion show during Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big beach hats and bags coming into stores next summer. The designer has made such an impact that it's clear there will be demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with excellent new exam results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the highest level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector able to design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart.”
It reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and build trust with people in other countries.
If we look at the excellent exam results this year, we see that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade, A.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, shows that 72% of students achieved the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as did 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that Scotland’s independent schools support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
From now on, languages as subjects are organized just like science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other schools.
A UK Employment and Skills Commission survey conducted in 2014 found that among the difficulties employers face in recruiting candidates, 17% are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of career choice, a person who speaks a second language will have a real advantage in the future thanks to this long-lasting skill.
Being able to communicate directly with strangers will automatically put the multilingual person ahead of their competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults living in the United Kingdom, 75% of them did not have sufficient command of a foreign language to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking multiple languages, especially those in emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Many will focus on contemporary classical languages, while others will teach languages considered important to the UK in the run-up to 2020, including Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child’s preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to offer a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It is clear that, in today's global business environment, languages remain of paramount importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his Los Angeles Lakers debut.
Luke Walton, the Lakers' coach, announced that James will play Sunday in the pre-season opening against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
“More than one, less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a limited few minutes.
After training, earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to be ready.”
Trump campaign in West Virginia (YouTube channel)
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stops, including in states like Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
With the vote to confirm the Supreme Court vacancy postponed, Trump is seeking support for the upcoming midterm elections and preventing Republicans from losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the issue of the hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week, and Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote in the Senate is expected to be postponed for up to a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is primarily aimed at helping Republicans gain ground in the run-up to the November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American president said in his campaign that the five rallies were meant to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and extend the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control of Congress is such an essential part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible at this busy start to the election campaign,” a Trump team spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight’s rally, scheduled at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, could bring together supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and grab the attention of Pittsburgh media.”
On Saturday, it will be Trump’s second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to come in to try and get him back in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA ready to fight for hope ahead of Sunday’s singles
After three singles, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes may well represent what was missing at this Ryder Cup.
The swing of momentum is a sport concept invented from scratch but which players sincerely believe, and more than ever at tournaments such as this one.
Where would they put the momentum now?
“They were leading six points and now four, so we’re getting a little bit of wings,” Spieth said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, have the feeling of having a little wind in their sails and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and can boast of having each obtained three points out of four.
Spieth has been terribly effective from tee to green and sets an example.
The energetic shouts of joy intensified as his game progressed, and a crucial putt allowed him to equalize in the fourth game as he and Thomas were led two down after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the game on the 15th hole, raised a similar cry, from those who tell you that he believes the American team still in the running.
“You really have to stay determined and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for each of these players now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as evidenced by the history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four out of four matches and is not entitled to error.
Not only were “Moliwood” the only ones not to make a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to flow between them and the delirious crowd designates them as the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to delight in a potential European victory as the sun sets over the National Golf.
Preferably, both at the same time at different holes.
But talking about European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat fourball hero Sergio Garcia as he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they could never come out.
On Sunday, no one is there to help you.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between pairs, the tips they give and the ones they don’t give, and how a strategy can tip over in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a considerable lead during the last day, but this session of foursomes also proved that the Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially at home.
Europe leads 10-6 on final day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enjoy a strong advantage in the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 over the United States in Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a distressed Tiger Woods, allowing them to score four points so far.
Determined to retain the title she lost at Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn’s European team made the difference by winning 3-1 in the morning fourballs against a messy American team.
The United States demonstrated greater resistance in the foursomes and won two victories, but failed to close the gap.
Jim Furyk’s men must score eight points out of 12 Sunday in the singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while Molinari and he, dubbed "Molliwood" after a smashing weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed during the fourballs, they beat the pair composed of the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired by a 5 and a 4 even more categorical.
Woods, who dragged himself through Saturday's two games, shone a few times, but has now lost 19 of his 29 fourball and foursome games, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning fourballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively number one and three in the world rankings.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the south-west of Paris, in a cool but clear weather.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 win over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, as they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, one team recovered from a four-point gap in singles, although Furyk's team, which held the crown, only had to draw to retain its trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they may not recover from a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says disarmament can never be done unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, the North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations that maintaining the sanctions reinforced his mistrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
At the world body's annual general meeting, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea had taken "important steps of good will" last year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we see no corresponding response from the United States," he said.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, in such circumstances, we cannot be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
While reiterating North Korea’s well-known criticism of Washington’s opposition to a “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it gradually took action, its statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump on June 12 in Singapore at the first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work towards a “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused demands to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
The U.S. insists that North Korea first proceed with denuclearization and step up pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive manner, even opposing the “end-of-war declaration.”
“Those who think that these sanctions can make us pander do not know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our mistrust.”
Ri did not comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, and added: “If the part concerned with the denuclearization issue was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a deadlock.”
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles at North American territory after the “evil” President Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened last year at the United Nations to “totally destroy” North Korea, has been praised this year for the courage with which Kim has applied measures towards disarmament, but added that there is still much to be done and that sanctions will not be lifted until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said no deadline had been set: “It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn’t matter,” he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council last Thursday that “the implementation of Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until denuclearization is complete, final and verified.”
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to stifle funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang claiming that progress had been made, but in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced its “gangster methods.”
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the U.S. took “equivalent steps.”
According to the South Korean president, Kim is demanding the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students Take Rest Classes
This year, Harvard University introduced a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and combats the growing macho trend of studying by consuming caffeine all night long.
A professor has noticed that most students at the best university in the world do not know how to take care of them
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him.
In the end, a student approached me and said, “Why am I told this only in the last year?”
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
Delivered for the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their academic and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general manager of the university's health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The class time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know it won’t instantly change student behavior.
However, in our opinion, they have the right to know this information – in the same way that you have the right to know what the health effects of smoking are,” added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the pride culture of “getting a sleepless night” still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students make lack of sleep a growing problem.
Having enough and good quality sleep should be students’ “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even to avoid gaining weight, as lack of sleep puts the brain into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemistry and physical biology student, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and pushed him to insist that it be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all postgraduate students a similar degree program before joining the reputable institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm for both bedtime and wake time, and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and lead to sleep disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's men down
The Rangers suffered another hard blow away, with Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to Livingston to a 1-0 loss.
The Ibrox team was hoping to record their first on-the-go win since winning 4-1 in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team adrift, eight points behind the Ladbroke Premiership leaders.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston is in third, just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, referee Calum Spence having had to be treated for a head injury following the throwing of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, meanwhile, picked the same Livi 11 who snatched a point from the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team suffocating his opponents every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered possession of the ball, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored at two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then fired a powerful shot at captain Craig Halkett, but teammate defenseman Alan Lithgow was only able to reach the second post.
The Rangers managed to gain control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have had a penalty after the free-kick when he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian’s demands.
The Rangers took only two shots in the first period, but former Ibrox goalie Liam Kelly was barely troubled by Lassana Coulibaly and a strike from Ovie Ejaria.
If the opening of the score by Livi in the 34th minute was against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it because of their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed Jacobs’s arrested kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to choose Menga for an end in simplicity.
Gerrard reacted at halftime by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost had an immediate impact when the winger appeared in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston still kept pushing visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls over long balls.
Holt’s team could have taken the lead in the final moments, but McGregor did well to push Jacobs back before Lithgow missed the goal.
Rangers alternate Glenn Middleton once again claimed a late-game penalty while battling Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Almanac "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOURNE ACCOUNTEUR... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that later gave rise to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado,” starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: “What is this?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, it's used to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
Thanks to these headphones, one can really hear the effects of atoms released into the minerals by radioactivity.”
Evans: “Say, it’s sure to jump right now!”
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
New cancer vaccine allows immune system to ‘detect’ cancer cells
New cancer vaccine allows immune system to ‘detect’ cancer cells and kill them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then “detect” a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory, so that they can detect the HER2 protein common to many cancers, and finally to re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein “causes an increase in several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, which involves taking immune cells to “teach” them how to target cancer cells, has been proven in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Dressed in a MAGA cap, Kanye West embarked on a Pro-Trump rant after his stint at SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was booed on set after a raging performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump on a Saturday Night Live and announced that he would run for office in 2020.
After his third song, Ghost Town, which he sang wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West took on the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“A lot of times I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump?
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's diatribe was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don’t know if Rock intended to make fun of West with this post.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that hat on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I’m in a pit,” he says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see him, the chasm?" and said he would wear his Superman cape, because no one can dictate his actions.
Try love.”
His comments attracted booing at least twice from the public and the SNL members seemed embarrassed, Variety reports. One person on the spot told the magazine: "A deathly silence fell on the entire set."
West had been called in to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West has unsettled many people by singing the song I Love It in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR HAVING HEAD TO THE FOUL.”
But Karen Hunter, the show's host, tweeted that West was simply "faithful to himself, and that's absolutely wonderful."
“However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying their music, clothing, or supporting their art) who, in my opinion, embraces and pours out an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg bore the name Snoop Lion and of course the legendary late Prince, who changed his name to symbol, then that of the artist previously known as Prince.
Belfast charged with attempted murder after stabbing attack at restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday at a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series.
But the 31-year-old actor took on the macho hero stereotype, claiming that this type of role on screen often causes young boys to pose as tough to cook to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something is wrong” and addresses the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of the “MeToo.”
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, said he was “strongly” committed to tackling the issue.
“Personally, I deeply believe that we have abused masculinity.”
“What teachings have we given to young men who become adults, in relation to the problem that now arises?”
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity because of its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What behavior is innate, what behavior has been inculcated?
What does television and the street teach young boys who make them think they have to behave this way to be a man?
I think that’s really one of the fundamental questions of our time – how can we change that?
There is obviously something wrong.”
In the interview, he also confessed that he would not be making prologues or sequels when the series ends next summer, saying he was done with “the battlefields and the horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will star in a cover of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so she gave me my future family and my life from now on,” he says.
Rose played Ygritte, Kit's lover Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, at Leslie’s family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients have been infected during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly to parts of the country following transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been virtually reduced to zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference held in Yunnan province.
However, year-over-year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
In China’s LGBT community, HIV transmission through sex is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of gay men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee leaked data about the senators, and denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages dedicated to lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were backed by experts and “far-right” websites.
“Lies, lies, and more infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It appears the leaked information included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by a stranger on Capitol Hill during the Senate sitting about allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to the Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with Waters’ office and leaked information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
“The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for leaking this information.”
“This false allegation is completely false and a real lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary.
“This denial is anger,” he wrote.
“This indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something they did not do, they should not be angry.
It must not be provocative.
It must not call into question the reasons of the accuser.
She must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters in the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s huge,” he wrote on Twitter.
In its statement, Waters said its office had alerted “the relevant law enforcement authorities and services” about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the culprits are unmasked,” she added, “and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team.”
Johnny English has hit again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, undergirded spy
It has now become a tradition to seek the reach of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satirage on the issue of the evidence of our insignificance represent our country’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his wide-eyed and rubber face, saw his license renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicating above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking film-loving audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts as a glamorous charmer, has a little Clouseau, a hint of Mr Bean and a good dose of the guy who runs a small note in Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, he was also inspired by the international traveler and mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
The last Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English getting close to a helicopter while he was wearing medieval armor and the rotor blades were briefly hitting his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, though the humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves confidently compose with comedy.
The humor seems more child-oriented than adult-oriented and, for me, Johnny English’s wacky misadventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson’s silent film gags in the Bean character.
The perennially topical premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, much to the dismay of operatives on duty – a role unfortunately of small scope for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the gout that’s spilling over for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the brink of crisis and is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there’s not much left to get behind in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, so she will have to take someone out of retirement.
This means disturbing Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a posh establishment as a schoolmaster, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: some nice pranks here, because English offers a Rock Academy-style spy academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, her former long-term partner, again encamped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a funny hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little squandered.
So Batman and Robin, who are in trouble at Her Majesty's Secret Service, go back to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the sway of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of far-fetched jokes: under the guise of waiters, they set a French restaurant on fire; they create chaos by sneaking on Volta's luxurious sailboat; and English sets off a veritable anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality headset, to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are guaranteed for this last sequence, but despite everything, there is a lot for the children in all this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn’t help but think, as with Johnny English’s other films: can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will truly value his talent?
Labour denies it has a plan for Britons to work four days but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party needs to consider a radical plan that will allow Britons to work four days a week – but be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while continuing to receive the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic program and plans to steer the country in favour of workers.
The move to a four-day week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of economic changes.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.”
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers as well as its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party pledged a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day workweek is not a policy of the party and is not contemplated by the party.”
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to give details of his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "anonymous administrators" and "profiteers" in utility companies.
The deputy chancellor’s plans also provide that current shareholders of the water companies may not recover their entire stake since the Labour government could make “deductions” due to alleged misbehavior.
It also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into corporate boards, as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, who will pocket up to $500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The final vote on the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court has been postponed by at least a week following the FBI's investigation into the charges against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the 60 Minutes correspondent, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Obviously,” Kennedy said.
"On my way to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, “Did you do that?”
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be etched in stone.
“I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an explosive charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people she appoints couldn’t verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I don’t see anything new that changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission: to end global poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn to not only enjoy performances by artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the festival’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which first took place in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to complete a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, emailing a global leader, calling, or making any other useful effort to raise awareness of the fight against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining 12 years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really persuade them to demand a call to action, or is it just another example of “clictivism” – a situation in which people really think they can make a difference by signing a petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped inspire world leaders to make commitments and adopt policies amounting to more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which a tranche of at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers who are committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” while promising Rwanda a 35 million pound aid package to end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition program, told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following the company’s more than 5,000 actions to ask the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, “What makes you think it’s possible to end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen said: “The road to getting there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monèe are among the artists who will perform this year in New York, where Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
U.S. could call on Navy to create ‘blockade’ to hinder Russian energy exports
In order to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can “if necessary” call on the US Navy, revealed Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s presence in Syria – especially where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government – is a pretext for it to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East in order to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern center of Europe,” he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to address this.
“The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not put on the market,” he added.
Zinke spoke to attendees at the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the “spokesperson for energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually identical.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia as having “more than one rope to its bow” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has pledged to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says makes Berlin “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s staunch opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a September speech in Moscow following a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Energy Secretary, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said, “I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.”
The position of the United States has provoked negative reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to get involved in European energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to seriously consider running in 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider running for president following the midterm elections.
At a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren said she thought of President Donald Trump at the public rally, saying he was “driving this country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was forthright in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Obviously we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters are not of the opinion that she should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Center for Policy Research and the Boston Globe, 58 percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The poll found that former Gov. Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favor of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names raised for a potential 2020 campaign include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin discusses Track Palin’s PTSD during Donald Trump’s rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in connection with an incident of domestic violence.
“What my own son is feeling right now, what he is feeling coming home, I can connect him with other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the audience at the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "taboo subject" and said of his son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if we respect what their comrades and members of the air force, and every other member of the military, have given to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of an intoxicated weapon.
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favor of a legal challenge to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favor of a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a brief in favor of an asylum seeker who was challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and his sons, members of violent gangs,” had assaulted her, but U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate large numbers of asylum claims in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney for the District of Columbia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law states that all asylum claims must be reviewed based on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban violates this principle,” the amicus curiae said in its brief.
The lawyers also argued in the brief that the policy of denying entry to immigrants hurts the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to people who leave their country of origin due to persecution or fear on the grounds of race, creed, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sessions said in its announcement of the policy on June 11.
"Asylum was never designed to alleviate all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people face every day around the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more dramatic.
“I feel very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her feverish little boy in Palu, at an evacuation center in the emptied city.
“At every moment, an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is rare.”
Residents were seen going to their destroyed homes, picking up soggy goods and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were submerged.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fractured back and shoulders, rested in front of the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to persistent strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted how he felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but after the silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade in a U.S. newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. parliamentary elections, an accusation that China refutes.
In accusing Beijing of wanting to interfere in the U.S. election, Trump marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the start of the trade war, China’s tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters from states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is doubling down on its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of free speech and freedom of the press by inserting a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad writes.
“On the other hand, at the Beijing press office, you will find few dissenting voices and will not see the true reflection of the differing views that the Chinese may have on China’s troubling economic trajectory, because the media are firmly obedient to the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating female voters ahead of midterm elections due to Kavanaugh debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee amid allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments surrounding this case have been extremely keen, and most Republicans have already shown publicly that they want the vote to take place.
In a September 29 article in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, said "you can't go back."
Reeher added that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake’s (R-Ariz.) last-minute efforts in favor of an FBI investigation would be enough to calm voters’ anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, “women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November,” she said on September 28, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, protesters chanted “November is coming!” in the Senate hallway as Republicans governing the Judiciary Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be disproportionate,” said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But that could be even higher, especially among suburban voters and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who, even if they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public deposition detailing the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested the reaction could be strong if Republicans advanced the confirmation.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said early last week that “It’s become a messy mess for the GOP.”
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote, it’s not about Kavanaugh’s nomination, it’s about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they handled it,” said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats.
As a result of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, however, the Americans appear to be divided over the credibility of both sides, with a small majority leaning toward Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov poll found that 41 percent of those consulted believed Ford’s testimony absolutely or probably, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was intoxicated at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court candidate allegedly showed him his genitals during a party.
World Wide Web Inventor Considers Launching New Internet to Challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s free platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is saved as well as who is allowed to access such and such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt was aiming to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the launch.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or DPL.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available at the same time on a single browser.
The peculiarity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this “personal responsibility via data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company brings the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few developers working on contract on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not yet in discussions with “Facebook and Google” about whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely messed up in an instant.
“We’re not asking them for permission.”
In an article on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “[Inrupt’s] mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a First World War clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was, however, killed by a sniper four days later and was unaware that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons unveiled a commemorative stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was “brilliantly symbolic” to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s exploit.
According to the London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal “through a very thick fog and under the violent fire of field guns and machine guns.”
Later, he rushed to the firing line and, with "greatest bravery," guided the line before blowing up a field cannon on his own and knocking out three soldiers from the detachment.
On 4 October 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant-Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “a thing I’ll never be at, but one that humbles me.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band-led parade.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people."
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206. Instead, they got Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent the whole night watching a well-stocked Bellator 206, but you couldn’t see the main event.
In San Jose, the event had 13 fights, six of them on the main page, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK, on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy that they stayed awake until the early hours of the morning especially for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the move to children’s cartoons as “a kind of bad joke.”
Regarding the transmission, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said that “the government regulation states that at 6 a.m., this content was not suitable, so they had to switch to children’s shows.”
“Peppa the pig,” yes.
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator, said they would work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about the replay, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“However, it is six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution until Sunday our time, which is Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program switched, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren’t all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t a problem, it was a government issue.
I can guarantee it won't happen next time.
We’ll limit ourselves to five fights instead of six – as we usually do – and we’ve tried to give more for the fans and we’ve ruined everything.
This is a regrettable situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “inferior” in terms of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality – but that instilled in him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that “not everyone [was] like me.”
On the first show of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the issue of gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The show's usual presenter, Kirsty Young, took several months off because of her illness.
Appearing as a castaway on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" every other child growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, “Even today, those feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was “something,” he continued.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist is now a prominent LGBT activist and has taken advantage of his participation this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and so he wanted to give back “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion claimed he "didn't expect" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013
Daley last year married the Oscar winner, 20 years his senior, but he said age difference had never been a problem.
"When you see so many things at such a young age" - he took part in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find a person of the same age having experienced the same ups and downs.
In June, they became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "his whole outlook" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, I was just thinking about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012, since he wanted to be sitting in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I was holding him by the hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and he died before I finally recognized that he was not invincible,” he added.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“That was all I’d dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there’s nothing better,” he said.
In addition, it inspired his first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - which had accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and always gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 a.m., BST.
An out-of-shape Mickelson on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday playing his 47th game of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to recover to avoid it being an unfortunate stage.
Mickelson, who was competing in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was ruled out by captain Jim Furyk of Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the five-time great champion has divided his day between the role of supporter and the refinement of his game at the stand in order to remedy his ailments.
He has never been the greatest of the leaders, even at the peak of his career. At 48, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough systematically punishes misguided shots.
And as if the course wasn’t formidable enough in itself, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faced British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, four down at the start of the 12 singles games, make a good start, Mickelson’s game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn't say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a pat on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in him.
He’s a legendary champion and he’s added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn’t see him play two games.
I was planning more, but that's how it happened and that's how we felt we had to go.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves to his credit, although Furyk said his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun competing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He does more than just play.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows the lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before the singles of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful course.
The Dane played his first game in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros was five points ahead of the Americans, but eventually rose to the top of the standings with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, winning 141-2-131-2.
“You keep remembering that we were leading a lot in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won, but narrowly,” said Bjorn, after watching the 2018 Ranking win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and to all members of this team that this is not the end.
Go ahead tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have a goal, which is to try and win this trophy, and that’s where we have to stay focused.
I’ve always said I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re very aware of what’s happening on the other side – they’re the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on a challenging golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never step forward on this.
Tomorrow is a completely different pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it is the individual performances that will be presented and it is quite different.
It’s fantastic to be with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re out there on your own, you’re put to the test to the fullest of your ability as a golfer.
That’s the message to the players, is to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he has to get the best out of himself, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players get better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced both ends of these last day’s turnarounds, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing at the end of the “Miracle of Medinah”, where Europe snatched the win.
“I remember every word,” he says in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had made it to rally his players on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to take that quick start like you saw in Brookline, like you saw in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in a direction, puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we had to, we’re trying to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
“I’ve accompanied this group of guys in that order because I think it covers the whole course,” Bjorn said of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship postponed again
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging warships dating from the Cold War, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential expenses.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the flagship of the all-new frigates of Baden-Wuerttemberg, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but worrying post-delivery issues have jeopardized the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wurttemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as a radar, infrared and reduced acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside the home ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the incessant delays mean that forward-thinking warships – which should allow Germany to project its force overseas – will already be obsolete when put into service.
Last year, the cursed F125 frigate made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after it was delivered.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of “software and hardware flaws” that rendered the warship useless in case of deployment on a combat mission.
The software failures were particularly significant as the Baden-Wurttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the vessel is significantly overloaded, which decreases its performance and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Beyond computer system failures, the price of the project as a whole – including crew training – is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), against 2.2 billion initially.
The problems associated with the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval force is diminishing.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is in fact “short of ships that can deploy.”
The official said the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were decommissioned but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust Monitors the Secret Life of Bats
New research in an area of the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The National Trust for Scotland researchers’ study will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at Inverewe Garden, Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using hand-held detectors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of bat cries and the activities of the different species.
A habitat map and report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of grasslands and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the perches and leads to the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly-papers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to capturing prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to spot insects and obstacles on their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, perch inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave site in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Domain manager David Thompson says the site is the perfect territory for them.
“Here at Threave, we have a great place for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right habitat.
But there’s still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we’re doing here and in other places will help us better understand what bats need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before maintaining the properties, because by unintentionally destroying a single maternity nest, it can cause the death of 400 females and small, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or destroy their perches.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and when it comes to many of our species, we don’t know what’s going on in their populations right now.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him “false information,” and claimed that people “want to make themselves known” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel said last Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, called the information “false information.”
“No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They want to advertise using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they described as “unacceptable accusations of suspicion in the field of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the hotel-casino Le Palms, in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where anal rape allegedly occurred, according to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and assured him that he was a “good guy” at “99%” but that he didn’t know what was going on with the remaining “1%”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that these were consensual.
Mayorga also said she went to police and that photos of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an amicable settlement because she felt “terrified of reprisals” and feared “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to cancel the settlement because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged assault, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve under a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The UK would “forever regret” the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the UK's trade secretary, "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as a global leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby, if Britain withdrew from the EU without a deal.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which makes Toyota’s Auris and Avensis vehicles – built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s director at Burnaston.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what automakers are calling supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated in “tense flow,” with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom-built vehicles.
If on March 29, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there could be disruptions at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be halted.
According to Clark, Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
“We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I said, not only to take advantage of the current success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he told the BBC’s Radio 4’s Today.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to maintain what has proven to be an excellent set of supply chains.”
While Toyota has not been able to specify how long production will be halted, it warned that in the longer term, the additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and end up costing jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the union’s factory coordinator who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, said its members are increasingly worried: “In my experience, once these jobs go away, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
White House says Trump and Rosenstein meeting could still be delayed
According to the White House announcement on Sunday, the meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “repeated by a week,” while the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser charged with investigating Russian interference in the elections, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and possible obstructions to justice by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will fire the assistant attorney general, and thus endanger Mueller’s independence, has been fueling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about wearing a microphone in order to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday, he ran for the White House, as he was about to step down.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he “would rather not” dismiss Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we postpone another week given all the other things that are happening at the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I like to keep the press informed.”
The claim would be disputed by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conferences at the White House.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rarity of the lectures was not due to an aversion to “demagogic” TV reporters, although she said, “I have nothing against them amazing the gallery.”
Then she hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without citing any evidence, she added that “the president participates in more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him”: “We checked the numbers.”
Press conferences will always take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the chance to directly question the President of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do it frequently, you’ve seen it well in recent weeks, and it’s going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States.”
On a regular basis, Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare that he does press conferences solo.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and at times a bizarre appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
On Brexit fears, Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Health Secretary wrote to EU officials working in the Scottish NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter within less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of status applications for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, withdrawal negotiations continued between the UK and the EU and are expected to result in decisions this fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a no deal.
I understand that this period must be very troubling for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is quite your home and we really want you to stay here.”
After suffering a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
According to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, Texas Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury Saturday in the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27 loss.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the state of Tennessee, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He got to the sidelines and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for another exam.
A representative from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room of the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said there were "no details yet as to the type or extent of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a student athlete in his second year, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before coming out of the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duties if they buy a property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new conservative schemes
This measure will undo the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
Stamp duty increase will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy a property in the UK – the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract younger voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will be used to bolster the government’s efforts in the fight to help the homeless.
This surcharge - in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and lease purchases - could be as high as 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13% of London’s new buildings are bought by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and prevents first-time buyers from finding a place in the housing market.
Many of the country’s rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers who mostly stay outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing large construction companies of keeping property prices high by grabbing land without using it, he urged May to drop quotas on affordable housing in an effort to settle the "real estate disgrace" in the UK.
Corbyn presented an attractive package of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and the removal of “no-fault” evictions.
He also wants to give the councils more powers to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my position as prime minister to the renaissance of the British dream – that every new generation will have a better life.
To do this, we need to fix our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
It is, however, unfair that it is as easy for individuals who do not reside in the UK, as it is for foreign companies, to buy a home as it is for hard-working British residents.
For far too many people, the dream of access to property has become remote and the misery of the homeless remains too real.”
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland technician Jack Ross says his “ultimate ambition” is to become the Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot takes pleasure in taking up the challenge of reviving the North East club, which currently occupies third place in Ligue 1, three points behind the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland’s Hampden games with my dad and that’s something I’ve never forgotten.
This opportunity would only present itself if I succeeded in the management of the club.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland's selectors were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic technician says he has not hesitated to line up behind such iconic names in such a big club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question ‘can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Due to the structure and infrastructure of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he added.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I probably wouldn’t consider myself a success here unless I manage to bring the club back there.”
Ross has only three years as a coach, after a stint as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from a third-division relegation and turned St Mirren, who was on the verge of relegation, into a great championship winner the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Alloa’s care “was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls.
“I really thought being a coach was better for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did well, made a good living, and enjoyed some nice highs.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of details to be worked out every week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is fine with me.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I do, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I’ve been in my entire adult life.”

According to a survey, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The heat of summer has boosted the income of struggling British pubs, but has added to the pressure on restaurant chains.
Figures indicate that bar and pub groups recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the consulting firm CGA, which compiled the data, said: “England’s continued sunshine and longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed the June model, where bars had risen 2.8%, except for restaurants, which suffered an even bigger shock.
The 1.8% drop in the restaurant sector in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are by far the most popular, with more points of resemblance than restaurants that decline.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurateurs.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%.”
Paul Newman, RSM Leisure and Hospitality Analyst, said: “These results follow the trend observed since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It’s no wonder foodservice groups continue to struggle, though a 4.8% annual average sales decline is particularly painful, in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have been less timely for food business operators and the weather will tell us if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will give a well-deserved respite.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in implementation.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined revenue of over 9 billion pounds sterling and is the standard in the established industry.
On social media, one in five children has secret accounts that he hides from his parents
According to a survey, one in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in fake Insta pages
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students reported having a “main” account to show their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – open an account on social media that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a rapid growth of “fake Insta accounts” – a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported running a cleaned “main” account to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site discovered a teenager who was inciting others to “rape me.”
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 have a double profile, with half of students admitting to having private accounts.
CSM Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teens are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described the choice as a great opportunity for the sport’s leaders to build on his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has tremendous respect within the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would benefit tremendously from her participation on the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 1996 200-metre and 400-metre events at the Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said only time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It was a trying job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
Online, a breast pump ad that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertisement from a company offering a breast pump compares nursing mothers to cows when milking.
To mark the launch of what’s called “the world’s first silent breast pump,” Elvie, a consumer technology company, has launched a bold music video-inspired ad to show the freedom its new breast pump offers breastfeeding women.
In a cow barn filled with hay, four real mothers dance to the rhythm of a song whose lyrics are: “Yes, I’m weaving myself, but you don’t see a tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed, these are my breasts, not breasts.”
The chorus continues: “Pump it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help the women milking the milk.”
However, the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received conflicting reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a poor decision to use cows to promote this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them within days of their birth,” one of them wrote.

Another commented: “It’s an understandable trauma for both the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are babysitting?”
Someone else added: “An advertisement so disconnected.”
Others defended the ad, such as a woman admitting that she found the song "hilarious".
“I think it’s a genius idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented, “It’s a fun ad for moms who get their milk (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like ‘cows.’
It’s not an ad that praises the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they danced with the discreet breast pumps hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump is completely silent, without wires or hoses and discreetly inserts into a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even get out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother commented: “The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to emphasize the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new breast pump will provide.
This is not the first time the Elvie breast pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway of designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Settle in Silence at Texas Border Camp
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies have made it difficult for respondents to place children in care.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves undocumented immigrants, and they feared compromising their own ability to stay in the country by rescuing a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their households should submit their fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no judicial history.
“Nearly 80 per cent of respondents or their families are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people,” said Albence.
According to shelter workers, in order to deal more quickly with children, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to argue their case regarding their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible will be promptly deported.
According to the speakers and reports that have been presented in recent months by the shelter network, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to bursts of violence or attempts to escape.
In a large facility like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs that a child is in trouble are more likely to be overlooked because of his or her size, according to child rights advocates.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could exacerbate a trauma that many struggle to cope with.
Syria is asking the US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they “would be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem argued that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, as more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged” from both terrorist groups as well as from any “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-ravaged country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on site.
Moualem said the conditions were favourable for refugees to return, and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational concerns” that have deterred refugees from returning.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure that these returns are facilitated,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have indicated that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war is reached.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for the creation of a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has helped advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal has avoided a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Russian-backed Syrian forces.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement provides for “specific timelines” and expressed hope that military measures will target jihadists, especially Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to al-Qaeda and who “will be eliminated.”
Staffan de Mistura, the UN representative, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the group’s work should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution,” and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, impeachment and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
Which would probably be “The most spectacular final of a presidency!”
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and have nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show,” which reaches 3.5 million viewers at the big parties, is the premier cable television channel.
“It’s a case that attracts people because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama series Designated Survivor, which talks about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comic writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And Some Irrefutable Truths About Getting Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Ms. Scovell told me.
Chaos has a playful value.
Obviously, unlike anything that happens on television, Washington’s scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can come together and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the wealthiest viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself watching for six hours a panel of experts debate how Bob Woodward used “deep know-how” for his book “Fear,” about Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a proud garment” according to the Washington Post) and the consequences of Mr. Storm’s extravagant descriptions of it.
I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
“If part of what he’s doing feels like seeing a reality show, it’s because he’s making you swallow something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, general manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s changing teams and day-to-day turn-arounds (to fight with the NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode or we're lagging behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees at home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was holed up inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't stand out, not with Brett Kavanaugh as he prepared to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Outside money invades the tightest midterm elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district is flooded with money, thanks to a readjustment of congressional ridings that allowed two incumbents to compete for the same seat.
This recently restructured suburban Pittsburgh district is home to Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another riding in the special election last spring.
Lamb competes with another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which heavily straddles the new 17th District.
The maps were redesigned when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former boroughs were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district kicked off a clash over campaign finance between the major branches of party finance, the Congressional Committee for Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrowly won victory last March in a very popular special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political scientists have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The US considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, then backed down
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, to which Washington had little objection.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization’s leadership.
State Department officials have decided to summon the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest “their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions have only been imposed on El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including to control narcotics and provide development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings continued, representatives from North and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from travelling to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to continue, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their comments were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying History
The next tile could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, and the public record is now backed by substantial evidence.
Mueller would also direct his investigation to the issue of Trump’s campaign colluding with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If control of Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held to account before this body, as he prepares to represent himself before voters and, perhaps, before a jury of his peers.
These are many “ifs,” and I do not claim that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this fight.
In 1938, German officers were about to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up to him and pushed the Czechoslovaks back to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these divisions and the inevitable march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these cleavages.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the outcome of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since that newspaper reported that last year it offered to secretly record the president and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“What will we answer if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial – or if he is confided to the Supreme Court despite accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump to account?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, which in the past occupied my residence as an ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With this legacy, I can’t help but be optimistic about our future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the win over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury deprived midfielder Graham Dorrans of his first appearance of the season until the 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the most of such a result to achieve feats.
“It was a positive for us, because Villarreal is a quality team,” said the 31-year-old forward.
“We went into the game thinking we’d get something and left with a point.
We might have won in the end, but on the whole, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a bit of luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match as they made a good result in their last match, nevertheless I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys are having a lot of fun; the training is quality.
Let’s hope we can move forward now, leave last season behind and triumph.”
Women no longer sleep because of this fear about their retirement savings
Although the survey participants were clear about how they wanted to be cared for, few people discussed the issue with their family members.
Nearly half of those who participated in the national study said they talked with their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they told their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not doing what’s necessary to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t communicate your wishes to them well in advance.
Work with your counsellor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover those expenses, or other insurance on your wealth – provided you have the means to insure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in passing.
Provide a health care proxy that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will verify your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney regarding your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Think about the little details: Suppose your elderly relative has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
“It’s not just finances that are at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Put that plan in place.”
Man injured several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home from a party.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, at the time she was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the incident, which occurred at approximately 2:30 a.m., as a "random act."
The victim did not see her attacker.
His injuries did not threaten his life and the police called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the toll is expected to rise.
As communications were paralyzed, the emergency services could not receive any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated following the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, whose population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that runs along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the Regency, an administrative region located below a province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Circle of Seismic Fire and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on December 26 on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh triggered a tsunami that swept across 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 shook the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake shook the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes rocked the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, contravening a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a statement released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone of a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held in pre-trial detention in Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre and is being held on $500 unsecured bail, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself “not guilty, that’s for sure” when his plea was asked, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and is liable to a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a minor B-class offence, punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in reporting a domestic violence crime, and possession of an intoxicated weapon in connection with the incident.
His wife said he punched her in the face.
Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Several hundred dead
At least 384 people have died as a result of the earthquake that rocked the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake broke out just off the center of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Videos posted on social media show the point of impact.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu at the same time as the tsunami broke out on the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for terrorist suspect in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assailant who killed eight people – a rare sentence that hasn’t been applied in that state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing pedestrians and a cyclist on his road last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” murdered the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to seek capital punishment filed with the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury sentenced Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion, which are generally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “careful preparation and premeditation,” prosecutors said, calling the method used by Saipov “odious, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnaucco,” the statement of intent said.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
The Southern District of New York had not sought the death penalty in prosecutions for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for engaging in conspiracy and espionage for the USSR in the two years following the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told authorities that he was incited to carry out the attack after watching videos of Daesh on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the flag of Daesh in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was “obviously disappointed” with the decision to prosecute.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept his guilty plea and sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had already asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to “mobilize the people’s army” during a demonstration at the Conservatives’ conference.
The former UK Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” from eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested, he should be tasked with negotiating with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said during the Birmingham march that the UK “would have already been freed” if Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the dilemma May faces in reconciling her deeply divided troops has been underscored by conservatives in favor of staying in the Union who have joined an isolated anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite threats from those who want to get out and those who want to stay as well as from the EU.
The allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostilities – and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its agenda and “chaos.”
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to “get rid of Chequers.”
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and be entrusted with the task of negotiating with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have gone out already,” he said.
The member for Wellingborough added: “I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: “We did not engage in world wars to subjugate ourselves.
We want to make our own laws in our own homeland.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely wrong.”
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who is in favour of leaving, was also present at the march to tell journalists: “I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is also the case of our party and our activists who roam the streets and make us elect above all.
Give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to Ms. May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they deliver on their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians must be led to “feel the pressure” if they are about to betray the decision that was taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
They are trying to cheat Brexit and we are telling them today: “We will not let you get away with it.”
He added in a message to the cheering crowd: “I want you to put pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has allowed us to win Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, pro-European followers marched through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists have brandished banners of conservatives against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives because of the security issues regarding party enforcement at the start of the conference.
“They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place the computer systems and all the technology for Canada, plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a real farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of running for president
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future Saturday at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the GOP’s representative in the states, who served as co-chair in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been at the center of speculation that Trump could face off in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters at a town hall since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for the Chair.
Warren responded that the time had come “for women to go to Washington in order to fix our broken government, which involves having a woman head of state.”
Arrest at the shooting death of Sims from Louisiana State University
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the shooting death of basketball player Wayde Sims, an LSU basketball player, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 a.m.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying a man who was on the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims received a gunshot wound to the head and succumbed to his injuries,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247 sports on Saturday.
Wayde defended his friend and was shot by Simpson.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to being on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 2m youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, including 10 as a starter last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton heads to world title after the team’s guidance allowed him to win against Sebastian Vettel
It soon became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team’s instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From pole position, Bottas made a good start and brushed Hamilton on the flank as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel stepped into the pits first and left Hamilton to get into the turmoil at the back of the peloton, which should have been a deciding factor.
The Mercedes went through the pits one lap later and found themselves behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the interior part at the risk of resisting after a double defense attempt in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the very first round to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated much of the race while maintaining his tyres to aim for a speeding finish and advance Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He eventually made it to the pits on lap 44, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight laps, with Raikkonen finishing fourth.
It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team did an outstanding job to get a one-two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who pointed out that she did not disclose Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but argued that events in the Senate showed people were “bad, disgusting and dishonest.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that’s happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and nasty and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
“Seeing the disclosures and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked any information?
Remember his answer... did you leak information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
Have we leaked information... No, we haven’t leaked information,” he added, thinking of the senator’s impression.
Feinstein received the letter last July from Ford detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t divulge his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me to.”
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented Saturday night at the rally: "I will tell you, it was very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president hinted that the Democrats were using these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the malice, the pettiness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control,” the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars erased Friday’s Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants with a 5-3 return to Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants opened the scoring with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the tie before Dwyer returned the advantage to the Giants.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, securing them the win.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's players, who beat Dundee 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast, after being caught up.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two sides, with the Giants having triumphed in the last three games.
Dwyer gave the lead in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
In a busy first period, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt joined Cownie at 15:16 with an equalizer.
Dwyer secured the Giants’ lead before the first break when he hit his second goal of the night towards the end of the first period.
The local team came together and Bouchard tied again with a goal giving a power play advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing victory for his team by scoring a fifth goal midway through.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people on board a plane escape the quake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people can take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi island last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to ravage the area and large numbers of people are trapped under rubble in the town of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to give up his post in the tower violently shaken at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed there to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our heart is broken to learn this,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country’s disaster prevention agency indicating that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll would continue to rise as many bodies were still under the rubble and many could not be rescued,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Waves measuring up to six meters have ravaged Palu who will celebrate a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings bodies back.
Clean water is rare.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was rocked earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man has disappeared after a plane crashed into the lagoon.
The airline managing the crash in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims a man is missing, after all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, it has not been able to trace a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon near the airstrip.
Witnesses believed that the aircraft had overtaken the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived too low.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to slip into the water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
l claimed that the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy claimed that sailors who worked nearby to upgrade a dock also participated in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none were from Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned its case on Saturday at the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to trace the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that indicated Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers when he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the helm on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he was “lying because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The phone records show that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is due to begin pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held in front of the jury during the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by imbuing its music with positive messages.
Bristol’s The High Breed claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins in political messages and social issues.
The group wants to reconnect with its roots and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for firing her after ‘racist’ text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message mistakenly transmitted by the mother who complained that she was “still a Black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, and equates the prosecution with “extortion”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dismay at finding in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was Black when she arrived for her first day of work.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOON ANOTHER BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her "uncomfortable" gaffe, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, explaining that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was instead waiting for a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day’s work and then sent home by an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for her dismissal and is seeking $350 per day in compensation for the six-month home service for which she was initially hired, but without a contract.
“I want them to understand, listen, we don’t do that kind of thing,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to terminate Maurice's employment, fearing that they would not be able to trust him after harming him.
“My wife had sent him something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's see! "
Assimilated the trial to “extortion”, Plasco claimed that his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a “very delicate situation”.
“Would you pursue someone like that?
It’s not a very nice thing to do,” added the investment banker.
While the case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion did not hesitate to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors worried readers wouldn’t identify with a talking bear, new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It’s a lot of fun, knowing what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children’s book inspired by a little teddy bear, would have remained optimistic about the rejection of her work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the books’ publication had had a “bittersweet” flavor after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of our family,” and adds that her father was very proud of her final success.
“He was a pretty calm man, and he wasn’t a pretentious one,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a kid who does something: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always given credit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn’t expect her to make it,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then Nad called me to let me know that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to maintain the heart rate were slowly running out and coming out of his system.
She had died some time before and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was all happening.
I couldn’t scream or scream or cry since I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning for her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, regardless of the ordeal she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this immense sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning women drop postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I’m forced to feel on a daily basis,” she said.
Davis, 45, living in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up any room.”
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, 11-year-old Tyler’s brother found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid there's a ripple effect."
Davis created the maps "to let people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don’t be silent – you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Ms. Davis, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt down, depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw his attitude change.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their presents, he didn’t have eye contact with them or anything.”
She said her death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to get away with it: “It’s heartbreaking for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to move forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for – a time-limited investigation, limited in scope – maybe we could bring some unity,” Flake said Saturday, adding he feared the committee would “collapse” into a partisan dead end.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections will only be held in five weeks, on November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans score badly, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
We do not yet know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to decide the vote and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea: Number of deserters 'drops' under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un rose to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said 1,127 desertions took place last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said stronger border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs demanded by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of deserters in the North will ultimately be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China views deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still at war – have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the denuclearization negotiations that had previously remained unresolved.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they broadly agreed to work towards a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is out of the question that we will be the first to engage in unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is unfit to sit on Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of the parliamentary minority, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved this way, they would have called her "hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times almost screamed and choked when talking about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations about him a “grotesque and coordinated assassination” organized by liberals disappointed that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, since he showed that he was against the Democrats.
“I think he’s discrediting himself with these statements and the way he’s been attacking the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, but he’s also unfit to sit on the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation of charges hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh evaded the issue of the possible overturning of some Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It’s a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger spilling over, and she can’t get her out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s rare, do you?”
“I was greatly helped by a woman who was a cadre somewhere, who told me that she too was crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she got angry and was crying: ‘You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
And I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of a first job in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with inexpressible rage, was being grabbed by the skin of my neck by an elderly woman – a cold director who had always terrified me a little – who dragged me down a staircase.
“Don’t let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and are thrilled because they got you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart had been caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and had retired from the campaign, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-considered decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the running, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign was very advanced, she had fallen behind in fundraising, and so vowed that she would not participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually gave men $1,000 were only planning to give her $250.
“Do they think I’m entitled to a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions – the gratitude for the people who had supported her, the frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and the anger over sexism – that she felt dizzy.
“You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled of the press reaction to her.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my tombstone.
“Did she cry?”
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, taxing half of all goods from China that arrive in the United States.
Each time, Beijing retaliated in kind, most recently hitting tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China is committed to matching the U.S., and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to falter anytime soon.
To push Washington back is to give in to demands, but to give in publicly to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for an economic downturn in either country is actually much more dangerous than what observers have recognized before,” Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, told the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria is 'prepared' for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild this country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and more secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of this devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries sponsoring the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States team with a final score of 16.5-10.5 at the Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team crossed the mark of 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble for most of the tournament, pushed his start in the water at the 16th hole in par-3, giving up his duel to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever reach 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, which first ran in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was sidelined 5-4 by the European team's worst-placed player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the all-time European champion with a career total of 25.5 points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today it’s stronger than me.
It was an eventful year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I’m happy to have been able to help,” Garcia said with emotion after the European win.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles last Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride, beating Tiger Woods, growing up watching this guy,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance about his team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a certain moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We’re going to come together, I’m going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we’re going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
We have to bow.
We were overtaken.”
Red tide update: Concentrations drop in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decrease in red tide concentrations in some areas of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties – raising fears of declining concentrations.
The red tide covers about 209 km (130 miles) of coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
There are islets about 16 km (10 miles) off Hillsborough County, but in fewer locations than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or off Pinellas County were reported last week, low to high concentrations off Hillsborough County, higher concentrations in Manatee County, higher concentrations at the bottom of Sarasota County or offshore, medium concentrations in Charlotte County and low concentrations in Lee County and offshore, high concentrations at the bottom or offshore in Collier County.
Cases of respiratory irritation persist in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
