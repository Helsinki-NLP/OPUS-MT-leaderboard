UKIP survivors who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You talk about when Nigel Farage says the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the undesirables.
First you use specious arguments, then you discredit them with thinly veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to line up behind chronic hypochondria intolerant people who think everything is due to them.
I think it's you who's using specious arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the crazies of the right, practically does not exist.
I think that's what we call democracy.
Then no one would be affected by UKIP’s measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
Only in the parallel universe of UKIP can Carswell appear as a revolutionary.
A citation from a rag does not constitute evidence.
Yes, shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a specious argument is.
You also don’t know anything about my personal situation or identity, so you should be careful when trying to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage's sentence surprised a lot, but only because we rarely talk about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You'll have to be able to get over it.
I’m not sure where you’re coming from, but I guess you don’t like it when the media talks about what you don’t like.
It is so rarely talked about because unlike Farage and his crazy followers of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, so no.
In the end, the situation is as bad in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis coming the period of austerity will not have settled anything.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland was the ‘tiger of Europe’ we were touted a few years ago.
We knew what happened next!
This is great to read the article.
We are trying to make people believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a "NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE" is taking place.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest companies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients there is nothing to "pave" for the moment with the coming of the Poles.
In the 80s of the 20th century, irlance was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal considering a constant period, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was ahead.
That their development has not been a long quiet river, it is sure in view of recent events.
Lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a 0% tax rate on businesses.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the politicians about the taxes actually paid by the multinationals.
According to a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only small businesses pay full price.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars in every corner, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery has been evident in the daily traffic jams since the start of the year.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don’t worry, I’m sure the comments will soon catch fire.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a collision with the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I believe Mr. O'Leary will soon be buying a whole new fleet of aircraft, so some bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I’m flying with him next week, so hopefully it won’t be on one of those two once patched up.
It would be the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair charge passengers extra for the additional fear they were given?
But without that kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I’ve never taken Ryanair and the last 3 times I’ve flown it was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can take it to heart.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair away from those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the base fare just have to go after themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be happy with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error of the airport air traffic controllers.
The passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Have a good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally teeming with people.
People do not come en masse for the quality of the restaurants (some, for the most part) nor for the Salon de la revue at the Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With a lot of foreigners spending...
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sundays, crowded with 50% of tourists.
Oaloes Faux!
The only argument that would seem to me admissible is that of the areas receiving a significant number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy tax-free.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons.
Remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sundays, allow to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right enjoyed, with some exceptions, by employees.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for the Economy nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs have any competence to reform the Labour Code.
As they close it.
What is the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies who want to work on Sundays.
In Montreal on Sunday APM I take my grandchildren to the municipal library.
In my city of 30000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture...
This is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he tenaciously defended against fascism
the way of life he tenaciously defended against fascism and Bolshevism
What if her daughter’s estate was, against her will, used to pay the estate fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some are not terrible.
No doubt his estate would want his share of the cake, if you pass on the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and add also his well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
Neither do I.
But for five years, and only for five years, he was perfect.
In 1940 he stood up to other government aristos who wanted to discuss a “deal” with the Nazis and he very cleverly won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium, and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having had during those five years, just those five years, Churchill at the helm and no one else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
Whether his descendants sell the paintings on the open market to raise money from inheritance fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them collect the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only favour large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, since infrastructure projects are by definition not very renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the minister, they reflect the real French evil: distrust towards dialogue.
Back to the princeps values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest of us not be in need!
Either in solidarity we come to his help, or he has RIGHT in exchange for the services he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to smic fits that vision.
There is also the landlord who lives off the income from his properties.
It is necessary to differentiate between those who invest for a return at the time of their retirement and those who live off their pensions.
A property to rent or two for a couple above, it's vice
The little genius of finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great works, but at a time of lack of great infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of degrowth is emerging in response to a recession that is only a savage and therefore brutal degrowth.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investment is glaring: isolation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc...
A tax that favors high incomes and rentiers.
Who is in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is a gallop.
Samsung's profits are being hurt by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple’s mid-September introduction of larger screens for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have appealed to shoppers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided on the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple’s benefit.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft implemented this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition we all have different needs and they can only be met by one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people attach no value to the design, for them the options, functionality and price prevail.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Stop looking for a “better platform.”
Is there a “better car manufacturer”, not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
This is in everyone's interest.
I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, of course, Parisian bobos) could they tell us of which author(s) they fight ideas on the genre and indicate us the works they intend to fight precisely.
Or do they just tackle the genre as described in The Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
All right, Jean, I like you, and you're a smart, educated person.
I said this about Judith in the vein of Furusato evoking Holofernes, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I do not have his quickness of mind).
Otherwise, in the background, since you refer to it, this subject does not interest me, and sincerely I do not see where the problem is: I hoped that you and your friends could get me out of my backwardness, because I am slow but I understand well...
John: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holofernes does.
Who is afraid of the world?
What are we afraid of those who are afraid?
Furasato and O give us some answers.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic slitter of throat.
We can see how these studies affect the most intimate at home.
We are obviously no longer in the debate of ideas.
It's something else, much deeper.
Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
A: I thought it was a good idea to go to the sources.
Pretending to fight ideas based on the mere statement made by their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem to me very rigorous.
But, as I explained to our friend umpfrontist, it is all the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I am not sure that the nuance is understood.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I was content with the "second sex" (it was more of my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to the wishes of Lo.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a little the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night’s cloud would really squeeze the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Flash special blood moon.
Tony Abbott/Joe Hockey blames Labor.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will return it to its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with that, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week with the Perseid meteor shower and for virtually all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I am beginning to think that there is a bad genius whose sole purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, although things are getting much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn’t see the eclipse because of the clouds above the Melbourne suburb.
I'll put a TAX on this eclipse.
Anyone watching this eclipse should pay a tax.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last before you go to bed.
Who or what will haunt you when it ends (obviously) disappears?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed.
Beautiful photo of the moon above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing about stock market and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the inequalities between income from labor and capital.
Nothing about tax evasion.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon.
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hypertext link to the original documents so that one can form an opinion.
See today Tuesday, October 15 the results of the miracle recipes: in Spain, exports are at the lowest in five years.
In Greece, the stock market is collapsing.
However, these are the examples to follow.
The reform of the notaries would generate a claim for compensation in the order of 8 billion euros.
The Department of the Economy tells us that these claims are not well-founded.
What if there is an error from the Ministry of the Economy?
Will the decision-makers who have reaped the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of the notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The rest in its time.
Okay, thanks, JYL...
The State is not comparable to households in terms of the management of its budget because the time horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifetime of its members.
Moreover, unless we consider that public spending is unproductive, it contributes to financing material and immaterial investments that will guarantee future growth and therefore future revenues.
Some elements of the answer.
A regrettable decision.
But remember Hippocrates’ sacred oath: the health of the profits of the world’s pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your fantasy.
The medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands bound by the law as written by the policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgeries, safe shooting rooms for addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these questions politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Because the Liberals want our health care system to look like the one in the United States, you should find out how it works.
All over the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame the toubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, prioritize business profits and “research.”
Read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare the worldwide prices of drugs present everywhere, as well as differences from country to country on what is over the counter or only on prescription.
It is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations for oncological pain, despite the laws that hold them back and the expensive permits required.
While manufacturers of some drugs may not be happy about using alternatives such as marijuana, those who come up with a version offering good quality products in known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you madam but you’re wrong, there’s a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a manager of this hospital.
You can't hold patents on grass.
If social science “researchers” were doing research instead of politics and networking, perhaps their “work” could be used.
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
To compare is to make pedagogy not research.
One cannot say "the research is completed it must be applied" and then in the same jet "one must experiment at all goes".
If your research is successful, why experiment?
If your research is not successful, why do you ask us to apply it?
Can I be explained how a "researcher" can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could assimilate mathematics and other subjects more easily?
New technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that students learn to use new technologies but how would they manage to learn new technologies if they do not know how to learn?
Pisa tests are just an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What is the point of building an indicator that informs you of what suits you, a desire for self-promotion, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to distance sophists and ideologues from training and that practitioners teach practitioners.
fabrice reread the paragraph on internships (which unfortunately is not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion pushes us to the most inefficient conservatism: "It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of the practices in force, and that does not allow to advance the system ".
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, we cannot wish that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their place in a modern teacher training.
Education theorists must have no place.
Practitioners need to have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems in the education system.
To give more weight to the theorists of education would be to destroy it definitively.
Your analogy is totally flawed: if I would not like to be operated on by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, I would even less like to be operated on by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned on the job.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP for David Cameron's fight against copyright infringement
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
Thank you very much.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright, I’ll just have to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement is theft.
It is the same since they must cite their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license doesn’t cost anything.
No, it's a copyright infringement.
Not at all the same thing.
By using content without the proper license, you are depriving artists of their livelihood.
You can still debate pedantic assumptions - but that's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become true.
This is a copyright infringement.
Go on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright
Obviously, you don’t mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for pictures used in school homework, an almost perfect definition of what a reasonable use should be, then I’m happy to deprive them of that fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be to show how, if the children themselves create anything and post it on their favorite social networks, they give up all intellectual property to the site under the terms and conditions they have clicked on.
Maybe if they share their mp3 player’s headphones with a buddy on the school bus, they should be kicked out for breaking the law in such a way.
Ah if we could export this resource that we are full of, the rasher who says that everything is going wrong....
If it is a PS member who says so, then we must believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are old enough to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by continually assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What pulls France down is speeches like yours.
I have always worked in a private company.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies led by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I am an employee because I know that I do not have the skills to run a company and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the null bosses that I meet frequently.
At ease in my sneakers I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he tells the horrible truth!
If one compares with German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to demand reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large companies and medium and small companies.
Should the government hold their hand?
That state they accuse of imperiousness?
Jacques L.
Always this anti-business couplet on your part!
Remind me, what have you created as a job, as an added value, to be so severe?
Pat, I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who sulk and minaude while waiting for the permanent assistantship of the State!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employers’ burdens, taxes, work 45 hours a week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages if not their suppression!
I look forward to seeing all the “negative” comments on this topic.
Which is ironic considering how people always complain about First Group.
From where I'm from, Last hasn't really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay afloat rather than transform.
That doesn't mean Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of them.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do that.
I tried to get them recently, but I didn't succeed.
But hey, Labour's gonna get us out of trouble, isn't it...
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the UK from creating a more moral business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all for the decision to finally be overturned.
And there’s something better: MTR, a Hong Kong company, won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally for pooling and sharing and believes that workers must all help each other across borders.
We can therefore assume that they will be happy with this decision ;)
This may be because Dutch management is on track while British management is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but, above all, new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
“She was a beating girl.”
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being "beating" is a higher quality than many others, the concern for others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "beating" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancer "beating", which are none the less dead, I know of palanquées.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's start again, too.
I'm not telling you it's THE condition to heal, I'm telling you it helps.
Nothing to do with any merit.
As for the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'll do it again.
To insinuate, even for a moment, that one can have merit in getting out of a disease or that one can demerit not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that lets go, from everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
Sorry to think otherwise, if, having a strong morale probably makes it easier to accept heavy treatments and to prepare for them, to try experimental treatments as did this woman and not refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is a fighter in medicine is above all someone who trusts medicine.
But if we prefer to rely on the "lord" it is something else.
Not with merit or courage.
These considerations are unique to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you get robbed to the point of becoming a zombie.
Personally, I caught two of them, dirt, fat, and if I “struggled” as these psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only of clenching your teeth, suffering hell and taking the blows.
I thought the charge against Milosevic was decided and finalized about a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted “quickly” and then swept under the carpet.
Is that the story we told at the time?
The Communist-turned-nationalist who unleashed three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what has been voluntarily left out: 1.
How could NATO bombing be legal under THE LEAST rule of international law?
Which country did Serbia attack?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he'd be swallowed by the Western steamroller.
Westerners used a smokescreen to detach a part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was quickly recognized by Western states who then lied end-to-end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term for failing to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in politics at the time.
Ultimately, the Guardian shouldn’t call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we didn’t like him).
As far as I know, there is only one method of predicting earthquakes in Greece that works by measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This type of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results with us.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to have detectable water molecules", according to a study conducted by the team of Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
Method to follow.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat coming.
Thank you Passeur de sciences for regaling us, often, with these experimental feats that are carried out in the world.
How would the animals know (in advance)?
No doubt by the perception of other elements whose rate evolves in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas a priori odorless for humans but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments he has at his disposal.
We don’t have a reliable result on these tracks.
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report on arte recounting the struggle of two scientific teams, one from California, the other from Japan, to have the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and more particularly to their modification before an earthquake.
I’m not a scientist, but their assumptions convinced me.
Or are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature again.
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious magazine, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the “signs” given by the animals, we run into the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the goldfish was spinning strangely in circles.
I don't understand how anyone would think Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He has done too much as Mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can’t help but think that this man knows nothing about it and always tries to distract with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He could not name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor and he did not keep one.
It just underscores how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was on “Have I Got News For You.”
Because he's a celebrity and we've instilled celebrity worship in people.
Londoners voted for him and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes over the leadership of the party, the Tories’ popularity rating is going to break the ceiling I’m sure.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be a joke.
That’s exactly what they said about Londoners.
He should have brought his friend with him, who was smarter than him.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French have really and always disinterested themselves in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have bothered to read a few books (there are some, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the “Solomon” and the “Strait of Scrap” speak, unfortunately as much as the dead who remained there.
It is understandable that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be there from the bottom since the battle of Savo) do not want to return.
We actually passed in front of the island of Savo, in the Iron Bottom Sound.
Even if the mission is coming to an end.
It's the little ones.
But the ecolo side is a total smoke.
Calculate the kerozene consumes to reach the goal completely discredits the concept..
Just browse the list of sponsors that philanthropists.
One more operation neither done nor to do.
The cow, it makes you want too much!!!
I look forward to the webseries!
Your review makes me dream, identifying me a little bit in passing (I also learned to sail with the Crocos de L'Elorn at the Moulin Blanc in Brest harbor!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Keep making us dream, and show with pride that the Bretons are great travelers!
Pierre, from Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think that the red hat that demonstrated against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not spend a penny of our taxes to finance the dreams of some adventurers even as friendly as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian squad who are of Kosovar origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly at Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don’t know if they are still in the team.
Bisevac is the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfielder or before in the 70s and 80s and coached many teams in Greece, but I don’t know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as a striker in Velez’s big team which, under the tutelage of legendary Suleman Rebac, twice finished second in the Yugoslav league (and also included such high-profiles as Vahid Halilhodzic and Arsene Wenger’s loyal teammate Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at Juventus, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was related to Blackburn *frisson*
Now, I can't help you.
I know he lost his seat when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he's not in charge.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of the real Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all areas where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there wasn’t too much damage (as far as I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the major European powers decided to give parts of the country to neighboring countries.
How could one have felt an “explosion of joy” when seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men, and children without doubt are inside?
How???
What bothers me a little in this "testimony" is that the mere fact of having been able, even once, to rejoice spontaneously in the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies to me of a personality "border line" from which all the "testimonies" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
No doubt in the short moment of "joy", we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
It will have just been thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to do truly and apocalyptically evil to the great evil Satan in his very heart.
To make qqch of powerful.
Of grandiose.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims gnawed by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We suspected it a little.
The “Christian/White/Gaulish” West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the musuman when he contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of the Arab Muslim world today.
I am talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The splendor of the past, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this evil funnel?
Totally in phase, two major poisons irrigate the Arab world: the bigoted conservatism of the powers in place and the fascistic nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
That it has been understood before, must not drive back the Muslims.
That's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose this is true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, damp and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Plus, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I suffer from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The countryside in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of about to die.
In Britain, if you’re lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a nice summer this year, do not make your grumpy who rattles clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now I'm retired and I don't develop immunity to outside germs anymore, it can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a feverishness that culminates with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, snow hazards and many other wonderful words.
Just don’t stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, those dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxization of the increases for children , it is the amount collected by the State which mainly comes from the deciles 8 to 10 .
But in terms of the number of households that have seen their taxes increase as a result of this measure , it is mainly deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median incomes ) according to graph 2 .
The removal of the half-share especially concerning widows is not treated at all in the article or rather its impact is completely undervalued: 230M euros it is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not about to get any better.
Well, we're not on the straw, but thinkers
For once the PS makes a rather left-wing policy, we will not cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let’s keep it that way and you’ll encourage those 20% to work less or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live the Trots and the OCIs recycled in the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you can't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population holds 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it forbids anyone to raise as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money is exceeded, money is only used to make money, that is to say to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We are among the richest 20%.
Probably also the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, part of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax should allow these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or else you might as well give up and live social minimums, especially if you have social housing.
The Utopias of Khmer Rouge head cutters have happily lived.
I did two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or face any hassle.
All you have to do is go to someone's house, sleep in it, put away behind you and leave.
From now on this will be my first option when I am traveling.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need some kind of homeowner’s insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, six hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
“It’s very dangerous and highly risky” No, it’s not true.
You've just really run out of luck.
According to the link provided in the article:
To his displeasure, Airbnb’s response to Teman was quick, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he received no support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I am looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I’m considering paying a down payment and a month’s rent all at once but I’m a little afraid to send $1,600 to a site I’ve never really heard of.
But where are we going?
“Support the troops,” sang the Bu$herie in all tones.
Innocuous weapons.
I am sure that it will be a pleasure for the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds who died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically altered by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to stay polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not very clear the style of the author: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it's time to weaken the military to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are always at war.
Alternative: It’s ALWAYS time to strengthen education, because we’re still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if they were "made" to work 35 hours instead of 17.
At the moment, our teachers are earning more than engineers.
And let us not be made to believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their curriculum.
But it can not be seen since the National Education does not have the means to provide an office at the college / high school to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in short, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, the internet connection, or the supplies.
Besides, it is so much the hideout at 17h per week and 4 months of vacation that we can not fill the CAPES of maths, come, we are waiting for you.
What do you mean you don't want to fuck some uneducated dick whose parents spit on you calling you a wanker?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadis so that the khurd population can flourish better.
Where we see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first job I graduated from was in sales, in London, earning three times nothing and yet it was a job for which I needed a degree.
A year later, I saw an ad to be a London Underground worker, it was paid an extra $5,000 a year and we didn’t even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
On this subject, don’t worry if you can’t find a graduate job, try to find something that either pays well, or that you like to do.
If I had stayed in graduate jobs, I would still be paying my student loan.
I don't like working in a company so much, so I hope to eventually move on to either the public service or academia.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a backlog of three years.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of bisounours as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political science, that is to say what is called the diplomas of the unemployed.
I have one of those diplomas and I finished production manager.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree but, as the article above says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
Although the starting salary was lower, we are quickly climbing the ranks because in the real world what matters is the results more than the knowledge.
This debate engineering studies / artistic tracks have been going on for years.
Scientists can’t solve every problem, it’s more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time, and interact with people in a way that gets results.
Are literature, philosophy and art bisounours?
That's ridiculous.
I guess you’re talking about degrees kind of media study or whatever abscense track you’ve been to.
Literature, philosophy, political science and art are real sectors.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn’t it be better to have a real territorial policy to relieve the congestion in Paris and boost the rest of France?
Personally, I do not see the inhabitants of the end of the Essonne and Val-d'Oise going 80km round trip every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
The inhabitants within the walls and the small belt already have many means of public transport that are much more convenient (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and locked parks, as they already exist in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
You might as well benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we couldn't find a place for ONE bike hanger.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë.
Well, it's not all right.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other users of public transport the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that stand out are: 1/ it is hyper dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that drive super fast and do not care about the survival of bicycles 2 / we take a lot of pollution in the head For me the bike paths are worse to go, we have to reduce the traffic type (peage road)
Bicycle paths are apartheid, we must cohabit but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in Paris?
Not a word about the place of cycling in public transport?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% bike travel is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens into the flour.
Moreover, according to GOLD, the EELV deputies seem sceptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket begins, it would be better to find out who is really behind this massacre.
Hint: It's not Russia.
I’m not sure I like the way the world is changing.
Looks awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer has expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
In addition, they would have to file complaints first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Libya didn’t blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not at fault, the fault lies with the authority responsible for the safety of the airspace, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other planes had been shot down previously, Ukraine launched air attacks against the rebels in the area and any plane could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Did the Ukrainian government take reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or did it choose to play with the lives of innocent people so that the airlines pay the rights to fly over the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who are defending their usurper government – the ultra-nationalists of Western Ukraine – and who want to basically demonstrate that Putin shot down Flight MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The precedent: A 1986 ruling by the International Court of Justice that concluded that the CIA’s supply of weapons to the Contra rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will let this matter go to the ICJ.
It’s funny to think that Abbott wants to tell Putin that Australians have been murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations.
So far, investigators have not said anything like that.
To call yourself Ricardo and be such a beotian in eco, it's distressing!
Calling itself Polaris is losing the north is rejoicing.
A single question of the Belotian: is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can’t help but notice that those who most virulently criticize Piketty’s book haven’t read it!
It’s easy to read, it took me a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of income from labor, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
He shows that the concentration of capital today joins that of the beginning of the 20th before 1914, he shows that it is the two world wars that have lowered the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how concentration resumes after 1914.
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limitations.
Second, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is correct, one can debate it without having read the book whose main point is to argue one way in favor of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his piece summarized by the press false?
I haven't read it and won't read it.
So I rely on the summary of his central thesis and it is this one that seems pure sham to me.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Hasn’t humanity been enriched in general?
And this enrichment, coupled with an increase in population, is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and definitely deserves the award.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age at which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this award will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments that want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
My best wishes to Malala, but she must realize that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the working class neighborhoods of Britain!
Did anyone think his speech was a little strange?
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she wasn’t where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Isn’t Malala herself one of those “colorful perverts”?
You should not have any "airtime" on this site.
You yourself are a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
Her father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and always has been, for her to receive a higher education and have the right to decide for herself about her marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he believes that women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at 14, without having a say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it eloquently enough for you.
It may seem contradictory, but perhaps it means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years old.
Rather disappointed by this entry in terms of season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who obviously has a little trouble finding her character of lookalike of Marlene Dietrich.
I just watched the last two seasons which are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most accomplished!
A fascinating first episode.
The production is close to perfection and the show of Jessica Lange singing the anachronistic Life on Mars by Bowie is simply stunning.
I haven’t watched this new season yet (which will be the last one for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I would rather have all of a sudden than watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is sure, apart from Jessica Lange extraordinary, it is especially the risks of staging and editing that stunned me.
We have in AHS an avalanche of original plans that ridicules the sanitization of today's productions.
It escapes me a little to see you throw in the towel in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things.
No, it's just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her path and the way she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series outside of the technical qualities.
Well, I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, she wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's going to end like 24 hours.
Everyone does what they want!
It is by what I say "I will not look after" that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I simply share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think it will be fatal to her.
But then, that's just my opinion.
Let’s talk less about tax increases, please – let’s cut back on government spending instead.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to slash spending have failed.
Initiate controversies over relatively small items of expenditure, such as development aid
The problem is that this is less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuance rather than the change in direction that voters seem to want, and all this time some on each side are pretending that nuance is much more important and substantial than it is – and voters see clearly in their game and find it in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenses.
“Debt” is assets held primarily by financial institutions in this country.
“Debt” is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government appropriating a third of my income (before even talking about consumption taxes) if I thought it was going to use it wisely.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage was not entirely honest about how to reduce taxes, but if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies for wind turbines almost useless and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you come up with a figure that makes the Labour and Lib-Dem tax on the most luxurious residences look ridiculous.
Your first $10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns $35,000 a year will pay about $5,000 (one-seventh of their salary), someone with $50,000 would pay around $10,000 (one-fifth), etc., and someone with $200,000 pays about $70,000 (just over a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking fees and the car sticker, and this is before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car sticker.
I get paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that this is a problem, of course, I’m happy to pay my taxes.
But let’s not pretend to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it’s not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes go.
How can an unemployed person looking for work at the door prove it?
Even if 20% of the unemployed would not look, it means that 80% seek and do not find.
Being unemployed myself, do I have a better interest in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 resumes, that increases my chances by as much.
Indeed I have not heard from Pôle Emploi for months, does that mean that agents are more busy with control operations than really bringing in job ads?
I don't see the point.
Because it is not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough jobs, then it is necessary to do without Pole Emploi.
How is this a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that the unemployed do their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks for their transport ticket from the users of a means of transport, a head of service or are the employees of their work, etc.
Nobody screams scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had to deal with Pôle Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, cut by 40%, it was necessary to fight hard.
It takes time!
I am not an expert in law.
Charting and control is currently taking over, while Pôle Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only the employees, they are the ones who pay the costs.
Non-salaried politicians and French people are granting themselves rights that they do not actually have!
That's not normal.
I would add that a dignified unemployment insurance contributes to the valorization of paid work.
More than waiting for murderous tweets in Arabic...
In reality it is necessary to have a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Death in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the presence of mind to ban this year the Hajj in Mecca to Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have had their visa applications denied because of their home country or recent travel.
In fact there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the Hajj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from flying to Europe?
I thought it was common sense, but apparently those who "know" decided that you could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed under strict quarantine.
Nobody's going out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were infected after having contact with people in West Africa despite taking “all necessary precautions.”
We can stop the spread of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let us forbid them to offer to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be quarantined immediately.
Let him get the message out of the first individual and the second group (including religious) and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is capable of erecting in dogma the image of God characterized by the total of the cortices of the planet in operation.
It is still a long way from that conception.
It’s only been 20 years since information emerged as humanity’s bounty, while religion, derived from the cerebellum, has been directing our actions since perhaps Lucy.
What is the point of becoming an umpteenth Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not set foot in the Church anyway, it is enough to see the low number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, removing the notion of sin, too "anxiety"?
Sorry, the church doesn’t have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe it will reach more people...
Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect for others as you envisioned it pre-existed to Christ.
Hillel a century before said to him already: "Do not do to others what you do not want to be done to you, this is the whole Torah and the rest is only comment: go and study!".
Christianity goes far beyond simple reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "advancement of justice, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is this a return to communism? :-)
The next step is to remove the incarnation and resurrection.
Jesus will remain the hero who upset moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then forcibly converted and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming soon.
It can't be invented.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even took part in its fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth $30.
If you’re interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for $30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM for $30 and is also offering a 20% discount coupon.
I'll take a look.
Obviously not at work.
The joy flaps of the IT department block all nice sites.
Hello, is it $30 then 20% off, or does the $30 include the 20% off?
Please note: the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but can't play it.
Plus I bought it on Steam, so no refunds, it's zero.
It's time to buy a new video card *shuts up*
This is a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I believe.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn’t use it myself.
Amazon $30 for PC, $35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, $44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'll delete it from your library if they decide to crack down on the people who buy it there while they're out of the intended area.

So, was 1940’s France a “putrid land”?
Say, this Nobel Prize seems like a poisoned gift to me.
Should we love the France of 40, that of the "strange defeat"?
When we see who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature, we wonder if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, we do not even want to read the award-winning authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano which is already difficult to read in French and which describes a universe so limited and so egocentric?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant connection with literature.
Have you read it at least?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano at its true value, if they don't already know him!
On your side, continue to frequent Lévy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep their chances.
So let's see who won the Nobel Prize for Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hey, the ugly ones.
Ever since I drove one in Iceland, I’ve been seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham Beer and Cider Festival.
It was messy.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not just CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real beginner's chance I was able to leave with several decent bets.
I hope that if I get to 95 I will be as lively as he is.
Last night I went to a fancy cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire Mr.
Read Buddha a little and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wishing to annoy you, I think you are moving a little further away from the subject.
This famous totality, it forbids quests for the jihadis at the exit of the mosques.
It immediately reports arms trafficking.
Either you have your eyes wide open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or you have your eyes wide closed.
You have to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you make a monumental contradiction: all the authorities, organizations or representative associations, Muslim or not, having formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, the French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
He who does not say a word consents.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like the French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and to demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt it.
This principle is in my view the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the disintegration of French society.
If there is no doubt, just say it.
Who does not say a word consents, but consents to what?
Consent to a proximity to ISIL or to the conviction of ISIL.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to spare the goat and cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, “revenge” the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has widened between their proposals for decentralisation and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified at the thought of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't give a damn about Scotland because they don't have a seat in it.
They can do what they want with electoral impunity.
I don’t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that Labour losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a good thing in the long run for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMISE" thinking he was saving his party but not realizing that he was signing the death warrant of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are holding their leaders to account.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's what's more important.
Not if Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Waxing the pumps by 8% at the expense of 85% is not a great election strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish MPs can no longer vote on issues that concern England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists and it worked out well for her.
Yet he is still running for prime minister in 2015 and has been doing so since he won the Labour Party leadership.
So basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over their shoulder and see what they’re reading, how they’re reading, and all the way to the end.
It is East Germany's "Life of Others" or the KGB applied to the FRIC world...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the long run, this will at least have a sterilizing effect.
I am waiting for the next post: Amazon makes YOUR book according to YOUR profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!

Thanks for the article.
As under this system, DRM management is not implemented, I still have to read pirated files, books in the public domain or bought from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without a cookie.
Considering the price I paid for the Kobo, it's without regret.

There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be run by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenic kids on acid.
This is even worse if you take Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism into account.
It’s interesting that some Erdogan supporters think that Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine.
Well seen:-P But Turkey does not want to shoot itself in the foot, unless it wins something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will retaliate, so it is effectively shooting itself in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: “The PA reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad because it would endanger Israel’s security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran is sending a serious warning of retaliation or merely advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what is really surprising is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic engagement concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.
The reading of Indian Punchline is highly recommended to anyone who pays attention to details rather than to the mainstream media-swept gossip. The short article you are linking is important and should be read keeping in mind the previous realistic observations/warnings from Iran to offer from Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these “moderates” who are seriously fighting the ugly secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline policy is pushing the world to the brink and I would suggest to those who refer to non-existent “moderates” to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending other people’s children to fight in World War III.
“It’s even worse if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism” Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
There should be a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should we?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have any chance of being alive?
A little late for that, my friend.
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like 120 years?
A little late for that, right?
Particularly concerning the CUP triumvirate who planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after World War I by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a shady place in Central Asia around the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire there.
What a delirium!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek in vain contact with the real.
There are so many clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even in the womb of a surrogate mother.

As for the children!
What a shame to call them psychologically unbalanced futures.

The important thing is that this practice is framed so that the "merchandization" of the body is limited.
But cosmetic surgery, aren’t cosmetics also commodification of bodies?!
Anakronik Fareinheit ...
It is certainly more elegant to make a good in a distant country via the internet and Pay Pal than to assume his responsibilities and or to avoid the scandal in another centuries near home without shouting it at that time on all the roofs!
These practices were also not done in the name of the church!
It is not just Christians and believers who refuse these practices.
The fact remains that the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.

I don’t know why there are so many dismissive comments here about what Paul Mason is saying, maybe they’re posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on football that awaits your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson’s film, there has been a shortage of reports that truly reflect the reality of the culture of the North of England.
It’s no wonder that Paul Mason has grasped the social and political context, he understands things well.
Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can check it out if you’re in the London area in November: 99psoul is going to do soul vinyl again, including a lot of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15th at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought “always the same story”, but here is a well-written and well-thought-out article.

Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (by the way, this was also the case with Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock, and went into the water.
An Israeli had stolen them.
The Israeli representative got up angry and shouted, “What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren’t even there at the time!”
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not let down their guard.
That this displeases the anti-Israelis is obvious, it is not the goal sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
This has always been the case since politics became globalized.
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, that is for sure, it continues!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What was the force behind the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a balance of power today!
Do you doubt it?!!!
Plus it’s not all about Russell Brand, but Guardian reporters seem to be struggling to get beyond anything he doesn’t have to say.
Many of what he says are just pseudo-chomskyste nonsense written by no others.
This proves that you do not understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
It’s just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it’s a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, maybe truths you’d rather not think about.
Hold on, this feeling is going to be more and more prevalent!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the nonsense of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a beginning populist, but this whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that he is just telling people not to vote and instead cross their arms and ignore the whole political process – but if you look at Paxman’s interview and other articles/videos he has posted, he is saying that voting once every five years for Labour or the Conservatives (or Lib Dems I guess) rather than just limiting those political engagements to saying that it is completely unnecessary for the two parties to vote once every five years.
I’m not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think being politically active in making his demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are weather vanes who will change their minds if they’re really at risk of losing the election), but it’s annoying to see all those condescending responses that say that this fool who makes Jesus will tell young people not to bother to vote.
His solution is extremely debatable and it would be nice if people debated what he actually said rather than simply labeling him as irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large amount of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The voting thing has been completely distorted.
The uselessness of putting a ballot in a ballot box every 5 years makes me very upset, since my vote really does not count for anything.
I want more referendums, e-voting, direct democracy and MPs who report locally to their constituents.
In addition, I contest the idea that Russell Brand’s words are not his own (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even though these are heavily influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics Suzanne would like to group together under the label of “pseudo-chomskyste blobs.”
I am pretty sure that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that’s what the Guardian could do, let Suzanne do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a verandah, with even the head nods added to the editing!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russel but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him on his show, it’s too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to go.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by mainstream media – including the Guardian – for generations.
This "slinger" reveals above all to me that the intellectual debate is no longer held for a long time at the meetings of History where the historians of trade have become minority and where the exchanges of specialists have become impoverished to the benefit of ready-to-think condensed type Sciences Po for press files.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to attack a culprit, a scapegoat.
They both develop very rational reasonings, but this rationality rests on these scapegoats which are the keystone of their thinking.
I believe rather that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This is a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magical thought.
We solve the problem of the relationship to the other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchizing, neo-lib and / or /libertarian slope (of the two terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing how to seek the help of the state for its markets) in the sense of at least state / not at all state at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that is beautifully self-organizing.
His thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt it does not stand.
Whoever says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a statement against the three intellectuals cited here.
Nor any support for that matter.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its then god, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault’s texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology from Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel in this way...
Gauchet poses a profound reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty represented by the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
Seeing this cabal orchestrated by hard-left social scientists who can’t stand the need for allegiance to their mantras is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other “yellows” that I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You haven’t had the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this topic, then.
And where was it in Russia that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I last saw a Chinese.
In London and they were friendly towards me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same of white people.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them making violently anti-White remarks.
My father is not happy that his eldest daughter is dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes in Russia have changed since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are getting richer, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, the Russians are mostly prejudiced against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or face high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Yenisei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the views of the Australians about the Chinese and the Aborigines.
It’s really weird for a stranger to tell me that I can’t stand the Chinese, whereas I’ve met two of them in my life (including one abroad), didn’t have bad memories of them, all people are equal and, in fact, those in London were very nice that’s the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don’t remember who we meet, all people are equal, how to remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
Let you and the other Russian here talk about the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with said White.
How many Chinese men are with Whites, by comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Whites would attack them PHYSICALLY.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
Yet it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left like the union of the judiciary...
Marabout: sorry, but the judicial circles are frankly brand right.
As for the Syndicat de la magistrature, they represent only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made from the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it commands to remove two obstacles.
That of the political vision of the observer as that of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
It then remains the mandatory tool of the law to refocus the evaluation on the fundamentals.
The extent of its non-observance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, forces a distinction to be made between the error and the partiality of magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice are not divided among these three groups.
Pretentiousness and ignorance are not an objective analysis.
And if all this is not analyzed, how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only by statistics implicitly revealing that it starts from very low.
The previous preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
The corruption of the judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The domain considered is that of the plundering* of heirs committed up to the means of frauds to the procedure* by genealogists estates mandated by notaries.
This profession gets 150 million euros a year while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the quasi-impunity judicial* of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this joins the said statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogist and heirs reluctant to be thus robbed, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all the laws favorable to the heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring this kind of rational criteria an elaborate form of lies?
Definitely prohibitive prices.
More material to scam the disabled.
You can say that, but my brother has one of these all-terrain tricycles, built to measure to his height and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors as never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and bulky tires, could.
As they say, taste and color.
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson might invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks epic.
I think the inventor of the Whill never had to clean a dog poop on a caterpillar.
I’m sure my sister would love the all-terrain tricycle, but it’s just too expensive.
The ultra long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled with a penchant for longboarding.
There are hills here that they would like.
The prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put that kind of price in a bike, so “you see”.
The all-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor.
Many of them have insurance at their disposal for a reasonable amount.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is, the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to charge high prices for things they know we need.
We can’t really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, this is just a draft, it is not intended to be manufactured.
I'm saying that the "long-distance" wheelchair doesn't come on the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive shelling of densely populated residential neighborhoods.
Two million people have been trapped in Israel’s blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power in the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half of them are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade!
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation too, since this blockade imposes a “collective punishment” on all civilians in Gaza.
“Entrepreneurs who work on their projects are diverting a little bit of their cement to the black market.”
Ah, that's not wood, but concrete and armed the lady...
References are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The right cement goes into the tunnels!
There is the black market, for sure, and recognized.
Two million people have been trapped in Israel’s blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, unacceptable to anyone with a heart and a moral sense.
The United States has a well-kept territory: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded him!
Do not forget that after lifting it, Morsi had re-established the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Blockade is Israeli-Egyptian.
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built against the back of the population that has chosen its masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought it over.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the non-profit sharing economy.
Many are only looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it’s getting paid (or at least hoping) in another way.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, homeowners and tenants who trust each other often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all of this?
“What does she rent out?”
No problem with the verb, what’s wrong with your grammar?
The verb "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you haven't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure that it is 100% compliant with all safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers permission to practice a commercial activity there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it's really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc.?
The barges are so slow that if someone tried to steal it it would still be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates.
all those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our houseboats...
Where are you going to moor it?
Marine Le Pen is not right.
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase of wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to get poorer.
High finance, speculates, plays with our companies, therefore our jobs, with our raw materials, therefore our purchases, our food, with the structures of care, therefore our health, with our debts, therefore our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold.
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obese of the money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said, “my enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance.”
That was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed Minister of the Economy a former Rothschild banker, in order to better defend the interests of the banksters, who alone were responsible for the crisis of 2007.
Was there no one else competent?
What do you call it: flip your jacket, lower your pants?
Primary and populist reaction
I don’t really know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I’m not sure that Spee really “refused” to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that neither side seemed sure of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was rough at the beginning of the day; I don’t know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Falklands, where, in the photos showing the survivors being rescued, we see a calm sea in broad daylight.
In addition, rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, that’s not exactly what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"A certain confusion reigned among the German ships as to the fate of the two battleship cruisers, who had disappeared into the dark after having ceased firing, and a chase began.
The Leipzig saw something on fire, but as it got closer it saw that it was just a wreck.
The Nuremberg, slower than other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, leaning and badly damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his searchlights at the ship's flag, the offer to surrender was refused and he opened fire, eventually sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged Good Hope to have escaped and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Worried about reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he headed north.
So, if this is true, the Germans, groping in the dark before the invention of radar, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not look for survivors.
They also thought there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have severely damaged them, so in confusion they scrambled to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should make their way through many ships of the Royal Navy.
Cradock’s sacrifice had already harmed them and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally caught.
Several votes are raised at the UMP to ask that it be written in the law that an elected official definitively condemned is therefore definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect elected representatives of the left of course.
But nooon, that's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSED A REGISTRATION AT THE WALL OF THE CONS OF THE MAGISTRATS
When is the ban on trade unions in sectors that are already protected?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to cajole those who will take advantage of their irremovability to hinder the actions of real politicians, who are really trying to make things happen, not the beautiful talkers whose immobility is commensurate with their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little signs "money for justice" they came from the provinces and did not differentiate between Bercy and the POPB.
She supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of her party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing or even far-right trade unions targeted personalities on its side and waged a legal-media war against them.
Your affirmations are completely free.
If, at the moment, the right is paying attention to the judicial news, it is simply that it has committed acts that fall under it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with justice, but not everyone who has been the subject of its attention has had preferential treatment.
On the other hand, it must also be remembered that the judicial union, which is on the left, is not the only judicial union and that it is a minority.
That a minister is so committed to supporting unions shows how useful they can be.
The union you cite may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great in the Chancellery, it's no secret.
One wonders now if the "mission" of some judges is not more dirty than instructing.
You should be satisfied, the SM is in the minority.
What are you complaining about?
Peony: you forget that the magistrates are not civil servants like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to impeach and imprison everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the most starved moron of fame realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone accepts their offer.
Many have used it as a stepping stone to start a successful career.
One Direction fills stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all of these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who is in fact one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all made the Eurovision contest, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else have competed in contests in the United States.
In the 70s and 80s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars of British television.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that’s what happens to most of the stars who don’t participate in the contests anyway.
There are few who, after one tube, succeed in making others.
In any case, most singers/bands can at best expect three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, only has fans in the UK.
His fame comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career.
In fact, it’s more likely to lead to a career than the typical path of rock, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar frimers who smoke weed in their father’s garage and swing three chords on a poem at the elementary school level will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before even releasing an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that veers rather quickly to racism, because the sacralist ethnologists present us these distant people as infinitely superstitious and kneaded with ritual bigotry, while most of their ways are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, by everyday practical considerations.
Except that you interpret imprudently in the opposite direction.
Yes, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is remembered to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article anyway.
It is deco ephemere to furnish the vacuum.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacredness still lives on.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw at the nettles interpretations not at all scientific that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparative critique of the disciplines to make us laugh a little?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, precious testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and archaeologists used to rely on their "instinct" and knowledge, and could be wrong.
Nowadays we have technical and scientific means so efficient that the interpretation of the excavations is better but can always be questioned by other discoveries!
One is there in full (and old) controversy on shamanism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (cf his book "The shamans of prehistory", especially the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published by the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
Do straight men like anal sex?
For you Mike, I could get started.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't go on with three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we're not against a play on that.
We couldn’t watch a musical about it, it would be too gay!
You could expect to have that kind of comment from me.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost complete, may I suggest you move on to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real, courageous journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own risk.
Rather than sneering at these puerile ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Go away then.
If these “childish ass jokes” shock you so much, you don’t have to participate, do you?
You also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is this the topic that shocks you, or the fact that people are laughing at it?
However, we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
Amateur video of the crash on the net...?
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no way those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the drivers, it would have taken out the safety car at the time when another vehicle (e.g. a dump truck) entered the circuit.
But we had to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it good to advance the time of departure (right TV, advertising, money ...).
But other than that, they protect the pilots.
I agree with you, too.
But there is also that if the very british FOM enters the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have at the restart a chance to beat the English who was then leading...
You are reading this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it doesn't matter, I have a little time to track down all your shit.
No, just no.
There have been a lot of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts stewards in mortal danger for a distant story of one pilot’s possibility of victory at the expense of another.
It’s not the FOM that brings out the safety because it’s the FIA.
Nuance of size.
In view of the amateur images, the lack of image above all allows the FIA to avoid the annoying questions of the type: How is it that the commissioner waves a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because we clearly see one of the stewards waved a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that we are no longer under a yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark misunderstanding of F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under yellow flag regime AFTER the place of the accident, hence the waved green flag.
This is the usual procedure.
The clerks post just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters as 100 meters after the accident) agitates the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal pace.
Sensationalism sells advertising.
I used to think that the media was an integral part of the government’s “patriotic” propaganda offensive, but I’m afraid that, in the end, it’s just for the money.
And sex, let’s not forget sex, the fear of not having a sex life, advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The news is doing exactly the same thing.
Making the buzz with information that you really don’t need to worry about is just to keep scaring people to be able to continue to control them.
“When tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch fear” It should be “derailed”, not “coughed”.
Given the medical reference, “coughing” is much better said in this context than “derailing”.
I wonder if all the people who are panicking that Ebola could start spreading by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You do them too much honor.
They probably think this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confuse Ébola and Murdoch...
Great article, thanks!
A short and concise article that beautifully and solidly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
That made me laugh.
It depresses me that the media is talking about most things with this upside down optimism.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and anxious (without getting into hysteria) for the government to make us skid when it needs it.
I think it makes perfect sense that if we have to go through a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it invented itself.
Isn’t there something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing through fear?
Congratulations for this post, and for being with this world almost 35 years later.
In the beginning, it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s and 1990s.
I am bluffing, living with the certainty of going through it for years....
Testimony perfectly useless.
As always when it comes to science.
Not only are testimonials useless: taken in isolation, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
Traffic: Testimonies cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps this is why we refrain from asking questions of psychiatric patients when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my psychiatrist mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's unimportant subjective testimony.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and the effectiveness of the new treatments) is useless in a scientific approach?
So what do you base your research on?
About fantasies?
Do you equate fanciful theories with facts (i.e., giving rise to verifiable testimony)?
"Resilience": the bogus word adored by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves for great psychologists after reading D'ansembourg.
Jim: There are a lot of empty buzzwords in the psyches.
Cyrulnik gave us the blow of “resilience”.
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he will have worked out a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company?
Doesn't that remind you of Team America?
Seriously, it's *not* a good idea to get the Sentinels out of the air...
And why?
It was a great series and it looks like those who come out of it are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the almighty who can work miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang on?
The only solution that comes to mind is pee-pee humor, which would kill the show.
It was already a children’s series.
The children were hanging.
Is it because it’s a children’s series?
UKIP works for the Mysterons.
Keep your Team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It will not be the same if we do not see the sons and the animation is well done. :-)
I can’t wait to see this (although I’m an adult), but I hope it will give a channel the idea of rebroadcasting the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped airing here in Australia; it’s been at least 40 years since we’ve had one-hour episodes on Saturday and Sunday at 6am.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-rate commercial channels and can still be seen at these times.
And in addition, half-hour episodes now go to 5:30, Monday to Friday!
Okay, I’m probably a “sad” 60-year-old guy, but I don’t watch this show every day!
There is no "Temple Mount" in or under the mosque of the esplanades!!!
Radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations under and around the mosque of the esplanades for several decades have not found anything.
The Temple Mount, if it exists, is elsewhere.
Could it be in Argentina?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which was built the esplanade of mosques.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, protrudes in the middle of the mosque of Omar.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to recall it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the 2-state plan, and scuttled it continuously!).
It is also good to show how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize His own?
The shortest of the Jewish jokes: "Praise God!"
To brag about tourism in Israel, we are often shown half-naked young naiads, languishing on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what the advertisement shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a wonderful piece of propaganda!
Too bad the Reuters photographer didn’t take a picture of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to retrace themselves on the Temple Mount and who prefer to stone Jewish worshippers below, praying at the Wailing Wall.
If this photo bothers you, it is right, it is not the newspaper or the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she transmits that must be condemned.
This system is not sustainable and will end up crying.
The only way to end this system is through revolution.
Since the economy seems to be spinning, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever greater remuneration to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of whining and moaning when someone else strikes, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not being bullied with impunity.
Unless we give up democracy, in which case it is tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you forgot is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Such as China and India.
All this cannot end well.
It's because we're in a democracy that it held.
Did you vote for TTIP?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by bypassing national governments through secret courts.
It sounds incredible, but that is exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people to the unimaginable damage this deal will have on our lives.
It is only recently that we are starting to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated behind your back.
Didn’t Churchill say “blood, sweat and tears”?
These are great benefits, while digital money has no reason to fall, let alone grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, in the 18th century there were unions in all the regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let it (at last, its officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe itself the safe of the eternal values of France, and it will fight and close its mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even if for her, it is more and more uncomfortable...
You still miss the indicat s of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I don't know what else.
If you don't write French correctly, I'll unionize.
You have been warned, it will be your fault.
For the defence of the interests of the class, the protected professions with trade unions are already suffering enough, which has created a rupture of equality with the other citizens.
One is asked not to laugh about the fear of risk on the part of a public servant.
One can very well imagine a system ensuring a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise disaster assured.
And with the carts getting ready, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance, indeed.
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject here commented on...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in Article 8 of the Preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker shall participate in the collective determination of working conditions and in the management of undertakings."
This is absolutely essential with the irruption of informational power.
And yet you have opened, probably read and commented on an article specifically entitled “The Great British Bake Off review”.
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it was Joffrey's wedding that I looked at, and I can tell you that some of them were well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (albeit misleading: it was the wine) in the history of television.
Also, mmmh pie...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a victory of the least worst baker; no one has been like “boom, this is my fucking cake now eat it and bow in front of your master”!
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and relatives outside has finally had an effect on them?
In previous weeks, all of these outsiders were kept away.
And there’s also the idea of “playing security, there’s always next week” that disappears the last week.
I love to cook, but I can’t imagine doing that to myself.
I am grateful to those who do and thus offer us great entertainment and push us to try new things.
Forward to GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year’s challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to make them and they had to tinker with one in 3-4 hours.
All three challenges were really difficult to decide, I don’t know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the slightly dry base (although I agree with Hollywood that the green icing on Richard's mill didn't make them want it, anyway Richard had already lost it at that time).
I must admit that several challenges in this series seem a bit artificial because of the time allotted.
There is also cancer waiting, with solar gales.
Certainly, everything is succeeding at the moment.
A bad time to spend for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there wouldn’t be enough solar wind to “push” ozone out of the stratosphere.
There would even be more, and therefore less UV and “cancers”.
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a bunch of useful functions that you don’t suspect.
If we limit ourselves to humans, they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks cancer-causing UVC and allows UVA and most UVB to pass through.
You know that you don't have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a lunatic when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was implied in the comment, which itself intends to show pedagogy.
Without saying that I am a regular of melanoma, UV only ACCELERATE its development.
They are not provoking it.
As proof: not all tanned people have melanomas.
Or, when a doctor tells you to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV is necessary for any human.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV rays directly cause melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And, more importantly, can we switch it to the mixer?
or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the purpose for which it is intended.
I think the military would need something more resilient and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as a front-line communication device.
But for us,
It's still a good choice.
The majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it.
Except for the Nokia 3310.
Specifically, is it already folded?
This joke is made in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke about folding that I read in the comments today.
It’s hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production line and it is difficult to see how it could come back.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed correctly and which is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things.
But, would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of a FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
Ah, the article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that manufacturers produce in « industrial » We put forward super u but all the signs and even the small business are concerned How to eat good, organic avac 1650 » (average salary in France)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After all, everyone is free to put their priorities where they want.
For me, food is one of them.
Go without grudges, I kiss you
We call bobos, or better, boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological “software” that causes them to disconnect from realities.
This is total unbundling thought-reason.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example claim to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartuferie, joining the left-caviar, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens do not tolerate this mixture of heavy ideology and tartuferie so do not be surprised to often meet criticisms about them.
Wow, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the associated details (airplane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't find myself there.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecolos are monoblock.
Do you understand the concept of the left-caviar?
Well you are able to understand the concept of the boboecolo.
It’s the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in greens at all.
The boboécolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of the ecolos because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look that giraffe in the face.
She is so badly made that she vaguely looks like a female nude.
Shh, you're next to the plate.
You have to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the astounding truth beauty of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to comment since you have not spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic ability.
This is *art*.
No, it's a pig.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
This is not really a proven fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are realistic reproductions of dogs smoking while playing pool.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is more than just representing reality.
If you’re just looking for that, a camera will do the trick.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you may prefer.
If it's that easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still plenty to save: riding activities, the number of Republican Guard horses or the status of generals who are no longer in active service.
Honesty obliges us to say that France is reducing its numbers, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Great Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operational without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, at a time when we are observing the weaknesses, the inadequacies of our defense tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuarization?
That’s what I said, look elsewhere where to save money but especially not at home, at home it’s really not possible...
This is exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where gabegie is certain.
Let all those who have been around the military thing dare to come and say here, with their eyes in their eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting out laughing...
Apply the same potion to the entire public service and public finances will get a little better.
And for Josi: really relax: look at the inflation of public jobs in other ministries and you will understand why La Défense can be considered a bit busy!
Well yes, the savings on which everyone agrees to say that they must be made, must be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls groan at the assassination when it happens at home, the poor darlings.
It should be done but especially that it does not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for the local authorities, history repeats itself with each closure of the post, maternity ward, hospital and barracks.
Everyone is for savings, of course.
It's weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and is not happy with the savings in public spending.
This is really the most amazing thing I have ever read!
That embarrassing moment where the first three people commenting make the same bad joke.
It’s depressing to scroll down her Facebook feed and see that 80% of her friends started their statuses with the phrase “That embarrassing moment.”
I think they're gonna make a movie out of it.
It will surely be based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus while going to work and realizes only there that his skirt is back in his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
Not really, in my opinion, the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and tighten his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a Kate Bush fan, the announcement of her return to the stage after a 25-year absence has been something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now in the middle of a battle over who will have the rights?
I don’t have the internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
God, I have to see this movie before I die.
I can’t believe how amazing this article is the most amazing thing I’ve ever read!
Charlie has just really demonstrated that he is at the very top of the top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I'm falling backwards!
It is imperative that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible brilliance and unsurpassable genius that springs from Mr. Brooker’s keyboard like a divine glow.
God, that was really bad.
Especially if they are not women or transvestites.
I am a parasite.
This shows a positive evolution within democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until further notice, we are being confiscated the right to save our planet by states that are playing tricks at every meeting to save the planet.
So we decide, citizens, to take matters into our own hands.
With the commissioner they planted to the energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away....
Wind turbines and solar farms are tomorrow’s Roundabouts.
All financed by the commissary.
Please stop this pro-nuclear talk.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the industry is not fully controlled, it is better to limit yourself to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided of course that we drastically reduce our consumption.
Electricity through renewables to fight against CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned at all.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions at production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity through renewable wind or PV is already more GHG on the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittency.
Replacing nuclear power with renewable wind or PV would go against the fight against CO2.
Christial I do not insult you I am Doctor of State in physical sciences 1981 more I did research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the contrary of what I said.
For what I did not say it is you who lend me ideas I did not say anything about Germany nothing in fact you did not respond to what I said and like all the right people demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I also quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German government: Germany’s current renewable energy program is an unprofitable and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you do not count uranium mining and construction and if you do not count water vapor greenhouse gas of lesser effect than CO2 it is true recall two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant shares in water vapor and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you referred to Pakistan as a “South Asian giant”...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
It's no surprise to me that most commenting Indians only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India a giant of South Asia.
I have nothing against some Pakistani players participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a Pandora’s box full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, with Kolkata's Athletico winning 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions India spends on IPL cricket and now on football, how could we ever compete with our “noisy neighbors”?
The low-cost launcher race is paid for in cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect only manifests itself with too cold helium.
So we may not be in a lack of design, but implementation...
Unlike Arianespace, which is a private company, it seems that Soyuz belongs to the Russian state.
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they will pay the satellites in frigates who knows.
This is all the more unfortunate as many media outlets take over the titles of articles alone - and many readers only retain these titles.
All in all, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Totally agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project when it is only a launcher problem.
