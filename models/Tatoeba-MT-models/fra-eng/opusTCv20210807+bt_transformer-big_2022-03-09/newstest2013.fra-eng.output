A Republican Strategy to Counter Obama's Re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of US governments promulgated new laws from 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on election day and deprive citizens with a judicial record of their right to vote.
Before the 2006 election, no state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to do so.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity document.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
Much more.
Students, voters considered to vote more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID card issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to do so.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
Republican lawmakers sponsored laws in 2011 that abolished voter registration on election day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state’s voters.
The same goes for Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, white voters who made up 76% of the electorate accounted for only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vigorously opposed legislation restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by Democratic governors’ vetoes.
The Attorney General of the United States has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have laws requiring the presentation of photo identification cards.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that were passed and see it as an obvious goal to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that passed these laws accounted for 171 of the 270 votes needed by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: take the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes present erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What make hesitate even more men already reluctant to pass screening tests.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another European study concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who were screened and those who were not screened.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that we are between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if we are not detected.
So I recommend the test from age 50, or from age 40 if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
There is a real need to make the patient understand the degree of risk of their cancer, by offering them options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect life in the long term, and by opting instead, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
Increasingly, criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated are being determined with precision.
I still recommend taking the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine if you should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of APS testing.

Prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50 percent," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This is very detrimental to people’s health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
The weight
Overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to CCS.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular physical activity for a lifetime protects against colon cancer,” it added.
Food
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
Too much of it increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Deli meats too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or curing can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," it said.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at this time.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to CCS.
While one of them saw a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also unclear.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Taking a screening test doesn't give cancer."
The Higgs boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir, last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worst" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it’s still not entirely clear whether it’s the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are holding an authentic new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, but data is still missing to be perfectly sure.
Let's suppose it's the Higgs, since the chances of getting it wrong seem slim, and let's see what it's all about.
There is, in this world, a fatally inescapable law that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
Even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it too has a law of this kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In a corner there are good citizens named fermions, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And in the other are the bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means they can be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, for that matter) The Particle Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not address here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, it must be emphasized here, are not all as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it “disrupts” the electromagnetic field in this precise place, much like a rock thrown into a pond.
From this "disruption" arises an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "force carriers".
More stable field
The same goes with the Higgs boson, except that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, one must reach very, very high energies, a little as if it were a frozen pond of which only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN's - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring 27 km in circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful in explaining the relationship between Higgs and mass.
Not all particles, not all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never stand on its own on a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, hold) do not.
Now, what can "bring" all this research, asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
Many of them are eager to find one, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and plug some holes of the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has huge deficiencies, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oops!).
But such discrepancies have not been found at CERN until now.
Impacts
The impact of this research on the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs. Tout-le-Monde is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
At the very beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser, in Bell Laboratories, had no suspicion of the revolution that their work was going to trigger.
They were looking for scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 -, initially the laser was rather seen as a "lab gadget".
Imagine...
And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his optical work.
This sensor, although not at all its original intent, now serves as an "eye" to all the world's digital cameras, and earned it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This doesn’t mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, really, you never know...
Palliative Care - The Best Way to Die...
With its Commission on Dying with Dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is set to resume shortly as a bill is prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that gnawed at him had left him a respite of two years.
"They had given me five years to live, I was seven years old," he said, half-fig half-raisin, lying in bed at the Victor-Gadbois hospice in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for that,” he says.
Illness does its job: a huge weakness that prevents it from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, talks to strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicines, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My greatest wish is for people to cure me of diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In our lifetime, we learn that a man pisses standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Restoring to the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“It depends on the person’s ability to accept regression,” he notes.
Because, in the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this point, the “team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides so-called “curative” care.
For 89-year-old A., the worst fear is to die "conscious and suffocated".
But the disease made me discover my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
“I don’t have any wishes in life anymore,” she says, before accepting to be put on a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, however, she awaits a final visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, body care and food assistance are provided with a group of volunteers.
It is palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when you know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether in terms of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
To the dying, we will agree to provide mouth care to the brandy or Pepsi, according to the request.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help loved ones as much as patients," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow each other but are not the same.
Next to a 93-year-old old man enjoying his last family gathering in the courtyard, snug in his pillows while toasting in his honor, a 36-year-old boy is tragically dying, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after trying everything to survive.
“For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds that are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Access to Palliative Care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Greater Montreal Hospice Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec health care that makes several doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care leaders including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to show their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone will have the right to quality palliative care before we agree to proceed with euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room, in great pain, without doing what was necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients are only asking to die because they are not receiving the right care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are scrambling on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard’s survival expectations were already minimal when she gave up trying chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she said.
She told me I was finished!
Not almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank the caregivers for not having acceded to their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Palliative Care at the Greater Montreal Hospice Palliative Care Society, patients are reported to be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which is equivalent to putting the patient to sleep until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear this part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: “I want to die.”
But it doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me,” it means “I want to be relieved.”
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell day after day what they know about a formidable “system”, mixing the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
An "industry" that has cost Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has been crumbling since we took the big means," ironically Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec City and former police chief of Montreal.
It was through him that the scandal broke in 2011, through a thorough investigation into the wrongdoings related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister at the time, Jean Charest, had only given his consent backwards.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, hidden party financing and corruption of civil servants.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he points out, the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars on contracts,” some curbing their instincts to receive a quota!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, hoping that it manages to "demonstrate the stratagems behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also works with its army of auditors, investigators and government analysts.
Plus the police of the "Marteau squad" who, since 2009, would have led the "cartel of the sewers" of Montreal to put the pedal soft on the swellings of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly pocketing bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Also formally charged are Montreal road engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambiato.
The latter caused a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who donated the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito sowed wildly in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
He also admitted to having organized an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal deputy prime minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts whose costs he inflated
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked well.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, detailed it well before the commission: in ten years, he received gift building companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling $ 736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road officials have confessed to getting their paws greased by inflating bills by 30% to 40%, by fake extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget feeding his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected officials in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million to developers, in full real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be set up, she says that she "shoots on a wire to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and pin the culprits".
The process, she says, is “painful but positive.”
We are cleaning up the wound, but it would take a Montreal-specific investigation unit and a watch, so as not to see questionable practices coming back.
Just like we do the housework.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially worried about the role of "elected officials aware of the ploy", when they were not immersed in the trick!
Estimating at 70% the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he laughs: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but this will not change the situation, according to him: "As long as we do not strictly limit election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics."
He calls for a complete overhaul of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "We can not go further; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow to rebuild the house on a more solid basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh about it to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I progress by their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And, in a match, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not inflamed.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine training centre to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress in stages.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s rookies are used to playing some very high-level matches.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right man?
Sure.
Ancelotti inspires respect in all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won many titles with elite clubs.
He has played with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a heartwarming conversation with him.
I came out of a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my performance.
What are your thoughts on the first half of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of leader.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the round of 16 with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
Now anything can happen.
But we will have our say in front of very good European teams.
We want to finish first of our group, ahead of Porto, to be able to receive in the 8th of final return.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the long term.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, PSG is giving itself the means to make this project come to fruition.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win the title of champion.
Last season, we didn’t go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we are supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it’s the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It is normal that we are expected a lot from us in view of what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
After that, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame, it’s certainly a bit frustrating.
I wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we could be there.
Look at Manchester City who have not been able to qualify for the last two seasons, they have also made huge expenses!
With regard to the sums invested, we imagined you with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were “boosted” by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can have a smile by saying that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s exploits.
So much the better if we say that there is a "Zlatan addiction".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and has a lot of goals.
He came for this and he proves that he is the star of Ligue 1.
He showed everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grabbing game time.
I saw things there and came out stronger.
Today, I can make good matches in the selection.
That’s what I’ve been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine and today we must behave in an exemplary manner.
What are your thoughts on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the head of Les Bleus?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the draw (1-1) won on October 16 in Spain a founding match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current currency exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from peer to peer.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to 2 dollars, five months later, before returning today around ten dollars (the prices are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “in competition with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as “credits”, used to progress in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, each time, a central authority controls and processes the exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both account book custodians, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually done between two email addresses in the manner of an email.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double key encryption system.
This allows the network to verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist in the public book of accounts, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, and whose winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a hashing phase of a file, that is, transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hashing" the whole thing.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to defraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, which leaves margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also met with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had its ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposits stolen.
“The flaw used is not about the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the potential for money laundering through this anonymous service.
Cash also has this defect.
Prominent actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant sales" were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, believes very much in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The holder also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement among merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
All they have to do is communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to win, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to re-evaluate the various risks, now considered high, if this currency succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow suit by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, as in the days of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes helped by local insurgents, these will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was in order.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked, overflew by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban surge in Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghan women paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants who were overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The leading figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmen, seizing government land and selling it as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracts.
Most of them did not fight on their own.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have taken advantage of American largesse: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have been around the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they have appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys alike.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or the corruption of certain leaders.
All of them, including armed opponents, are fond of cell phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas that present a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting provincial militias, which will escape the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization, like the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and well before.
No industry has been restarted, no dams are in repair, no major irrigation systems are being repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
There was widespread rumour that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that Westerners were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on site, nor means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to excavate the huge Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, will also have to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: high school for girls, boys, department of French at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a service of "civilo-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, has carried out, and had carried out by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, greedy in local labor, were able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of arable land.
What will we leave as a memory, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very hard in these valleys often located at more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, which the farmers have told me they want, a small, well-controlled and directly affecting civilian aid should be maintained in their favour.
A Constitution at the Forceps in Egypt
This is another poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it full powers, it has decided to play its all-out.
Taking everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State gave this Assembly two more months to complete its work.
Egypt has been relying on a provisional text for almost two years, several times amended, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal blunders.
This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "betray his word" and "peet the law".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end as quickly as possible the institutional and political crisis, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy while protest is raging throughout the country.
Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote favorably, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since this recourse to a hasty vote is due to the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I keep the full powers", these are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals missed the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing that they had not been able to assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society had done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 substitute members were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were voted on.
Some commentators were amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee believing that the pendulum of the constituent was badly settled.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, has 234 articles.
The object of all attention, Article 2 finally remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their good will and their respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy,” respond the liberals, who see it only as a communication stunt.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, particularly in terms of verifying the compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of a theocracy.”
The fears of the Liberals are further stoked by the fact that the next president of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulamas but academics, for some trained in the French system" tempers Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used borrow from religious vocabulary.
It refers to "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ed].
And the question may arise in the future as to the extent to which civilian judges are competent to rule on it.”
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extended powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime.
Another contentious point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will trials of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as human rights groups have called for.
The latter also express their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, there are no more articles that echo the protection of women, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak last night on television, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the center of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and wilderness.
Argoumenty i Fakty has chosen five main reasons to visit Israel.
Go and worship the holy places
A must-see: the banks of the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who penetrates these "baptismal funds" will be touched by Divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm or where the fishing was miraculous.
It was there that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk along the Street of Suffering or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the Antonia fortress (the praetorium), where the trial was held, then led by the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the Unction and the burial.
This is where the Christian center of the world is, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest place of the Jews: the Wailing Wall which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave small words with prayers that are then answered.
Travel at a height
Visit the ruins of the Masada fortress, an ancient refuge from enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are found on the steep rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can go there on their own.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
The old beliefs are that pagan gods once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
Impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth a visit.
First: The Israel Museum located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the very old Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
It mainly exhibits the paintings of the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of casts of visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin’s sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which looks back at the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the Children’s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Stars are shimmering.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
Israel’s three major resorts lie on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the temperature of the water does not drop below 21 ° while that of the air can reach 23 °.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The azure water contains brine and very easily retains bathers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of surreal beauty.
They come to perform a treatment based on salt water, silt, curative sludge and to treat different diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of Antiquity
They are guarded by Tel Aviv’s old town, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk through the narrow alleys that bear the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds who have come to do photo shoots of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk in the Roman theater, "conquer" the fortress of the crusaders.
During the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, because they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It is almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturdays.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturdays, markets, shops and public transport cease their activity.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels only serve kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hummus, traditional Jewish dough, different sauces, balls of ground chickpeas, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that walk the haughty air.
You can see them at night sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
These cats love passing places and do not refuse to be regaled.
Car rental varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Who has a language in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists are debating what the law on compulsory language testing will give, fraudsters selling “false” certificates have already appeared in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since 1 December, a law has been in force that stipulates that every migrant worker will have to pass a Russian exam.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, in time, promises the Federal Migration Service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the History of Russia and the foundations of law.
You will have to validate your language skills in Russian to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Persons who obtained educational certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not covered by this law.
Benefits, Negative Attitudes and Protection of Rights
The network of examination centers will be under the auspices of Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions of Russia.
Immigrants will be able to take exams in all cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what is it going to do?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, say the representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery at work".
Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers, says Victor Sebelev, director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan.
Protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, says Sebelev, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "journey" in an overcrowded cottage where he and dozens of his fellows will torment each other for months without food and paper and will have to work between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"At home, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they take their passports, and they do not receive the expected salary," confirms the Head of the Directorate of Migration Services for the work of the Migration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, Mr. Policeman!
However, many citizens of Central Asian republics who wish to come and earn money in Russia say that they not only do not know the language of the country they wish to visit, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even a fair primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children, let alone dress them properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It’s hard when you don’t know the language, they say.
“You feel diminished and diminished.”
Human rights defenders, however, note an important aspect of the language law.
The exams will be intended only for migrants who have a legal status.
Without status, there will be no formal examination or work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbid to come in"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then, one can get a fake registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have registration, hence the cases of extortion.
“They ask us for 100, 200 rubles, enough to buy cigarettes, tea,” said Umed Khushkadamov, a national of Tajikistan.
“Make quick, do not skimp and buy yourself a beautiful work of art.”
From the first day the Language Act came into force, it was discovered that it was not only the migrants' registration papers that were found to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Falsified papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: each migrant who hoped to facilitate himself the task of the examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Government officials and human rights advocates agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these “paper ends.”
The authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination at the first glance time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market.
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to tighten the law against civilian weapon bearers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: from the shooting at weddings to the killing of seven people by Moscow jurist Dmitry Vinogradov.
The police want to ban the wearing of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a gun license from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced in the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is happy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "squeezing the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demand to abandon "this insane hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasiliy Lesnikov, a BBC lawyer and crime specialist, told the Russian service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1.168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that strengthening civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from sourcing from the black market.
According to them, one can find today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior says it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black market for weapons is supplied through several channels.
There are five main canals, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served for ten years at the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot from a site taking orders from weapons
The first is the "military trace", i.e. the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
“These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians,” Baranets said.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stocks and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often suffered explosions.
"Attested versions indicate that some fires were deliberately started to conceal the deficit," the former military official said.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers have something to do with it.
"We see private weapons factories that do not compete with competition on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," said an expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A significant proportion of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply," adds the former soldier.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts have estimated the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Studies for Public Administration.
Specialists analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal files and public data from weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the military and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found there "because of employees whose work is related to weapons," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from “clandestine searches”.
A seller and consultant at an armory who asked to remain anonymous says that for a long time no one buys the weapons found by these clandestine search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, the sellers will look for the new goods in the military warehouses.
The person buys through a sign a unit, for example a TT gun.
It is delivered by passing the goods through a wire mesh.
"He transports it to town and sells it for $900 per unit with two chargers," he said.
“It’s true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be elucidated, they make a check purchase from illegal arms dealers,” he added.
" Like in a luxury boutique "
The seller and the buyer are usually found through acquaintances.
I looked at sites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to Begovaya station where someone was going to take me to a "corner" to haggle.
The price of the gun, I was given it on the spot
Victor Baranets as Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, says the salesman. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are vendors in the markets, but there you also have to come by saying for example "From such a person, who asked me to convey that his daughter has lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of someone I trust.
He only delivers them to me because he knows I won’t give it to him.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former militaryman Victor Baranets tried his hand as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, according to him, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was "anything we want".
“I thought I was in a luxury shop,” the soldier recalled.
There is no secret to the buyer, Baranets explains, you can try anything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, we go with the seller in the forest and we set up a target.
“I’m allowed to shoot and when I’m convinced that the weapon is working well, we start negotiating,” the expert said.
A shop from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, we do not need any documents and no one to meet.
“You just have to have a precise amount of money,” the company said in an advertisement on its website, “Buy a gun or a combat machine gun.”
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to the miners?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"Buy TT. Moscow," writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of fake sites and picks up people who want to buy combat weapons.
People rush over food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves mining coal in Siberia

I have heard of this type of schemes: usually, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People are taking over.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"In return, he receives a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, secretary of the association "Right to a weapon".
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, you can find yourself without a weapon and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of fake sites and picks up people who want to buy combat weapons.
“People rush to food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves mining coal in Siberia,” he said.
One Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a gun", one can buy a Makarov gun for 100-300 dollars.
It will take about a month and a half.
It came out of the long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the official data of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes overall decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles while the cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
US: Fast food and supermarket workers on strike
Nearly a quarter of U.S. teens go through a cashier job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has mounted against the low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow or run out of steam quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Along with the modest wage increases for basic workers at Walmart and in fast-food chains, the organizers of the protests want unions to be created.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
Protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday," as a pouring rain of sales took hold of millions of people across America and sometimes triggered glare.
On that day, some employees of the company Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs to organize pickets with unions and left-wing activists in the company’s stores whose products are aimed at consumers in the modest and middle classes.
Walmart markets everything from diapers to shotguns to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paid Walmart employees shop only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheaply, especially because of the low salaries of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" protests demanded a pay rise, they complained that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
For the basic Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour, that’s a sum he can’t afford.
Scientists at California’s Berkley University show that if Walmart raised the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
That’s 1.1% more than he currently spends.
If Walmart were to shift all the wage increases onto the shoulders of consumers, every run in the store would cost them 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did no harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8:00 in the evening to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over this period 5,000 items per second.
Its caisses have completed a total of 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".
Company spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs and that the protest was just a "com operation among many" on the part of the organizing union.
"Next customer!"
Protests continued this week in New York and were no longer about Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not much appreciated, which is why they are not yet established there) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s advertises selling billions of servings and then they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you for the work you’ve done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast foods increase them over time, but on average, its core employees earn $8.90 an hour in New York City.
No one touches less than them in this city.
It's inconceivable for me to live with that money in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with that salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum there are comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know what you are going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that fast food cashiers and cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, a multiplication of more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union protesters with harassment or dismissal.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, grabbing fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary staff turnover.
They don't agree
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the mid-day rally near McDonald’s in Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: “McDonald’s advertises selling billions of servings and after they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you for the work you did honestly!”
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, including Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said, “We all need to support fast food workers to get the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times described the event as the largest in the fast food industry in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not to mention that not all of them were fast food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult to say at the moment whether this spark of mass movement will make small.
"At the moment, we can only moderately fool the brain"
Lately, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was revealed that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it is clear from the interview with the director of the 3D interactive technologies group of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the moment with pixels on a flat screen and sometimes with touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today sells without Kinect because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although the Kinect made the physical interaction, a lot of things happen on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information capture has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance, for now, not really.
We’re trying to change that and we’re working on truly 3D imaging systems that run on different technologies, including projection technologies.
It is necessary to bring the computer world out into ours, into the physical world, to make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it.
In this way, we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let’s get rid of these stupid virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think of the voice command?
It’s appreciated, but isn’t it overrated?
One cannot say that this is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of one's actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to control the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discrete, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-worn bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can?
You would do it with words and gestures.
- I usually only talk.
- Oh, it's going to be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine may or may not be doing at some point?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify the reactions of humans.
This can be laser sensors, for example, and they produce a fairly good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what don't you like about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be nice to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are pretty good, it adds work to algorithm designers.
We must keep in mind the resolution along the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, gave the touch of the sensors a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 seconds, with the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device of this type in my work, but not needing to touch, to have more frames per second.
Shouldn’t we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem.
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to the Kinect, play with the curve of the cameras and see how it could help define the locations.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most perspectives?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone with your hands up is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be a "transient" augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch from glasses to smartphones.
Glasses are a very personal device and this is what makes their strength (the personal elements are the ones you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is a problem to which the opponents of this idea point the finger: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands feel nothing.
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
At the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image medium.
It perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are really intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasound rays directed towards a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the sensation, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the tips of the fingers.
There are also wristbands worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a work axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think that he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
There’s still a task down there that’s going to take a long time: how to make someone who’s physically in a very small space believe they’re walking in an almost infinite open space – we’re working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we can only moderately deceive the brain, there are still many years of work.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The Reign of Taste, Not Culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Petersbourg avant-garde" dedicated to city dwellers who are ahead, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors of the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city’s border and who have found recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the outgoing painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in parties and trendy openings.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always bring crowds together, no matter where they are exhibited.
He is one of the essentially social and philosophical Petersburg storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands an organ of Barbary and it became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since it had matured enough for this difficult role because of its existence, its philosophy and its image of bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you travel the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a designer specialized in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of images and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not gray arouses aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my works were located.
I understood that this was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, like me, were misunderstood.
I began to befriend the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevshchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
- It was important for me to be at the center of St. Petersburg culture where the best creative forces have to come together.
In 1995, I took a seat in Pushkinskaya-10, which was home to a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the bohemian Petersburg.
Many were born there: The NAME, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in playback in tight-fitting jerseys, among them Igor Vdovin, a composer now in fashion.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg hosted quite a few shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his training and basic education, it is with us that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees left as regulars.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named Painter of the Year, and that’s when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it’s easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong topicality and acuity.
I'm going to have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum Through Clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it scares me to be that way.
But with the clowns, everything fades away, the tragic falls.
I like the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give her a hand, but we should spit her out.
And the lie will be effaced by the disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the Barbary organ player. - A cultural city must have this type of hero.
Who else but me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art must be neat, delicate, sweet.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into herds, the supporters of Bohemia loved one thing, denied another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I’m not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you'll like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we've thrown who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and at the end of the day it is less management, money, everything is gone.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with paintings that are usually those that are painted at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is the spiritual culture, the consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money precisely for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the reign of the good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow today there are good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who might be experts, but they are being sidelined, because there is a need for higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and make their way.
Currently, it is the "reign of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find themselves other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our stones, art has a hard time growing.
We need a cultural floor and we have more writers than readers, that’s bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
With us, this layer is very thin.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with earthlings on board set off in search of a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how to keep our species alive in weightlessness or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much to choose from.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
“It’s about Venus and Mars,” says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500.
You can only live at very high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then, insects, small breeding Drosophila flies, were put into orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo grew in weightlessness.
At the exit, we get a perfectly normal chick.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a support, it has to get on its feet and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By finding no support, the chicks were agitated in a disorderly manner.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
"We widened their eyes twice, then gave up, because it's simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will only carry species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still about biosatellites and then it's the only experiment. You have to do this kind of research," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, it is not yet possible to make reproductions directly in space.
It's no small matter.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, humans are capable of doing this.
Homo sapiens possess abstract thought, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not done for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the female organism is the most precious thing humanity has.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold up after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the theft.
“Nobody was answering that question,” says Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, a retired rocket and space worker.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a baby girl.
The child’s father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been in orbit twice and even working in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Hydrology laboratory of the Cosmonauts Preparation Center: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train at extra-vehicular exits.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable but yet a foreign environment, for infants, this is their true element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
Since the baby develops about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's belly, it is easier for him to get used to the water.
This is in principle logical, because from his birth to his first bath, it takes only 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget,” explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if weightlessness is a more natural state for the newly born child, the woman needs gravitation, weight force.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, the pelvis atrophy very quickly, the ability to push the baby is lost.
Okay, let's ignore that by relying on birth simulators.
We can of course prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will manage to get him out.
"And then?" asked Poliakov, inviting him to reflect on this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the Earth's attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
One cannot dress an infant as an adult with a special suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely disadapted," predicts the Director of the Committee for Bioethics of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a theory.
However, over time this will become a reality, as the Earthlings travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the home of their space-born offspring.
The head of the ISC (Higher Institution for the Control of Public Finances) said: "The control of pseudo-self-employment (in Czech 'varc system') has failed because of the politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it lags behind in its implementation.
Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Institution, said in an interview with Aktuln.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but its enforcement must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking with us,” Kala said in her commentary on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the "varc system" by Petr Nesas.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not annoy contractors with controls, so is it allowed or prohibited?
“The law has to be enforced one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government can’t stop an authority from going to inspect to demand compliance with the law,” Kala said.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German project in which the public procurement laws of these two countries were compared.
What was it really about?
This is a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation, as well as a practice proper, follow it.
We have collected all this and although this control procedure is not yet completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "more severe and of better quality", nevertheless, according to certain parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to draw up ever more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to devote ourselves to the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project concretely help you and what does it mean for you?
This kind of joint monitoring should help us stop trying to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when it does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering market thresholds will not necessarily achieve this goal.
It could be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork that those who seek the loopholes will find many more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our SAI or a different mode of organization?
As for the institutions, similarly to the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof operates there which is organized similarly, it also has a council constituted a little differently, but these two institutions proceed basically in a similar way.
The competences are also, to a certain extent, similar, but with a certain nuance in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has accounts of this type at the level of the various Lands.
HRB can only control federal money, which is the same as government resources.
The public funds managed by the regions and the municipalities are controlled there at the level of the courts of account of the Land.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, but in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but surely it cannot be said to do better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I do not have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we consider to be a model, also faces a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage in cooperating with our institution, right?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has the amendment of the Public Procurement Act meant for you as an institution?
As this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we carry out post-clearance checks, we have to deal with a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the moment, the process of preparation of future controls - we have launched a new instrument of "detection of risks of mismanagement" with which we have screened nearly 14,000 public contracts - there these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been modified as well as the conditions of certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
Do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that can arise is that these rules become more severe and it is not possible to respect them.
Already under the previous regulation, the provider (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced the subjects under control to accept that any breach of the contract law meant a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it really worth making the law more severe in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse it but not punish those who make formal mistakes without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS was not going to annoy entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called “varc” system – what does that mean?
Is the Avarc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect and demanding compliance with the law.
He can say, “We’re going to change the law and allow it,” but he can’t say we’re going to act like nothing happened.
The law on contracts contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out and this, precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
The roads are in places frozen, but most remain passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowy.
However, the network remains largely feasible, in some places with increased vigilance.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the area of Karlovy Vary, the roads were this morning passable, but in places frozen and also snowy.
Temperatures have dropped and are hovering between -5° and -10°C but they are expected to rise slightly in the day.
Snowfall has stopped in the area and only a thin layer of snow remains in the plains.
The ridges of the Metalliferous Mountains (Kru?né hory) are however covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
Data from the regional road maintenance service indicated that, due to fog, visibility was reduced in some areas.
The R6 expressway and the national roads of the region are now passable without difficulty.
However, vigilance remains to be exercised, for example on certain bridges whose coating can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
Remains of frozen snow remain on some of their sections and in places packed by traffic.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to increase their alertness.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Krilové
The Roads and Motorways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in East Bohemia are threatened by the formation of ice and that layers of traffic-packed snow can be found on roads in mountainous and high-altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in high-altitude areas of the Pardubice region.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanukroun, Orlica, Poliska, Svitavy or Vysoké Màto, mainly on departmental and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoe) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Knanou and Trutnov, a layer of traffic-packed snow is present on the roads in the high-altitude areas.
In Eastern Bohemia, it will be overcast with light rain today.
It will blow a weak wind and temperatures will generally fluctuate between -3 ° and + 1 ° C.
Region of Pilsen
Roads in the Pilsen area are now passable, although in some places it is necessary to be more vigilant and adapt your driving to weather conditions.
It is freezing this morning, temperatures hovering between -3° and -9°C.
After the last snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communication routes may be in places frozen.
Drivers can expect to pass through areas of fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is apparent from the information of the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway can be reached almost without difficulty, however, road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The surface of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections may be frozen in the South Pilsen district and in the Tashkent district.
The departmental and third category roads are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers need to be vigilant, especially on the less traveled roads of the region.
Region of Olomouc
Drivers travelling to high-altitude areas of the Olomouc region now have to deal with a thick, soft layer of snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the pass known as "Ervenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlské kô, after the chemical processing operations.
Snowfall forced road maintenance personnel to the field last night; according to road services, it fell more than three centimetres in the district.
In other parts of the region, most pavements are passable without difficulty.
“On the heights of the district of Sumperk there are remnants of snow.
Drivers driving towards Jesenuk should expect to encounter a thick, soft layer of snow at the pass known as "Ervenohorské sedlo"," the head of road maintenance services for the district of .
Their colleagues from the Jesenak district also visited the site during the night; according to them, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are passable without difficulty, in the district of Oternberk drivers should however pay attention in the sections in forest areas to the roads remained wet.
Regions of Oest nad Labem and Liberec
As of this morning, road maintenance services in North Bohemia have reported several difficult stretches.
According to police data, in addition to some places covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn?nice na'stecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, so snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially south-east of the central Bohemian Plateau, there are, on the contrary, no problems and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic problems have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services have reported the presence of ice, especially around the city.
According to meteorologists, the nocturnal conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and melting snow during the day, clear skies and frost during the night.
From the main roads, there are also reports of difficult conditions on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of Oest nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of traffic between Telnice and Kninice is due to branches of trees that have bent under the weight of snow until reaching the roadway.
Ornest said: “In concert, we want to collect positive energy.”
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh rather and we think that we are the only group able to collect a remnant of positive energy in order to repel or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December, you will be putting on a very unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
This is a charity that we have been preparing for two years now.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20, three concerts will be held simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end almost at the end of the Mayan calendar on the island of Kiribati, which is in the Pacific Ocean, on a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who had this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap along with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world called "End of the World Cancelled" (in Czech "Konec sv?ta zru?eno").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will we hear it also during these charity concerts?
Of course, at the very end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
The anthems will also come together at some point as part of a completely unique live broadcast of Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomo Hanok who also plays the main role of Jesus in the music video, Xindl X also sings there...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charity events...
We strive to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What are the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training center, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we are working on as part of the Jedlika Institute, with the Tap association, and that for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedlikov Institute and offer them activities that interest and amuse them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlika Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several bands and performers take to the stage at each of these concerts?
By what criteria did you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere will perform with Dan Borta, The Tap Tap, Marion Bango and Jio Sucho.
Full details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other such “mega events” in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; here too, we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once there in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not as bad as it sounds at first.
We have five members in an electric wheelchair whose gear must travel in the hold, naturally we also trim a lot of luggage and instrument boxes....
So far everything has been more or less always going well, the British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, from where we returned recently, everything went smoothly.
Through your travels abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of accessibility for people with reduced mobility, public opinion attitude towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that in the east all are still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very inaccessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to travel alone in an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
How do we still have to catch up with more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and refinements always depend on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is still not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and easy access is one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have famous sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers among us.
At the moment, these are just isolated cases of people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlika Institute, where I found myself surrounded by a lot of young people willing to invest in something.
And since I myself am a musician (I play, among other things, the saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator L'a Angelovic says, we lost a little bit of control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in the last few years, if I'm not mistaken?
That's right, connecting with well-known singers and actively working to promote the band helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it does not exist in the background.
Thanks to subsidies from the European Union, we can, in addition, afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was potential to change things.
Show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: anything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take pity on.
They are people who can live a full life and flourish, provided they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities achieve something, it is not only a step forward for them but for society as a whole.
Isn’t your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many areas and demand some discipline.
But I think it's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and their heads in the clouds, and when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
Only one, L'a Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come in and go, we can't help it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case on the eve of the scheduled day of the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 pm.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, in Brno in Fleda and in Ostrava at the Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
In the late evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world canceled " will be sung jointly.
The aim of the concert is to gather financial resources (to the tune of 25 million CZK) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training center located in Prague in the Jedlika Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years old, the pre-sale of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the Cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started a close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the following years participated in a number of ESA projects.
However, Poland’s journey to space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the lecture given by A. Aternfeld at the Astronomical Observatory in Warsaw on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his pioneering work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the listeners cold and years later Eternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 he won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his book "Introduction à l'astronautique".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became a great exponent of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a world-renowned astronautic propagator, his contribution was notably rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the far side of the Moon.
In 1925 a draisine was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket should be used to propel or brake the draisine.
The only known information about this draisine is that of the press of the time.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to focus on rockets.
The research was carried out by the Komorka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the retained documents that this search had reached the testing stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search stopped.
In 1937, plans for a photoelectric hunting rocket, designed by the engineer Rohozicski, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects using rocket technology were carried out by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war put an end to its activities.
After the war, further work on aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is talk of a company in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Probleme, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicz, it is proposed to create a society devoted to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to join the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and in the autumn the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the weather rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version, RM-1A, was built, and in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were started in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket was 1.4 meters long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was halted.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded the first RM-type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a 0.4-liter space, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of craft was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Mention should also be made of Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimor Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
There was a lively public discussion about this decision.
It is undoubtedly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means that the different economic entities and national economic systems are in perpetual conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of free trade and the free (unbounded) movement of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of labour (wages) generate a tension on prices.
The following meaning should be used: a producer endeavours by importing goods sold cheap to resist economic competition by "making more expensive" the competitor's price, with the aim of removing a greater share of the market and thus increasing his own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, buy cheaply, or disappear. The result is significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social burdens of the State necessarily increase.
All this situation intensifies the perfect bad will of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole of society by this race for profit.
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in the different economies a situation in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments are putting their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to force economically its own population to accept the diktat of prices of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This occurs on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and on the other hand by the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
The result is growing poverty and deepening differences between the rich and the poor.
In the FRG, for years there have been public food distribution points for the poor who cannot support themselves with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the State is forced to pay a supplement so that they reach the minimum subsistence level.
For example, such a scandal has been uncovered in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of practically all the southern EU Member States undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or to live with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
The question is: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media argue, tired of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital fiercely defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence and even, today, does not direct, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same token, the entire State.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof of this is that there is an almost all-powerful lobby present in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits in legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable.
In the FRG, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the drafting of laws to law firms closely linked to industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
The totality of power does not come from the people, as the Western-style constitutions declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that democracies oriented towards liberalism are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his work entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State had long been in a state of decay and functions were attributed by violence.
Blows of bribes, favors obtained illegally, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The under-tables and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with votes already sold"... ... "Honest people did not seek to obtain functions, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls".... 'It really began to say that the cure for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man. "...
In conclusion, as in antiquity, present-day society is founded on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interest of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and asserting the interests of society as a whole.
The result, today as in the past, is an unprecedented decadence of elites, without any effort to carry out in-depth reforms.
We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future casualties, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long run.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at the international level and at the European internal level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution is socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investment in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
“Nothing will ever come out of violence and never can,” Sting says in the song titled Fragile, whose main line in the chorus is “let’s not forget how fragile we are.”
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be,” said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild’s wife on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, there have been many reactions.
Some side with Israel, asserting its right to self-defense and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and viewing Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is victim, in its waves of recurrent killings; all in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view “behind the curtain”, on the one that mainly benefits from the tensions that have persisted for more than 95 years (from the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for study, others emerge from my own understanding of the one, or more precisely the group of individuals, who is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
In each era, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals were acting independently or whether they owed their acts on the throne to someone who directed their acts according to previously defined objectives.
We have to admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers could not have been done in a single generation.
Among the families possessing astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
As early as the 1990s, they acquired the world’s leading news agency (Reuters) to stop linking their name to serious criminal acts in which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortune or both.
They own major stakes in almost most of the world’s central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such stakes (prior to the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq by 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi by only 4, in the meantime Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up to this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild Bank of America's status as a central bank and began issuing his own money during the Civil War (government, I mean) and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
JFK began issuing clean money and wanted to dissolve the Fed; he was assassinated in 1963, Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 as he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Economic Crisis of 1929.
Their worldwide lust for power led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a three world wars plan by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to abolish colonialism, especially British, and the third would reduce the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing more than the beginning of such a solution) and, in the end, acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the wealthiest families led by the Rothschilds is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to prevent crises like those they provoked in 1907 from recurring).
After successfully starting World War I with the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of World War II, the bankers let the politicians create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed on Germany enormous war reparations thus generating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (it is then enough for them to place a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing the finger at the culprits, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of a strong minority of German nationalities.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (returning to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the foundation for a mass emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had initially held him; or if everything he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the sufferings of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel lit a fire pit that could cause a Third World War.
If the international bankers manage to start this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (just see how hard people divide themselves between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong causes another wrong in an endless circle of violence and where one finds, at the origin of everything, the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
Here we have to differentiate between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as with us, the international bankers only propose to the people in the elections their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascistic politician, loyal to the international bankers, who is doing everything in order to start a war with Iran, which could, due to the country's membership in the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand to become a world conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz through which the entire world's oil transits.
In what light now appear the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of finance aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
Let them compel all individuals, great and small, rich and poor, free and slaves, to wear a red-iron mark on their hands or foreheads, so that they may neither buy nor sell him who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood: that he who has common sense counts the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number designates the man and it is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters made up of Islamist students stormed the US embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, a blow further aggravated later by the fiasco of the attempt to liberate the hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before it was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated events, they found themselves in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran thanks to a fantastic cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who came to scout for the filming of a big science fiction show.
Combination of genders
Exfiltration expert Tony Mendez's plan required Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictitious production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistically conceived political thriller but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, a treachery - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirty.
The atmospheres follow one another: documentary-style Tehran sequences (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no big differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the hallways and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting ceased to elicit ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It’s also Affleck’s first film that doesn’t take place in his hometown of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where Tehran’s role is “held” by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real events; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity that also suggests the confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake film crew in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to settle for a subject that actually offered few thrilling scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
He does very well, he sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is dismissed by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the airstrip are pretty far-fetched).
Argo's weakness lies in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood cooperators, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he lets himself be seen with moderate interest, appreciating the direction and retro style of the 70s.
It draws the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story still, in a way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it does the trick.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts a public inquiry every year on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the contest of the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
“The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, adopting a quota of 40 percent of women for the management of large European companies was at the origin of our decision,” said Patrik Nacher, the organiser of the survey.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women have benefited from life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of the "EU workshop".
“The vote will take place before the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance, or the hen cage size directive, which has led to higher egg prices.
Criticisms have also been made in the past of the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimetres in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or a group of states (for example, the Czech Republic currently imposes the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto power).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, at the root of the fact that in the Union bananas must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curve".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonising non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
Fruit and vegetable standards have been relaxed despite opposition from some states, claiming that existing guidelines result in food wastage.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to last year’s EU regulation that requires inflatable balloons to carry a warning that children under the age of 8 should not inflate unsupervised by adults.
The EU referred to a U.S. survey that found balloons were the leading cause of child choking deaths among toys.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when it comes to blowing in fair trumpets.
At home, too, we have weird ideas.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must, instead, speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "Laissez Faire" association of liberal economists, the Bankovn server named in this survey, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes set for canned mushrooms and thus risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found it interesting to pay money to certain countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to apply for subsidies.
However, these ideas do not come from Brussels but from Prague.
“The fact that we don’t have a sea handicaps us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund," said then-Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (SSD) in the autumn of 2004.
He argued that, as a result of our wheat production, and following the so-called interventionist purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks that it had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to Czech demand and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
The grants for obtaining grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), which was to be used, in concrete terms, to draft applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "Bizarre regulations are rare".
While regulations often attract criticism in Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning and in the field of its overall development are rather worthy of praise.
More serious is, for example, according to experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which were imposed by the Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a struggle from which it does not always win) arouses strong emotions among the Czechs.
If after six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvaruky", as for the name "Tuzemska rum" which dates back to our home in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemak".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, and not on beet sugar, may bear the name rum.
In the official EU list of registered products, you can find today in the company of world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, the marzipan of Lubeck or Parma ham, the biscuits of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carp of Pohoiselice and of Tueboe ("Pohoiselicka a Tueboesk").
Gingerbread from Pardubice ("Pardubick" pernak) and cakes called "Cornets de Hosice" ("Hosické trubiky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Mr. Senator, how do we get the idea of running for president?
It’s not about being a senator or a president that matters to me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer bear to see how the country has been looted for the last twenty years, that thieves are not locked up and taxes and the age of retirement are rising.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I try to find a way to change it.
And since I am over forty years old and I am independent, a member of no party, I have no other solution to influence the situation than to run in presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but you quickly set out for the Castle.
Aren’t you turning your back on those who elected you?
I've always said that I'll get into the battle for the Castle based on the results of the Senate election.
Later, I made it clear that if I were elected a senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument allowing me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we grumble at the bar or in front of our television set, but also that we trample on those who try to bring about change.
Added to this is the press that breaks the reputation of people and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it has been said about me that I bribe journalists or that I have been the adviser to Jia Parubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You started the fight for the Castle with the themes of material and criminal liability of politicians and retroactive tax declarations beyond twenty million [of CZK].
To that end, you must change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, lobbied for tour guide activities to be a liberal profession, I won my case.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take from each side what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you think of yourself as a right-winger or a left-winger?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are putting me rather to the left.
For me, whether it’s a little bit left or right, it’s not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left-wing or right-wing but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS, and I also act impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you are a populist?
But does not what you said prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have been talking about it.
But without the support of the parliament, you only have slogans left.
You won’t survive long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I must convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my side in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then eventually explain why they don't want it.
When there is a strong personality who will identify the abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the election of the president by direct suffrage, it was obtained through the pressure of public opinion.
I admit, without hesitation, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just got into politics and I'm trying to get the majority support for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to get things done, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It’s a bit like Okamura having to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can make a difference, which is why I went to a number of personalities to ask them to run for the Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Janaura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I have at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencova who exposed the fuel oil frauds.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what did, for the most part, gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are just two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if every potential member's past is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I also have no money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand in my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You’re talking about tax returns, what’s yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property at about 60 million.
I have in Prague a plot of land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million in my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid’s dream: I’ve always loved James Bond, who drove, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have a $60 million estate and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don’t want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I've already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I do not have a sponsor shows that my program does not arouse much interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign out of my own pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the compensation I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't afford it, like paying for my son's English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I would not run for office.
So you will continue your commercial activities to be able to live?
Didn't you say you'd mute your activities?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially curtailed my activities.
For example, my assistant will take over the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I was winning and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Pruva.
Architects at MVRDV prove that true adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To be convinced, just look at Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a nearby large company, tells us: "Yes, it is indeed beautiful, this building".
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one goes willingly to one of these rinsing libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeper town that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The 80,000-strong municipality has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore a few neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro notes in the form of pretty miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to regain control of the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of witty and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and entered the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on his face.
And while the jury members were still looking at each other, bewildered and shrugging their shoulders, Maas, the cheeky, piled up his choice books in order of size to make a pyramid, and ended his speech backed up by activist arguments with a: "common dear!"
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros has sprung from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and some buildings and terraced houses for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is how this small, dull town, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a town hall with a bewildering ugliness, whose white facades invite us to think that they are home to a dairy, has been enriched by a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under a cheese bell.
Certainly, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you tread the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The entirely glass interior is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant street lights speak unequivocally the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public benches, dogs and little boys and girls who play ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally the library shelves are along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,” Maas says.
We completely upset the classic spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books has been skillfully arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes panelling, sometimes balustrades, sometimes stair ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened architects and building engineers don’t want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found in a frisonne agricultural company an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, one millimetre thick synthetic membrane has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we're saving time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, and then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and potted ficus.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute above all to the maintenance of the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain air.
Gifts for the New Soul
“It’s incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books lies below a glass bell, the sun only illuminates the interior for a short time, even on good weather days.
The thick wooden beams mounted crosswise with respect to the glass facade serve as sun visors, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
Fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was also there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "soul at last found."
A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure made it possible to fill the voids of the library which was not yet completely filled (today, it counts 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing on all sides.
For architect Winy Maas, “there is nothing worse than a half-empty library.”
“I believe our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it’s just for decoration.”
This is how MVRDV achieved the master discipline called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
She may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a bigger role."
Germany chose abstention in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians’ request for observer state status at the United Nations.
But then she chose abstention.
Why not?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but was not overly critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen abstention in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany find it difficult to take a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so to speak defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans faced several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still groping to find that role, but are on the way to a “more normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
What does the term “normal” foreign policy mean for Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions that are independent of those of the United States and European partners, including on national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the Middle East conflict and its abstention from the United Nations vote?
First, Germany has important markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a determining factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, because it is not an exclusively one-sided relationship.
But this is at least a determining factor in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany harm its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that the Europeans and the Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think the divide is not so severe as it was in the case of the Libyan issue.
Germany may even be more respected.
Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government can of course not defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at Obama’s relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you’ll notice that Obama is far from over-enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think that makes things any easier for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore be part of a wider political line and must assert their unique position.
This is what they are currently doing on the issue of the euro.
In my view, Germany will take on the role of a locomotive in the future and push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of its relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that further marks their independence.
Does Germany see itself as a major player on the international scene, does Germany only want to take on a key role?
Or is she still struggling to take on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we notice that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German sentiments are heard.
It doesn't make things any easier for the Germans.
In fact, it's always the same problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to deal with neighbors and a wide variety of opinions, and that's not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European politics is only diminishing, but at the moment, the EU is not filling this void, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they do not like it, even if it is unpleasant to them and if they are only less appreciated, it is life!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the undertaking bearing its name cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, it is not certain that she would win the case.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer with Taylor Wessing, a law firm that specializes in property infringement in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Impersonators only need a few extra letters to be able to register their marks.
So instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sporting goods.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet containing the registrations made at the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the champions of the world of copying and intellectual property infringement.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell virtually nothing but counterfeits.
Pattloch’s cases, however, are different: his constituents charge him with tackling the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women are designated who marry rich men.
Chinese officials say they have nothing to complain about.
“It’s bad for business, we have to fight this trend,” Pattloch demands.
“The brand is watered down, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is huge.”
The financial losses and legal costs are in the millions for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to expensive flagship products.
According to data from market analysis company CLSA, China is the world’s third fastest growing luxury goods market with an annual volume of 15 billion euros.
However, it is not easy to delete questionable registrations from the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reports on the trials in which the court dismissed the complaint, because after a long period of time, the criticized denomination had become a “market reality.”
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist because he would have harmed his mark in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought concrete pump producer Putzmeister.
This is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Volvo's buyer Geely used a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of BMW before, but the conflict was resolved and Geely had to change it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost to plagiarists from Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the famous crocodile’s gaze in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO trademark office in Beijing admits to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would have gone last year from an "emergency situation in the course of work to a restored normality".
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have reportedly been closed, an increase of 75% over the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the Office.
Acting is expensive
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the agency, this is a record and it means that China is at the top of the ranking for the tenth time in a row for the number of new filings in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal trademarks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the agency reportedly recorded 1.8 billion yuan in registration fees.
In other words, each record brought in an average of 1.280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Certainly, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components to be suspended.
However, the impersonator was able to maintain his Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
“It’s our fault, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany,” says Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office had therefore rejected the Munichers' objection.
Freudenberg won the case in the following two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is required
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "the procedure is long, trying and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs, and the archives department has even had to review the actions of the past hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a "big six-figure sum" to settle the dispute.
“That’s how we see what it means to us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to spill over into Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region ensured the exploitation of the unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit Freudenberg’s name in Germany for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it was still able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "vigilance is in order."
He and Pattloch advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international trademark law, rather foreigners should “register also in China everything that is likely to be protected”, as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay licensing fees to the opposing party for the use of his own name, as Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we would lose our place in the segment of the market in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir is rehearsing in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland are looking forward to their arrival.
Here is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, you tap your foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, ladies' pumps and men's moccasins look for the rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly amplify - alto, bass, tenor and soprano -, they carry on, bewitch and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he conducts the orchestra with his wildly supple gestures.
It's Monday night, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty singers from 23 to 69 years old have come, from the geneticist in human medicine to the man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each chorister has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Being Helped to Help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per person, you can become a sponsor.
This money guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "storyteller" or "singer of praise".
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this area, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany to now return it to its native region: Southern Africa.
For 8,733 kilometers as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of straw or earth and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has taken their parents away.
In Esitjeni, we can observe on a smaller scale the evils that plague Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland’s population carries the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in their mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis especially saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
At first, it was only a few people who personally committed to paying a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But barely a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that since then has been almost professionally caring for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies belong to parasitic STIs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhea often appear in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is the cause of at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea, and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany; however, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
Among youth, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years: from 1.967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been declining.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white discharge, pain in the lower abdomen as well as the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms may decrease the risk of infection, but they don’t protect 100%.
The reason for this is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricating infection or through close bodily contacts.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who changes sexual partners often take regular exams.
Most STIs detected quickly can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but especially to the funds that the singers collect thanks to their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
“In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well housed, in one of their grandmothers for example.
Gogos, which are called old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them take in up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and ensure that they go to school every day on time in their uniforms.
The orphan who has no one left is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chicken coops. With the help of the American health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many inhabitants.
This is not self-evident, because even if the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His 14 Wives
“AIDS is a real taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it’s a topic that touches on sexuality.”
This is quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned mores, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
Condoms are found on every street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh.”
In order to encourage cultural exchange, Imbongi's choristers travel together every two or three years to the South of Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still know during the apartheid era.
The bus full of white people singing in the African language is such a sign of recognition that it not only generates good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears a tear at some formidable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godsons.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
“Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there,” the people there say.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometers as the crow flies, back to Heidelberg, in front of these choristers who hit the foot in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Strasse, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of ice cover in the region of the planet permanently plunged into the shadows.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one makes a connection between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other life-saving elements arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Undiscovered inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like small gaps through which we observe the infinite.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail from an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of the countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborns" in the delivery room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope has discovered this region where stars are born, called "W5", a not very romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA’s Spitzer Telescope has photographed the blazing glow of a dying star.
The doughnut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, a cluster of stars also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope highlights the colors more.
In this infrared photo, the Helice nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to a terrestrial continent has earned it the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo makes it possible to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the Spitzer telescope’s infrared detectors were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy is the creation of the rings of Saturn.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the galaxy of the Tourbillon.
Depending on the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three trails of dust divide the glowing heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic pile-up in the constellation Serpentaria: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies rush towards each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Southern Fire Wheel".
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and is made up of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than common household dust.
This photo was developed from the optical and radiographic photographs taken by different telescopes.
We can see the circle of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope has photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the Rosette Nebula, also permanently create young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe that it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror in this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is huge and the mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economical construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its large capacity of light collection.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to those of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extra-terrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help with Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) by harnessing the computing power of their machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Mauna Kea Hawaiian volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory which observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new gigantic telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration makes it possible to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been giving us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for exoplanets, essentially those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo shows the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The mission of the telescope will be to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that Mercury’s South Pole is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury's North Pole.
Radar data had been pointing to the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
With the launch of the Messenger spacecraft in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain.
Drink butter daily, and live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is one of unbridled romance.
At the bend of the many turns of the road, the small bus cahoots along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, it almost looks like in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group called Talysh lives, about which little is known, except that they speak Persian and Azeri perfectly and have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town with its overly aggressive Soviet-era architecture does not agree at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one lane.
The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Bakou became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision contest, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva said.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
We can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh of the region who are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
This is my grandfather, he's reached the age of 120.
Still have a child at 136 years old
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd, who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when it is thought that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of Muslmov seems more than doubtful.
“He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973,” Fatulayeva said.
The man is said to have married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he still conceived a daughter.
Would M?sl?mov have been wrong for a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the man of the early Central Asian age.
“Surprisingly old people also live in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old.”
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the non-existence of the documents, not to mention that there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
It is, however, a fact that the people of the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks that it is a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a bat, whose content she beats tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two small children are also in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped armadus glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf hide long braids of a dark blond that her son reveals to us with pride.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and they kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo,” Mirzayeva adds.
The monthly pension is enough to live on.
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my whole life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she told us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda astonishes in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the nation’s father figure, a man who nevertheless ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not experience distress.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (about the same amount as in euros) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s long-grey son is right: “the elders enjoy great respect in our culture.”
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The “rights of man” omitted in the Constitution
The revolution was reborn in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the country’s deep divide.
The draft constitution based on Sharia law is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not stingy with words full of emotion.
We have to make the transition.
"And this achievement is my responsibility to the people and to God," he told state television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but also especially for Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
Because all members of the confused and hopelessly disunited opposition are afraid.
They fear a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Morsi said, almost apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own “in order to save the revolution.”
However, Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles hastily written by the predominantly Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour nightly tour de force are indeed disturbing to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word “principles” really mean?
It was and still is a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal leeway to apply a stricter interpretation of sharia law.
In any case, it is suggested by a newly introduced article that al-Azhar University should be consulted on all matters relating to the Shariah, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance shines throughout the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus, which would de facto result in the judiciary being placed under guardianship.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts worked to suppress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values.”
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
In other words, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, there is no specific provision guaranteeing equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Equally questionable is the wording implying that it is forbidden to “offend people”.
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft that Morsi submits to the vote and which, in his own words, will "very soon" be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution Reborn"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the Islamists’ numerical superiority.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, promising to bring down sharia law before it comes into force.
“The revolution is reborn and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said the draft constitution is “to be thrown into the dustbins of history.”
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi supporters of wanting to foment a “putsch against democracy”.
“If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and we will overthrow him,” said Jasser Said, an opponent.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated,” Khaled Ali, a politician and opposition member, told Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not in Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of Cairo University.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
"Cleanse our country!" they asked Morsi, saying that "the Koran [was] their Constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir Square, where everything began, would very quickly have generated a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, this is what Morsi’s supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft constitution, as well as its supporters, had spoken out loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide through the ballot box which direction the country should take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
“Human rights are not mentioned once.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood while in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That is why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
“And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution,” he regrets during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto taking away all his powers,” Saeda said.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, who watch the battle between different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could be paid for.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway’s rakfisk: is it the most fragrant fish in the world?
The five million people who inhabit Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the locals' appetite for an extremely fragrant fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway’s most popular dishes.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a duration - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When darkness sets in and it’s cold, Norwegians gather in droves to attend a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
“You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit,” says Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter who is also known as “Rakfisk General,” who runs the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and put on a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,” Havard adds.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it’s not bad – it’s reminiscent of sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in barrels of airtight water, then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - undoubtedly with the senses diminished by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - over 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to come and work.
Rakfisk is seen as something important, a vital, though fragrant, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you $10 each.
Norway does not often feature in international news, which is not to his displeasure.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about the "July 22 incident".
The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country one of their own could have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
“But oil is not the only reason for our success,” says Anna, our waitress, with blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk platter in her hand.
We are - how do you say - prudent people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything except a small percentage of money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw the money out the window, in the years leading up to the international financial crisis, Norway kept its purse strings tight.
“As long as you can ski in winter and hike in summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
“Not to mention the rakfisk,” she adds in a carefree laugh.
I stand under the snow and queue up to buy myself something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a burger composed of elk, a real discovery, it's excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I am staying at is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where one can vote for the best of them – or perhaps for the most fragrant of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a bow tie, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of the fish fumes.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a tough start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC is interested in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, which are many.
Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a safety dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, the results of outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the throes of a drug war that has already claimed the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. president, Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A very populous and sprawling state that encircles the capital. In his preferred land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in everyone’s memory.
The locals attribute it to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city you can take one of the new highways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of crevices.
Plaques bearing his name hang outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We are counting on him to bring about lasting change,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and of Mr Pena Nieto’s party, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country so badly needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace in Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects critics who accuse the new president of lacking charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo couldn’t be more glaring.
Hidden under the highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military was called to the rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a disaster area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the past two years have been found on the edge of the landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez – a place infamous for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to stem the problem of murders perpetrated against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me photos of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version mentions a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family believes she was killed by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed,” says the Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the cadaveric rigidity had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a whimper.
They want us to accept what they say and keep quiet.
“But it’s not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new president has made a promise that he will make it his priority during his tenure.
“I hope he’ll be as good as he was when he was governor,” Olvera, a member of Congress, told Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter Bradley Manning's claims of abuse during detention.
The trial is about Manning being held in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to dismiss the case on the grounds that Manning's detention took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to show on Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of being behind the largest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. military -- missed many opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Maj. Ashden Fein claimed that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a motion demanding that the Manning case be closed on the grounds that the detention was in very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide while in custody.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At Friday’s hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms officers had filled out after meeting with Manning, during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison segregation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment his guards had given him was “excellent” and that the treatment he had had at the prison was overall “very professional.”
There were no complaints of ill-treatment on the forms, although officers questioned him directly about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had verbally expressed concerns about certain issues and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the issues raised.
“They wrote ‘no problem’ (after addressing the concerns), and yet that didn’t mean I didn’t raise any issues,” Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment during a January 2011 interview with the special commission that met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to have his restrictive status changed to indicate a “risk of injury.”
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close monitoring for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was fine, and I wanted to be stripped of that status... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my perspective,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the Marine Corps base military prison in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered committing suicide while in Kuwait and fainted once because of the heat.
He added that the fact of not being kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage,” Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 9 p.m. and sometimes more than 11 p.m. -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were a mattress, blanket, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
He tried to stay in motion because sleeping or lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint about Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other detainees one morning, during the call.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he had inferred from his guard's order that he had to let go of his cover that might have hidden his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to let go.
Manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the night before, as he allegedly tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underpants or flip-flops to hurt himself, but that he had not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account his experiences during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence should he be found guilty in a court martial, a trial that should be held early next year.
The defense said Manning plans to plead guilty to the lesser offenses and fight to drop other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning has been detained in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to national defense.
If all charges are upheld, he is liable to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that Mexico-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two ways: one for the Mexicans, another for the Extranjeros.
I remained motionless for several seconds, not knowing which line to go to.
I grew up in central California, where I was called the "Mexican" all my life.
It’s an ethnic qualifier, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves “Irish,” or my friends in New York when they call themselves “Italian.”
Then I became Mexican-American.
But here it was Mexico.
And on the land where my grandfather was born, there is no need for a special qualifier or a hyphen.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a Native American, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed for the "Foreigners" line.
I thought about that time of the week when Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama in the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide further details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory in writing at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans are undermining their neighbor's sovereignty.
And Montezuma's kids are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want us to talk about bitterness?
There are a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree, a person, perhaps a relative or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And more often than not, this person matched a typical profile -- dark, uneducated skin, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we are living the American dream right now, that we have gone to good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that this is the American dream that we are living, and not that of Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We grant it to the United States.
On the other hand, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocated.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they kill us as if we were individuals of lower stock and not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we wouldn’t find ourselves stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally emigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because Mexicans claim their identity more firmly and Mexican-Americans are upset about it.
Although she is a U.S. citizen, she feels part of two countries.
On the other hand, many Mexican-Americans I know do not feel like they are part of one country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to further complicate the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as makeshift ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a beautiful country that must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the pervasive wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're going to have to manage on your own, amigos.
That's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still resent them the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is yet another failure for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is in vain.
While the same futile arguments persist about who started, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has shattered everything, and whether we like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Still, there is every reason to think that it could help them get out of this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Although the ceasefire agreed on 21 November is still in place, this week’s fighting has strengthened supporters of the force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to give up, even if Gaza has suffered a beating.
Having killed some of its leaders and pushed Gaza’s 1.7 million people back into one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a burgeoning regional power, once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has stood up for Hamas; as has Qatar, one of the Golf’s wealthiest and most dynamic states.
Hamas members gloat and say the Islamist crescent bends around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where Hezbollah’s militia exercises dominance, through Syria, where Islamist-leaning rebels can topple Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on Israel’s southern flank, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders rely more easily on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be ruled out even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel’s hard line will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been boxed.
The Iron Dome missile interceptor system proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears – for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America is renewing its unwavering support; and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest wave of violence.
But above all, Israel prospered, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although rocket fire from Gaza has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared suicide bombings, including thanks to the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality under international law.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more hawkish party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, has the beautiful part.
Why pamper these damn Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they ruled the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out their head.
Perhaps the hardliners will win; but the Arab Spring may be a game-changer.
Even if Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to secure a ceasefire, which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is bound to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel – much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are exacerbating this problem as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic value.
Both sides need to be pushed by those on the outside.
The answer remains that advocated by reasonable people on either side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a cession of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to advocate for this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to end the flow of arms to Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the establishment of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal of a pseudo-state at the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has a vested interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packs have come into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover the dark green packages which are all identical, regardless of brand
This law, which came into force in Australia, is a world first, with logos and colors replaced with a dark olive green and horrible photos of sick organs and depictions of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small print on all packages.
It is the strictest system in the world for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to deter young people from smoking by removing any glamorous portrayals.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99 percent chance that they will never start.
“Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image,” said federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that found, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess.
While Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on multinational profits, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has lobbied against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said it would boost black market trade, which will give easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
“There will be adverse consequences from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said the law boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to hide the horrible packaging, has risen sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain’s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in Australia’s high court.
Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 of them to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only boredom, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the target demographic of the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV ads, sports sponsorship and the requirement for retailers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned web advertising by local businesses and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
“If you work in tobacco marketing and you only have a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the go-to place,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions from some ordinary citizens in favor of brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves whether this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has bothered to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulations in place rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court rulings - these countries told the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said the government has held discussions with other countries regarding similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make warning photos on packaging mandatory in 2001.
Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I don't know.
“You take a cigarette and put away the package,” Victor El Hage said as he bought a package with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm going to be arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in central Sydney, said the uniformity of the packaging made it difficult to store the packages on the shelves.
“Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours,” Yu said.
"The government only had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's okay, we stop and we put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to think about the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to keep you entertained (not to mention duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts specializing in child development are praising boredom.
It’s perfectly normal for us – and our children – to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even nurture creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'll come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But that’s not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of “Boredom: A Lively History” (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes back a long way," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After scouring numerous publications and submitting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of "wanting to do something but not being able to engage in a satisfying activity."
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although they would like to.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is “the interruption of the attention process, associated with a sullen mood and the feeling that time is passing slowly.”
Boredom can strongly resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while the two may be related, people who are bored tend to think the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think that we are bored when it is actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” which was published in the journal “Perspectives on Psychological Science” in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an older experiment in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, coming from the room next door, the too high sound of a TV show that had no connection, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or challenging task, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
On the other hand, when performing a boring task, “like looking at objects on a timeline, music can help you not get bored.”
In fact, he says, now we know that when you squirm or scribble, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to giggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay still,” Fenske said.
We all get bored one day or another - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Stage of predisposition to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes affirmations like, “Of the tasks I perform, many of them are repetitive and monotonous,” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Using such a scale, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need many and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly jaded.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
It found that 32 percent of teens reported being bored at school and during homework at home, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not in school.
In contrast, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentages of boredom today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that “teenage is a time when boredom reaches its highest level,” especially because children and teens don’t have much control over what they want to do.
If I ask, is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
In contrast, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
“Ennui is the way the brain has found to let you know you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at the N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn’t always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play the guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t get bored anymore, but he won’t have learned to take care of himself or self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And “this self-regulation goes from one situation to another,” he says.
Your child not only learns to be entertained, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don’t think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside the constant bubbling that activities and technology generate is the goal we should strive towards.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frantic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy downtime.
“In an environment where we’re constantly hyperstimulated,” he added, “it’s hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops.”
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana pellets and a pipe used to smoke them.
Orozco said one day, in September, he and a few friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was given a subpoena for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his consumption - minor offenses, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date to appear.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is there one?
In the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado’s vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on location than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offenses involving the use of marijuana have been classified without further action.
Police services have stopped charging adults 21 and older with minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative ridings have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to charge people who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana sales businesses in their neighborhoods.
“Things are moving so fast that I don’t know what the future holds,” said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora’s chief of police, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators are also asking quite a few questions.
They are seeking guidance on how to install a licensing system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - by the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most states when it comes to marijuana regulation, first when it comes to therapeutic use and now when it comes to personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Smith acknowledges, can do more than suggest what works.
“There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves,” he said.
The Washington law, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, during which the licensing system will still not exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain unanswered: how to balance the state’s mandate that guarantees proper access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the establishment of cannabis retail outlets within a 30 km radius around a school, park, playground or nursery.
“There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up a licensed cannabis sales business, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Cannabis Legalization Center, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates in Aurora sent an email to his officers announcing that the City Attorney would no longer prosecute people 21 years of age and older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that police should stop charging people for this type of offense “for immediate effect.”
Chief Oates said police would enforce new court rulings that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, the District Attorney, Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to take care of marijuana possession matters, primarily in order to pressure users to be detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to prosecute these individuals who committed a crime that, at the time of the crime, was a recognized offence,” Buck said.
Reactions have been complicated even in rural places like Mesa County, where voters have rejected the marijuana-restricted initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, are no longer summoning adults for possession of restricted quantities.
County Attorney General Pete Hautzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to dismiss all marijuana possession cases.
“I don’t feel like I’m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of voters in Colorado supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and governmental framework for personal marijuana use is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
“This is a cultural barrier” with prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and speaks as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They’ve spent a good part of their lives suing people who used marijuana, so they have a hard time accepting that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are poised to become a case law case for legalizing drugs.
As advocates and state officials foretell a new border of legalized sales, they are anxiously awaiting guidance from the federal government, which still views the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of marijuana legalization hope that the Justice Department will yield.
Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and vendors, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses to operate in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it’s true that police aren’t likely to break down doors to grab small packets of drugs, it’s a safe bet that they’re opposed to licensed personal-use marijuana businesses authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana businesses, even if it is only a one-year postponement.
Last week, the city of Montrose secured a 6-month moratorium, and is expected to impose the ban next week.
“We don’t want to find ourselves in a situation where someone gets a permit and then we’re faced with a federal problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the community vote rather than the state vote.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied and expelled from Oxford because I was a Tory.
It’s not just today’s students who are being attacked for their opinions.
For as long as I can remember, I have always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place of knowledge, a kind of Greek amphitheater of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I objected to the fact that undergraduate students were having sex in the bedroom next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson stated facetiously that I had left after being forced to drink from chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I had been bullied and constantly bullied.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, nor because of the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for only one reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about it today, you might say.
Well, recent studies have found that a new generation of center-right students suffer the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students at Oxford is such that last week some of them demanded protection of their rights, along with those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s Student Hall (JCR) said they were “often isolated, attacked personally and felt unwanted” because of their political views.
They want to have a representative on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which portrayed the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among them was the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who travels in Rolls-Royce, sports a silver suit and travels with a chrome-plated cane.
In other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as scapegoats for setting up tuition increases.”
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that “there is a growing left bias in universities.
People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who moved a motion for more protection, says such a climate is “uncomfortable,” and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right.
“This is an impediment to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as the well-being of members,” she said.
I was the only one to think this way during my first weeks at Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, I was then 18 years old and paralyzing shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was full of Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students got to know each other and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen next.
I discovered that teachers not only participated in the sarcasm towards Tory students, but that they also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy of striking miners, privatization and the government’s opposition to the apartheid sanctions in South Africa was carved into the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I experienced was a translation of 18th century French texts into English, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I've lost my footing.
Pitt, a little man with a pustular face, was easily carried away.
“Are the Thatcherists refusing to learn French or are they just stupid?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons in your free time - well, if you're not too busy making friends," he said.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that evening, I sat alone and then felt a slight pat on my shoulder.
It was a second-year student of English studies, named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, kindly.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (Conservative) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your dad is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most young Torys claim to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Ms. Thatcher had said.
This ploy failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political science, and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students took up the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
“How do the Tories make love?” asked one of them.
They beat each other, don’t they?”
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I have lived a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I have become Labour and renounced my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who was teaching at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents’ home in London, finding refuge with my more open-minded family and city friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was incredulous.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he told me pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the dreamy-bellied city.
Even my communist friends had irreproachable manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
During a guided work session the following week, when another history teacher suggested the most seriously in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Internally ashamed, I admitted to being the victim of my parents’ brainwashing and called them “old fools.”
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who broke the last nail in my Oxford coffin.
At that time he wrote two columns in Murdoch’s press each week.
My door was locked.
I kept quiet in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a whiny chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be the victim of such bullying in a school.
The most tragic was that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoyed an unshakable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian couturier.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place of British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his fashion house over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il ignore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing by Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from the modest couturier of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet set.
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty.
“At least they don’t crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop music stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his cottage in Gstaad," says the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of past beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
Even so, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentinian model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charisma of the couturier.
Several years ago, after a parade in the Spanish Steps in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
You could see and feel his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, the food, the music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the week of Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
“He will never go out of fashion, because his creations are works of art,” she concludes.
Parade of Nobility
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He likes people well-behaved and with the biggest titles and they like him too.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a glamorous sixty-meter-wide podium that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade on the podium to admire a dream "public" wearing the main creations of Valentino, such as the tailor that had chosen Jackie Kennedy for his marriage with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a wool coat and fur.
Among this audience of models, we find names like Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of his customers say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It consisted of trousers, a shirt, a gillette vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift he gave me,” said Naty Abascal, one of the couturier’s muse.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimates our beauty," adds the ex-duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses, they are bright and bright on the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashionista Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Eventually, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a ruffled skirt, a draped strapless and a cleavage to fall.
“It was a dream come true,” said Rodrigue d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with timelessness,” explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the dressmaker's evening dresses with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories she carries".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the couturier thus calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with pearl inlays, twelve different kinds of lace and a four and a half meter train.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the haute couture of the end of the twentieth century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obsessed for years by the "know-how" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any spouse of his clients.
"His refinement, his calm, his neat and perfect appearance have always jumped at my eyes," admits d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
“He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him.”
If it's a princess saying it...
The Hardest Job in the World: The Human Mules by Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through the steep stone trails.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living carrying sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After collecting large sulfur rocks, which weigh nearly 70 kilos in total, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 meters up to the summit of the volcano which rises to 2,386 meters above sea level, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a turtle-like pace, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 euro cents for every kilo of sulfur mined.
Once at the top, they make their way between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and carrying heavy baskets painfully, they walk the 3 kilometers to the scale that a mining company installed a little below at 1,850 meters above sea level.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, we can tell, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) per kilo of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serves to whiten sugar.
“As we carry around 70 kilos, we earn around 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip,” says Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes him 3 hours and he finishes exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is three times what it would gain in the fields.
“The income of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” says the porter who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) a day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java to convert."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he spent three of his life defying danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulfur has already begun to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
That’s the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
“I’m going to work for another two years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French,” he said.
Wounded by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, he does the job of a mule.
It shares an unsanitary wooden house with other wearers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur does not stop gushing at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater by lighting himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who work on their own and are paid by weight.
In addition, they do not touch a penny of 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) of surcharge per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for the beasts, not the humans,” protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent porter who has been working at Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left college.
Able to carry up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, between 10 and 18 years old.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases ... to which are obviously added their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, 53-year-old Unainik can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat trail invaded by weeds.
“I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life,” says Unainik, opening his mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult jobs in the world: the one made by the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame this absence of children on career, stress and the cost of home ownership.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem implausible that these words come from an advertisement for mint pellets, but despite that, or perhaps thanks to that, the video spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like “Let’s put a polichinelle in the drawer” to make fun of Singapore’s birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way through this ad.
Creative director Douglas Hamilton said he wants to use the power of music to make people fulfill “their national duty.”
It is only for the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in terms of birth rate, so we felt it was a topic we needed to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things such as throwing pheromones or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, what could be more creative to solve this problem than making it a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singapore government does not take it so lightly.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favor of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservatism of leadership and strict social controls.
Singapore’s birth rate, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Division, says it’s due to “better education” and “a wider choice of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family formation,” she said.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and to the delay of marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound with barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially against Chinese who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons the Singapore-based party had its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on a country’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs, and immigration policies, Singapore’s example also has unintended consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, it has started to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as “shoe boxes,” that can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoeboxes” sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these homes are built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to developers, who were previously put in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small dwellings in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the center, it seems that they are not going to have much effect.
“People are very stressed, houses are expensive, just like education, that’s why people put it off,” says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
“But for me, it’s important to have my money and my time,” says another young man in his twenties.
Men and women mention their careers, stress, and the cost of home ownership and education as reasons preventing them from having children.
So while the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is in the private domain for children under 16 years of age?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers of broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeridico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, who were frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term “something very personal” on a personal level with “password and username” when they applied it to social networks.
“I won’t reveal my most personal secrets in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone,” he says.
On FB, I post cool pictures or games.
I also talk to my friends.
“I won’t share one of my photos or someone who would be a fool,” he said.
The young boy acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photos, nude people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are family.
Her mother is one of them, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just post them,” he adds.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends, fast,” he says.
He said he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
Nor will he trust someone who would recommend a stranger to him.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not knowing 20 of the people on his list of friends.
“I’m not worried because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to the young boy, no one made advances to him or asked him for his address or telephone number.
“If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would just remove them from my account,” he said.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today as cyberbullying are no stranger to the young boy.
A friend of mine has been hacked into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
The victim, according to Jose, did not close his account.
“He just went on a private profile.”
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account in a safe way.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or upset.
“Even though I know it’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that, to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information, but with the emergence of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she said.
Porras reports that academician Marc Prensky, who holds a master’s degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book “Natives and Digital Immigrants,” uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are they, children and young people who were born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we ourselves are learning,” she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, “because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what to disclose or not to publish or say at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so.”
“We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and teens is to use questions that make them think.
“Their saying not to do it is useless,” she says.
Then Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a picture of you like that of a friend you posted?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you’re doing in every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"Outside the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," she said.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and education advisor, says it is essential that parents read the terms of use of social networks conscientiously.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what’s allowed to be shared or published,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to talk to strangers.
UNASUR summit ended without Lima Declaration made public
The VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 proxies present.
Efe tried repeatedly to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially signaled that it would be disclosed after the conclusion of the summit, then claimed that it would be published at any time on the Peruvian government’s website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its content had been exposed by Peru’s President, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated between the journalists was that given by the press officers of some of the governments of Unasur who attended the appointment, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document leaked during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more important information.
Later, Peru’s presidency sent an email to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was President Humala’s speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Summit of South America-Arab Countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although this was requested by the press, it had also not disseminated the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as had been previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited as much as possible the obtaining of information.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague that decides a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Pisera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ’s decision to hear the pleas of both parties in Lima’s lawsuit against Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague.
“We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are bringing before this international court today,” Humala said.
“Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country respectful of international law, peaceful resolution of controversies, treaties and international tribunals,” President Pisera added, giving a handshake to President Humala, next to the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogota by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered seriously erroneous.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the rendezvous.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the action lines for 31 projects had been set between the South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of Unasur would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve access to medicines, access to low-cost Internet throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help increase our productive matrix and glimpse a better future for our people,” concluded President Humala.
“We have decided to focus on a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the cross-cutting axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador although he did not give further details.
Similarly, the outcome document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that this country’s electoral process will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and with good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through an ICJ judgment requested by Bogota.
"It's possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
“We are going to revise all these paths, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask to have a discussion with this country,” he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they plan to attend the inauguration of the country’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto.
Similarly, as part of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
“South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship,” Correa said.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should take the example of Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the 6th Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, told state television, TV Peru, that the Europeans "knocked each other out during the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but that they were now almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project of establishing a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian president has been in favour of the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of diminishing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we South Americans have all signed it.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not betray his principles, but on the contrary he respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected.”
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish justice system, which has demanded that he submit to an interrogation on his territory concerning an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish legislation allows for this to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s mental and physical health would deteriorate.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious,” he said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
“It affects anyone’s health,” he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the granting of a safe-conduct that would allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and he points out that he had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not negotiating with human rights, we are not using that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzon, has launched a whole series of proceedings before different European bodies,” he said.
“If Britain were to grant safe driving tomorrow, it would end.”
And if Sweden, as its legislation fully allows, and as it has already done in other cases, were to question Mr Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or question him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and made clear that what he did not tolerate was “mediocrity, bad faith and lies that undermine freedom of expression”.
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not malevolent or perverse politicians but bad journalists in the pay of greed, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this light, he welcomed the fact that this was not the kind of journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to continue the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay within Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "must stand firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality, "it destroys the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We have to solve them as a whole to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he said he was confident in the proper resolution of the maritime boundary dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and that it is “beneficial for Latin America to refer the matter to international bodies if the two countries agree to accept a judgment as firm as it may be”.
In reference to the possibility of his nomination as a candidate in the future presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to running for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 primaries, he would retire from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
“My political movement believed that I was the one guaranteeing this eventual victory, but we must accept this responsibility,” he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I would step down from politics.
If we ever lose, I will too.
“That’s my decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez’s new medical treatment in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolàs Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse of President Chavez's health," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when he was confirmed with the test result: HIV-positive.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, which the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take charge of his illness on his own and began to inquire about it and his relentlessness was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is, without a doubt, one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigmas.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him “because he was speechless.”
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, “exhausted” their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same", said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes as reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious disease and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a life-threatening disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of immune system assignment that patients present at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those not using drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those CD4.
To put it simply, this means that for someone who receives a positive HIV diagnosis at age 25, “as long as they remain under control, they will be able to live without problems until age 75,” the scientist said.
In order to put this progress in context, it should be noted that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS increased from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients identified on the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the past 12 years at least, we have never run out of drugs, the problem is that patients are coming to very advanced stages because they do not know they are infected, or they are learning it in advanced stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, for that, it is necessary to offer screening tests in a massive way, to all people who request it.”
Specialists and members of the State AIDS Prevention Council of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as do the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already carrying AIDS and suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor of common complications that is the most common.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they’re going to die and don’t want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die, it’s better that I have fun three times a week,” they say.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he has cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, through his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of the World AIDS Day.
Let them take the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and the better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they must know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message sums up the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, argues Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest thing is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "we actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packs of a hundred, that's fine, but the result is that even today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, says the journalist.
He proposes to reorient this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold at counters, but that they be found in public washroom vending machines and in places frequented by young people.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonzalez had replied when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
“This is not how sexuality works, the best is to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active,” he said.
The numbers in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State is the fourth largest in the country in terms of new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in terms of the number of HIV patients.
92% of infections occur sexually, 6% through the blood and 2% through the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for every registered case, there are 4 or 5 people who ignore it.
A U.S. court decision on appeal ignores the restructuring of Vitro Group’s debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, setting a bad precedent for all domestic companies with branches in the neighboring country and solvency problems.
So it seems that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the star-studded banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment handed down on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the North District of Texas, leaves Mexican companies defenseless against the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico’s top glass maker to sue the U.S. Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the case judge reports that creditors must register under U.S. bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit Appeals Court, sitting in New Orleans, says the main proceeding is formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing cooperation in international proceedings in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for Uniform International Commercial Law was created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro subsidiaries towards the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples here, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy had guaranteed.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in any case Vitro's creditors who fought against it in the courts of the United States, that is to say the "vulture" funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained a majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
Data omitted by the appellate court.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has faced since 2008 without stopping at the serious economic crisis facing the United States, passing on the costs to the country.
For the time being, the Gonzalez Sada family company will appeal to the same appeal court for the vote to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance claim will claim non-prosperity and require review of the lawsuit by a higher body, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the court") detailing Vitro's procedure under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, noting that it freed Vitro from the conventions signed by both countries to bring it up to the level of paragraph 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he pointed out that the country had complied with the United Nations Commission on International Trade principles, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which guaranteed fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they stun Vitro and they stun the country.
General review
The complaints of the unions of the Mexican Aviation Company against the ex-boss of the company, Gastan Azcirraga Andrade, were passed over in silence for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Union of Pilots Airmen has already encountered problems.
The body, headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morineau, has just filed a criminal claim against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has systematically denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to withdraw from the trust F/589 of the bank IXE 198 million pesos in the name of the Mexicana de Aviacion.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Administration of Hotels.
As we all know, Azcirraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They besiege the Dragon Mart
A group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society gathered at a Caribbean University amphitheater this weekend to approve the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the Southeast area in order to oppose the monumental project that is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead
The government has put forward a requirement of the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its English acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was done well that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, real estate developer Homex has entered the Stock Exchange market for 500 million pesos.
This issue of securities is the first of four issues for which they offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Birth of Competival
Integrated by IT leaders NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, a new consortium with the corporate name Competival has just been born, whose objective will be the Central and South American clustering software services market.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
Basketball globetrotter "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the field and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as large as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a brain hemorrhage condemned him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, national basketball team player, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros de Bayamon or as president of the basketball federation.
“I’ve worn several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 90s,” Reyes recalls during a visit to Primera Hora’s home in Bayamon, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my whole life."
Reyes doesn’t exaggerate when he makes that claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs that recall his unusual itinerary, testify to this.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves the most are those that remind him of his time as a player with the Vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
“It’s been my best years, the ones I’ve enjoyed the most because I’ve had the chance to compete in eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as a manager, co-manager or leader.
That’s a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), telling me, "I have a big player for you, he's two metres tall.
Do you want it?"
That’s how Mincy started, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended to me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win one championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He enjoyed the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his charges and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 Worlds, where we came fourth and we should have won the bronze medal if that Canadian judge hadn’t made us play the last game,” Reyes said.
Is the 1990 Worlds team the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as was the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we beat the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and "Piculin" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Tosito" Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world of 90 due to a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourrutiner replacing the suspended players by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this is Piculon Ortiz.
His statistics at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Piculon.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left for you to do?
There are some things I would have liked to see in place, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys only play in their zone and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when it is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for executives, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch clips from my time on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide as John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of avarice in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas."
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the ironic role he loved the most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, his press secretary Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he admitted to drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumour in the liver and had a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television in the role of an ordinary guy in the series "Jinny of my dreams" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and took her home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among her film roles are well-received roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the delightfully detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman enjoyed his greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and their loved ones aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Killed J.R.?", coined to fuel the suspense around an emotional episode in which Hagman's character is virtually murdered, has generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screens and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.’s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had got her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to intern his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
“I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R.,” Hagman said in 1988.
One should write: "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing".
Here's the one part he lost.
Victoria Principal, coprotagonist of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as a man "immense, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us, who have been lucky enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already finished for the second season and a sixth is in progress, the channel said.
For now, neither Warner nor TNT have communicated how Hagman’s death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who rose to fame with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the stages of the theaters of New York in the early 1950s and then served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoir Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
“I didn’t write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told reporters at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donor and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I restore their confidence, I come with them when they come to have surgery and after," he said in 1996.
I try to offer them a little comfort, like, “Don’t be afraid, it won’t be easy for a little while, but it’s going to be okay.”
He has also been an anti-tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course on the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
That semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a class on the end of the world, he knew he was launching an irresistible hook there: the end of the “big countdown” of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, to which many people refer as proof of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the following months: catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal chasm that some have dubbed “the debt Armageddon” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where late-time Christian theorists thought the apocalypse would set in.
“I didn’t realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I’ve ever experienced,” Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, it was a very good time.
And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he’s not the only teacher to give classes on “the end of the world” this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real-life examples.
“I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a class, simply titled “The End of the World.”
“We’re adding ‘2012’ to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world doesn’t go away,” Professor Restall said.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and take their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work “until the very night of the supposed end of the world,” Restall said.
The classes proved to be quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," Restall said of his course for high-level students, which consists of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic movies.
“I had never heard of a course that taught this subject,” he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a professor, told us they believed in the December 21 world-ending date.
“Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy, and somehow we discredited it,” said Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old Temple senior from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it’s only a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I do concede that there is an apocalypse-related anxiety in Western culture, dating back centuries, that makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has given rise to these speculations.
“In other parts of the world, people don’t think about that,” he said.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew we were teaching here on “the end of the world.”
“The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world,” he told us, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years there has been talk of the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many have told us that they think they are going to parties "of the end of the world".
“Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
