It looks like a typical rugby club.
At an English university, maybe...
It has nothing to do with the rugby clubs I know in New Zealand.
But that doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that this is common in rugby is pretty much anything...
Yes, we don't interrupt the prayers of Muslims and we don't break anyone's nose during drinking games (well, unless it's part of the game), but we actually painted ourselves in black for some fancy dress parties.
I’ve never played a drinking game based on the Nazi theme that said.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and sentiment expressed in the first-year student flyer seemed quite typical.
That said, this new information leaves no doubt to me that they go much further than the misogynistic jokes and alcohol-fueled jokes that are often associated with college rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows particularly well that they are trying to provoke to the maximum.
You probably don't know anything about rugby clubs.
But come on, why let your prejudices and stereotypes get in the way?
I imagine that the LSE rugby team is populated by former students of these schools for whom competitive rugby is a tradition.
In other words, former private boys.
Coming from very different backgrounds from those who play rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
Are “misogynistic jokes” acceptable?
Looks like my college rugby club, I’ve never seen racist behavior, but bare races across campus, theft, property damage and misogyny were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
Sorry I didn’t mention it in my last comment.
You can see it differently: tell yourself that your own body itself is partly composed of this ancestral water.
I'm going to gain in serenity.
ancestral also so this interstellar cloud (ouf, not traditional:))
You haven't read the article well: a small half of the water in your pastis is more than 4.6 billion years old...
Yes, well we can still consider that the fleet of pastis is on average easily more than 2.3 billion years, which is already not so bad that
A hell of a nose to the catastrophists and warmists of all stripes who predict the end of the oceans and water resources, when this water has always existed.
Irrefutable evidence that warming stopped 20 years ago (see Serge Ferry’s remarkable work funded by Total and Areva).
Manon Troppo: How is this evidence that warming has stopped?
I don't see the link.
Manon Troppo’s comment is ironic.
Uh, and for the second degree and irony, what do you have as a signal?
You don’t understand much about environmental issues.
It is not a question for the "catastrophists" as you say to worry about the disappearance of the oceans but rather about the reduction of the reserves of water consumable by humans (you know the fresh water which represents less than 1% of the total reserves of water on our planet).
And more generally, it is not climate warming that is the most threatening for our species but above all the reduction of resources that are little or not renewable (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our increasingly greedy lifestyles.
As for the study which you cite, and of which you make the generous effort to cite the source, one can naturally doubt the veracity of the conclusion.
Regarding the problems of fresh water, I reassure you the French are far from being concerned xD Then it is necessary to stop considering ecology as a dogma without flaw, the hole of the ozone layer is closing quietly (estimate at 100% for 2050 at the current rate).
Ecology yes, religiously dogmatic and irrational ecology, no thanks.
"Then we must stop considering ecology as a dogma without fail, the hole of the ozone layer is closing quietly" Yes, finally it is not as if it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
I just want to make it clear that global warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our earth will look like Venus.
A greenhouse that by the action of oxygen will capture heat without releasing it and that in a vicious circle will accelerate the greenhouse process exponentially.
Has anyone seen direct actions so far?
Or any sign that 10,000 men would have come to the field to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, no matter what?
Probably not me!
In Abbott’s little brain, perhaps sending the RAAF to the Middle East is its version of direct action.
We are moving backwards, that is for sure.
When are they going to get rid of that village idiot?
The latest revelations that vegetation consumes 16% more CO2 than any allowed climate model prioritize replanting.
This is logical no, since CO2 is the most abundant plant food in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flora worldwide.
It seems that this scientific fact has never been flattened.
Have you seen the Green Army anywhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
CO2 levels rise from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument for plant food is just a fallacious distraction.
And before you throw your glass against the Dooms wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulfur.
Perhaps the most abundant biologically generated material is carbon, but that doesn’t mean it’s the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead’s argument is fallacious and deserves to be ridiculed.
Direct Action is a farce, because nothing new can happen.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now being spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was most beneficial, it is now being invested where it will receive the most publicity to get the Liberals back to marginal electorates.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the prize of ignorance, bravo champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants achieve less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
This means that animals and people need to eat them in much larger amounts to enjoy their nutritional benefits.
That this member is childish is obvious.
So far, he has not presented a certificate of academic rigidity that prevents him from departing from the rules of the 17th century.
However, sanctioning him and not Thévenoud, it is incomprehensible for a lot of people, even if the regulation of the AN is not a tax treaty.
That this lady makes a whole deal of it is not to her credit, it appears above all as hysteria.
If Mitterrand had fined everyone who pronounced Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of names, the "Academy" was offended: "we will say Mrs. the Keeper or the Keeper of the Seals" (a position that until then had never been occupied by a woman).
Pure machismo!
“The political arena.”
The sandbox, the back yard of the Republic repeats, the margot of the operetta guulantes, the table of illusions, etc ...
But the arena assumes gladiators, people who take real risks, willingly, unwillingly.
Qd the phallocrat umpist sits on the etiquette and the parliamentary regulation by breaking the + elementary civility under the false umbrella of good manners, the sanction applies to him "his quality" for his partisan stubbornness and his misuse of the political arena.
This member's behaviour is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's making a provocation to get people to talk about him.
Until now he was unknown, now he can pride himself on being known as is known any canker of a primary class.
The academy has a good back and we see that the deputies are sensitive from the pocket...
The UMP will have to work to solve its internal problems and stop provoking scoundrels and scandals.
The Academy has a good back, especially when it is made to say what it does not say.
This member behaves like a college student in the middle of a teenage crisis, who is provocative and whose friends go, in delegation, to see the Principal to cancel the hours of glue.
and defending it on the basis of a text they haven't even read!
Women do not even represent 15% of the signatories of this forum of UMP deputies.
Mr. Judge, I call on two expert witnesses who are separated by a few thousand years.
That's why I like to spend time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and appealing.
Dogs, dolphins, sea lions, horses, they all do stupid things for the simple pleasure it gives them.
On the other hand, it seems that we spent the majority of our 80 years working, moving and shopping.
What a strange phase we have reached - we are able to double our lifespan, but we spend the majority in boredom.
How did we get here?
Because of the illusion of anthropomorphism.
The game is a meta-communication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
Moreover, "communication" necessarily implies a system of shared symbols.
A difficult concept for you, perhaps?
I imagine that the concept of interspecies communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog that I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variance that indicates if the game will be a race, an object to look for, etc.
It’s not difficult and there’s no anthropomorphism – although I agree with the idea that there’s a lot of bullshit about animals that are “playing” when they’re just communicating.
Maybe the game isn’t just “useful” (it can be, or not), it’s just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber is of the opinion that "there is a principle of play at the basis of all physical reality".
“If he had learned in school that a woman is not an object, he might not have raped her.”
Thank you for the hope of giving you the opportunity to live, to be healthy and to be able today to respond to an article when you had to drink the news without being able to react just 15 years ago.
In general I am not against ideas, and would even tend to be quite enthusiastic about those that seem crazy at first.
But when we see what many have learned from their teaching in school, especially among the public most likely to engage in assaults on women, my enthusiasm does not find the slightest beginning of an anchor.
"the public most likely to engage in assaults on women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's okay, we understood.
And yes, reality doesn’t always smell pink, even if it doesn’t necessarily match your thought patterns.
It is true that the golden youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods do not listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iPhone6.
Evry's defunct youth as well!
If the reacs no longer reacted, Twitter would no longer offer to follow Le Pen and Sarko in first choice.
I didn’t learn anything from it in school and I never raped anyone (and it’s not in my intentions).
Should I consider myself lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me certain values...
The family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How do you start reading life when you can’t read?
And do young socialists go to suburban schools to teach gender equality?
It would be more effective than making moralistic montages on Twitter, but we would have to get out of the beautiful neighborhoods...
Grotesque this campaign.
They suck everywhere, but to teach morale lessons, they’re still the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but yet I want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke about using your bread.
This week’s post is not going to be a bad one.
It's not time to make jokes about bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You made a two-way pun with the word “naan” to refer to a grandmother.
60 pounds for that?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach of a 90-year-old in a nursing home.
How come the more you pay, the less you have on the plate?
Because the quality of the experience is not necessarily measured by weight or calories, just as the quality of a film or piece is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a sparrow?
It doesn't make sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to get you to buy more food.
Of course, it must not be so.
The Sportsman in Seasalter at least is a very, very good restaurant where portions and prices are both reasonably high.
You pay more because you are still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more expensive you pay, the more likely you are to receive an artfully arranged child portion on your plate.
At least they made the effort to put on the tablecloths.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can enjoy good food?
Is the Manif pour tous only a Catholic and Muslim movement?
Yes, that’s it: a kind of gathering of homophobes.
But it's not just that.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern systems of "child-making".
A child must not be raised in a battery farm or manufactured by technological equipment.
Growing a battery?
Where'd you get that from?
And if you dispute any technical intervention in "manufacturing", we must demand the prohibition of PMA for heterosexual couples, it would have the merit of consistency.
I am surprised that the so-called "for all" demonstration does not yet have this logical claim to its attractive catalogue.
It is true that they are not the only Catholics who demonstrate: the other religions too, Jewish, Muslim, Protestant.
That being said, it is still useful to remember that these different churches have ALWAYS been opposed to all changes in society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr. Dupanloup violently rebelled against the will of the gvt to admit girls to school in the name precisely of "the defense of the family".
We are still in the same pattern.
And, more recently, the same currents have been screaming at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school became mixed.
This is the credit that can be given to the positions of these people.
No need to be a catho to be indignant at the commodification of bellies and children...
All this is in line with the decadence of Western civilization, increasingly contested by others!
For me, freedom stops at that of others: yes to the recognition of homosexual couples who have as much right to love themselves as others.
But there is no question of tolerating that the child is a movable object.
And this is also true for straight people looking for GPA.
I just can't seem to like this guy, nor recognize his results.
If he had better control of the ball and knew how to avoid moments of lightning stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
Besides, I am sure that any other striker, apart from Heskey, who plays so many matches for England, will have a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have scored if he had been given more than 42 national team goals.
I can't disagree, at least not categorically:) Since this article talks about the goals he scored, I'm not going to talk about the other things he brings, especially to ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa bring or didn't bring anything), but maybe that would be another reason why he won was much more often selected than, say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 October 07, 2014 12:48 PM Recommende 119 It's fashionable to criticize Rooney right now so we can forgive you for doing it too.
That said, it’s good to take into account that since signing with Manchester City in August 2011, Aguero has scored 56 goals and made 23 assists in 93 games.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and made 32 assists in 96 games.
So a lot of people will have to find another excuse to go after our Wazza because his stats on the pitch are excellent.
By the way, “Wazza” is rather a good reason to ridicule him.
I have to wonder if you really look at football or if you think Peter Crouch A) would deserve as many caps as Rooney and B) would score as many goals if he had had as many caps.
“I really don’t understand where the criticism comes from regarding Rooney’s abilities as a footballer.
The most difficult thing is to be selected regularly in the team of his country for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing Wayne Rooney’s footballing skills (not even an attacker) to Peter Crouch’s?
Are you doing this without joking?
There are really people in the crowd.
Please also note for your guidance that Rooney has not always been England's leading goal machine during his England team career.
Instead, he played the retired forward, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and most recently Daniel Sturridge.
You must have written this jokingly.
In a country where carrying a weapon is tolerated and in a state where 71% of people own a weapon, I find it totally schizophrenic and paradoxical as a way of proceeding.
Well those of this school just don't agree at all with the authorization to carry weapons in the United States!
The use of the pencil is always suicidal.
Stop the bullshit: the girl is 5 years old.
How many kids play with fake guns at this age?
Does that make them potential killers?
Even if the carrying of weapons is in the American constitution and that necessarily influences the culture of the country, I do not believe that the children are significantly different from ours.
A little common sense and reason, please.
It is a disarming process!
Make sure you are surrounded!
The information on this various fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl actually has, or does not have at all, first fruits to the taste of the morbid.
Could we assume that a serial killer can’t already behave strangely at age 5?
If people need psychotherapy, it's more the mabouls of this school than the students!
Let the parents take their kids out of there: she's in danger!
Totally agree.
Those who run this school are obviously completely sick.
Your reaction is the most relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state in the United States, but it is one of them.
What an incomprehensible country!
His relative youth?
These bright blue suits that men wear are nothing like an entrepreneur!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson wear at the beginning of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar wore a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson wore a turtleneck sweater.
I can't comment too much since I've never watched this, but everything seems so boring and soulless.
I don't feel like that's what he meant.
Maybe a contradiction?
But what does it look like?
You got ahead of me.
I would have thought that a meager knowledge of English would be an asset for business.
I wonder what Mr. Bjayou is doing these days.
Perhaps by saying “ostracize,” he meant “alienate.”
That would make sense.
No, I thought that's what he might have meant, but ostracizing still doesn't make sense.
At worst, if all the candidates dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar wore a gray suit, one could argue that their intention was to ostracize her.
But here, no.
Looks like it’s been fixed – weird. Maybe the whole sentence was invented!
It's not weird.
Haha, who knows what he said?
Probably nothing, but someone absolutely wanted to quote something...
So yes, the word used in the article was indeed "ostracize", which meant absolutely nothing.
The unemployment rate in the United States fell again in August, some 6%.
Not seen since 2001.
Gasoline prices are falling in all states.
The American economy, with Obama, is continually strengthening.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Is their economy becoming “sustainable”?
To live there at the moment, I would say that the United States is gradually approaching the explosion as inequalities go crazy.
The political system is literally rotten by the state of campaign finance.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration are on a scale not imagined in Europe, but Americans remain incredibly optimistic about the future of their country and theirs!
How long?
That's the main question
A few days ago the British financial circles said that France was lost.
Now it is America that is at the end of its roll.
Fortunately, there will always be UK to save the world.
Another one of those articles that simply forgets the essentials.
The level of consumption of the US economy is no longer sustainable.
Debts and bank notes could not for long give the change...
Against a backdrop of depletion of land resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And necessarily the weakest and poorest, a very large majority of citizens, will "trinch" or rather snort.
I can't glare at this farrage.
Will Labour finally understand that its cynical and deliberate policy of importing compassionate voters from abroad is causing it to lose even more support at home?
Probably not.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any cost.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their Cold War continues with Russia.
A disgraceful performance by Labour, Ed Milliband is in trouble, it’s played with 617 votes.
As for Clacton 11% for Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that the Blair government’s massive immigration policy was designed “to poke the nose of the right into diversity.”
Labour wins by-election, Tories lose by-election in safe seat against ukip – Labour in crisis Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I guess it's the same multiculturalism that's driving this comeback, the pendulum has gone a long way since the end of the war, and I guess now it's going to go the other way.
Have you talked about your struggle with reality with a therapist?
Lol - Safe seat of Labour, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know it, I know it, anyone who's not in denial knows it.
Sure, the Tories have seen much worse, but for Labour it's a Pyrrhic victory.
Look for the word “Victory” in any context, and you’ll see that when it’s used argumentatively against the word “defeat,” it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a win, but it's skinny.
Labour should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I am indifferent no matter who wins in 2015 as long as the Lib Dems are not there.
You obviously don’t understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes I know the ices of Canada, Greenland and northern Russia are silly on hard.
On the other hand I wonder if the alignment of Venus and Mars etc should not be considered as well?
In general we must see the Earth more "pasty" or malleable than we imagine.
Is that so?
A few small perplexities.
On the other hand Wylie tells us of a "quite simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the crust of the earth, the pressure on the mantle relaxes, which gives / would give a) a boost to the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface???
In any case, either the "whiplash" or the facilitation of access to the surface will be (more or less) localized.
It is difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and vice versa As for global warming, it seems prudent to focus instead on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, Patricedusud, does this volcanism have any effect on our environment?
Does it have an effect on our global warming, future or past?
Is caution not to warm up anymore?
When complexity cannot be solved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe.
Yes, but also, when it's dark, you can see less well.
Hello, the end of the last ice age was also accompanied by greater seismic activity especially in the “active” mountain ranges or on the highly glaciated continental parts of Canada, Scandinavia).
Cordially CB
It is too often unknown that the crust of the earth floats on the magma and that the only passage of the moon causes it to go up or down by some 30 to 60 cm, deferred, following its passage at the zenith, as it does for the waters of the oceans.
This gives that the sliding of the tectonic plates, like the tides, is more or less facilitated by this moving bump, especially since the polar caps are lightened by the melting of the ice, which therefore causes a modification of the balances of the lands at the equator, since the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am having fun with this "human", calling himself the supreme of Nature and its self-proclaimed commanding sponsor, to ridicule himself by his stupid action on the environment that created him and from which he has separated himself so much that has become harmful to himself and to this environment.
And all this to remain the supreme commander of that nature which surpasses him in the organization of his own viscera, by an invention which consists in finding all possible means to dominate his neighbor, one another, mocking collaboration, money.
Earth's crust is not based on magma, but on the earth's mantle, which is made up of solid rock.
Personally, I find it impossible to watch.
Pretentious and arrogant.
It reminds me of Bronowski's Ascent of Man.
Looking forward to the next part.
Beautiful story Wild1
It reminds me of a totally great series from about 2002 called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely, almost no one remembers it now.
It’s a shame that you’ve never gotten past the first impression.
Your loss...
“The Geladas, our distant ancestors” You should look at this passage again.
Or read about evolution.
Great program thanks Brian.
I'm pretty sure that the documentary "History of Humanity" has already been made several times, they still go to Ethiopia (obviously)
Oh there I can't stand this guy, Brian "air miles" Cox, who goes as far as Ethiopia to pretend to make doe eyes in front of a brain in a jar.
And its narration...
It must be hard for you to watch Coxy.
Maybe there’s a support group for you, though.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully filmed.
Does Marcel Gauchet represent a Marxist compass?
Indeed, it is the individualistic identity that prevails today.
It therefore requires to be oneself, in itself, therefore non-compliant.
Certainly, but Descartes is also at the time of the advent of individualism, and his intellectual interrogation expresses this advent.
But at that time it is just the premises that appear, today individualism structures the whole society, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We are in the individualism of "mass"!!
Without making it an unsurpassable horizon, is there not some kinship with the Cartesian approach of examining what one receives to believe, what one believes oneself?
More than rebellion, doubt is fruitful.
To make Foucault a revolutionary is absurd.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatry produced a counter-reform!
By placing the problem at the level of his paranoid navel, he blocked all progress and reflection on the reality of madness.
And brought the most reductive and reactionary vision that supports it: behaviorism.
Gauchet is absolutely right on this point and to be anti-conformist is to fight against this décervelage.
Marcel Gauchet is accused of being a defender of order.
Great idea!
Be beautiful and rebellious, some people ask.
Blacks and rebels, to the others.
Beaufs and robots, include the most followers of those who see themselves rebeaux in their mirror.
Thanks in any case to his polemics protesters to put back in the spotlight of the news Marcel Gauchet, this humanist patient and persevering, and so pedagogically enlightening.
David Cameron Supports Raising the Inheritance Tax Threshold
How many more budget cuts will be needed to pay for the benefits of this wealthy person?
Dave the robot will increase his net worth once he is no longer in power.
Business advice, speaking engagements, consulting fees, a series of bestsellers written by a nigger on “serious politics” – it will be worth $100 once he passes the gun to the left.
Of course, he doesn't want an inheritance tax.
Wouldn't that be the same lie as in the last election?
And the richest are the ones who will most certainly pay the least inheritance taxes thanks to super well-paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a declining Empire where legacy kills innovation.
It will be worth $100 once he passes the gun to the left.
Anything.
It will probably promise to raise the threshold to $1 million, which is well below what you say it’s worth.
What was your position when Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Did you also think that Brown was only thinking about his own heirs, or are you just a brainless tribalist?
We didn't elect him last time, we had a coalition instead.
You could only afford to accuse him of lying if he had actually been elected to power.
Just like the rest of us, "Dave" will not die "normally".
Climate change and the impending collapse will end him and others in his own way.
His “wealth” will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
Non-taxable income is a social benefit, especially in a country where government debt has exceeded 1,000,000,000,000 euros.
We must all be taxed to pay for essential services and repay the debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I am not saying that discipline didactics is useless, of course, I am only saying that it is insufficient to compensate for some natural "inadequacies".
Unreasonable statement for the math teacher she was!
Like what...
Better recruitment and training of teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class knows no other approach than quantitative.
There are 2 possible answers, the first would be to select teachers according to their ability to transmit knowledge.
Plus, she hates children because she doesn’t understand them.
Not understanding them, she does not know how to act or react in order to work well, she is reduced to establishing a relationship of mistrust that makes everyone suffer in pure loss, it would take 1 training in skills to teach.
A job that can be learned.
But pedagogy is above all an art, a natural disposition and a vocation before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not about making auto parts.
Pedagogy is not an equation even when you are a math teacher!
The "sciences of education" cannot compensate for a lack of natural abilities.
What is missing right now is a real vocation for those who embrace the profession.
If gifts exist, pedagogy (I prefer didactic discipline) allows those who are less comfortable not to make mistakes.
There are more effective ways to approach an issue.
The real unknown today are the students of whom 1/3 tell us: learning is useless I already know what I think.
An article by Slate describes quite well the chaotic situation of this re-entry.
Let's regret the old Normal Schools of Teachers..
It ends at 3 a.m. from this week, but it starts at midnight.
If it is, it suits his schedule anyway.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It doesn't suit mine!
It's been years since his show started at midnight.
We have this thing called iplayer that allows us to listen to on-demand shows whenever we want!
The internet is pretty amazing, isn’t it?
I don’t have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at home, I can’t really listen to radio shows either.
I have a USB adapter on the back of my SKY box that is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV seems too complicated.
Yeah, I think I got the schedule wrong, I must have heard Richard Lester at about three o'clock.
Although they are men in the daytime on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in their air schedule when one of the men is on vacation or sick, that at least would please people.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Her show is anything but sensational disguised as a debate, and she would be much better on a channel like LBC.
The lack of female DJs during the day, where none of the regular animators, from Chris Evans in the morning to Simon May's show in the evening on the return from work, is a woman
That's five shows.
Which of these five is more likely to be changed?
Shennan knows this very well, but doesn't say anything - for now.
Steve Wright is the most semi-detached these days.
Jeremy Vine may be sent back to the office as a real reporter, but lunch keeps all the icy air of a Daily Mail radio.
I guess he's quiet, waiting for the current team to get tired of it or get fired.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late?
It is normal for these people to vote for the UN.
For 40 years we have had the same two parties that alternate in power and make the cléfs of the country to each other in worse condition than they have taken.
The countryside is very poor, much poorer than the suburbs with more isolation.
It takes miles to find a cinema, a bar, a gym, a theater.
But since they don't burn cars, don't attack, don't deal, they don't interest politicians...
But please don't talk about a department where you didn't live.
Yes, Doclocal, they are sub-men, sociology is good to look at them.
They have very high rates of absenteeism and early alcoholism as well.
The FN thrives on human stupidity, inculture and ignorance so much to say that it still has a huge potential for growth, it really has to be bad for not having done better...
Today, the FN thrives above all on misery, the fear of everyday life, that of the other and the feeling of having no perspective.
But yes, you are right!
What a pitiful humanity.
Fortunately, there are a handful of people like you, intelligent, educated and erudite to save honor.
They've been looking for him.
Take the voters for a c...
Here's what happens
Who's "they"?
"forgotten" in fact there is less and less resource . . .
Here’s the comment I left on Twitter: Listen – you can’t just “add and mix,” women need to be integrated into the development process.
What I mean by that is that in many developing countries, existing standards are being challenged, such as child care and socio-reproductive roles.
This makes it possible to recognize that women can work in the economic sphere and that's great - it's necessary.
But this is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will then have a double scourge, that is, they will be expected to go to work while continuing to fulfill their socio-reproductive role.
I am not convinced my sister.
The economy and profits do not recognize the roles of the sexes.
Money speaks, and if one sex does not live up to it, the next!
Profits make fun of the life you lead.
What are you doing, what is the benefit and what do you have to offer?
Profits make fun of the heroism and education of children.
If it were a crime, companies would listen.
Employer friends will never employ women between the ages of 20 and 45.
Well said my sister.
It’s very problematic that no one talks about unpaid social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (most of which is performed by women) must be equivalent to more than 50% of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (not to mention the fact that men do not do enough), but it does make it possible to operate our societies and preserve our workforce.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find true “economic empowerment” outside the home.
Thank you for all your comments - to come back to the point of Mskayadee, how can we take into account the responsibilities assumed disproportionately by women when carrying out gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure it will help a lot people who need to check a box.
The tiger is not Russian, it is just Western propaganda.
The Chinese are solely responsible for the current situation and better sit down at the negotiating table.
The tiger has the right to self-determination and Russian soldiers are simply exercising near the border, exercises planned long before the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no anti-aircraft missiles in its possession.
Free Tigristan!
You made my day!
Oh, yeah, here you go.
I immediately came up with the same kind of idea.
This is a perfect pretext to arm a few separatists with a view to annexing China.
If the Siberian tiger is in China, then China is in Siberia.
It is only time to fix this anomaly.
Why does an article about a tiger, a beautiful feline and in real danger of extinction, finally turn into an article directed against Putin?
What's he doing in there?
So this is not a leaflet about the Siberian tiger, but a leaflet about the aftermath of a Putin-com' operation.
When you expose yourself so much to the media, you also expose yourself to irony or even criticism.
The ritornello of perpetual victimization of the Soviet-Putinian sympathizers.
Hollande had also taken the pear with his camel without shouting the anti-French plot.
There our apprentice Alain Bougrain-Dubourg saint protector of Great Russia was personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case the tiger has understood everything, he stands...
That Hollande gets bashered, that's one thing.
At first glance, it seems to be a horribly condescending idea.
But, based on the article, it looks like it’s both an answer to a real problem – emergency dental subsidies – and effective.
It is therefore difficult to find anything to complain about.
And if only 53% of this sample brushed their teeth before, and 73% after, it makes little sense to complain about paternalism.
After all, there is no harm in brushing your teeth!
Indeed - basically, the complaints seem to be related to the fact that they are targeted at the unemployed and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if it turns out to be correct, then it is not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said the department was concerned about the number of emergency dental grants that were being offered by the Department of Social Development’s Labour and Income Department to unemployed young adults.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I guess.
But he seems reasonably well thought out.
There is a disadvantage to brushing your teeth.
If you brush them after drinking wine, it can damage the enamel layer.
If your toothbrush is old and stiff, it can sting the gums and cause inflammation.
And I remember a show on the Guinness Book of Records where someone tried to brush their teeth the longest and the Guinness judges at the time strongly discouraged him from doing so because of the harmful effects of frequent and prolonged tooth brushing.
'at first sight' - very funny.
Sounds like a rotten experimental design to me.
Simply volunteering for this study changed the habits of participants who knew that brushing their teeth would be studied.
That's why most behavioral studies include things like double blind, control groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the program itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to each young person perceiving benefits, there are two things that differentiate this from the test: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they do not give feedback on when they brush or do not brush their teeth (results easily screwed up by people who give their results according to perceived expectations).
Are there consequences at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) have shown that the maternal environment (including the uterus) can have effects on the genetic heritage, not in the genome, but in the expression of genes, and that these inherited traits can be transmitted to the next generation.
Does the uterine transplant affect this phenomenon?
Nesting itself looks like a kind of graft.
There are probably consequences, but as long as you do not want to give birth to an impossible perfect clone of yourself, is it a priori a problem?
It seems to me that it is going beyond the limit of reasonableness.
The desire for motherhood and fatherhood must not push to go further, without asking the question of ethics, risk-taking, for the mother and for her baby.
No medicine is not all-powerful, no it is not limitless and yes it is unfortunate and painful to accept that not all women will have the, or the children they desire to have.
It has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the tran
But let people, women, others, have their bodies, their notion of love that can go to risk-taking and manage your little testicles all by yourself, all alone in your little pants all by yourself.
to "confier" them this magic bag so that they have this wonderful time of pregnancy.
Why would I sterilely keep him in my safe if he can still give love?
The current narrow circumstances make PR FRYDMAN cautious about his communication, but if "one" agreed to think, "one" would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material that is involved.
What will ns lay as anti argument: cf here these reactions all masculine curiously....
Marjane, any organ donation is not trivial.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not totally insignificant.
I had registered as a spinal cord donor (I was never selected because the selection is very rigorous and it is understandable for both the recipient and the donor), this is a real operation.
Now as a man, I would not allow to judge in one way or another or to take part in this gift, but I will listen to women talk about it.
Margane: Indeed, it is nothing trivial, and it reinforces the act of love that it implies.
Giving a kidney to a family member who needs it is not trivial either, and it is done!
Please, no Messi v Ronaldo schemes.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need that.
Especially since there is no competition anymore.
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
Deportivo has become a yoyo club.
They are too good for Segunda but do not have the standard of La Liga.
Rivaldo was not part of the winning team.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for Deportivo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo continues to do everything he can to break all Real Madrid goal records this season so he can then return to Old Trafford this summer with a clear conscience.
I can't believe it.
I believe Ronaldo will end his career at Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you're talking about the stage of the international oil investment company?
I was watching him on a shitty connection so I can’t tell you much about it except that Valencia defended well and besides the possession, they deserved to win.
I was afraid that the midfielder would be overtaken too quickly but they played well.
The game of Parejo overall is getting better.
A terrible penalty cowardly claimed but rightly saved by Diego.
A messy atmosphere Mestalla and it must not have been funny for the Atletico bus to get bombed.
That's interesting.
A complete article, signed by the young researcher Amandine Marshall, “On the origins of mummification”, well illustrated, was published in the magazine Archéologia 524 last September.
It is good to have arguments to confirm and date what we intuitively guess.
No wonder it was so simple before it was complicated.
All science progresses in small steps.
And the "organ" of the woman that was thus preserved was?
Exciting!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me some time ago that a black child mummy had been discovered in present-day Libya and that this discovery had opened up new horizons, especially geographical and temporal (I think I remember that the mummy was 1,000 years earlier than the first known African mummies).
Do you have any information about this?
Thanks in advance.
It interferes a bit with reading.
These may not be contaminations of the modern era.
Didn't the desert then extend less far than it does now?
Why not imagine plants like cannabis growing in the place where there is only sand now?
We know the song.
And it is enough for a European scholar to affirm it, even without any proof, for it to be a scientific truth: the Egyptians and therefore the Africans of yesterday and today have never invented anything even at home.
But the song doesn’t tell us who the inventors of African inventions in Africa are.
If not and always "of his unknown predecessors".
You should read the article.
Here is an article written by neoliberal quacks of the free market and which preaches against the mobility of people and for the mobility of goods.
I think there are other people with Ebola who the Spanish government is lying to us about, not giving themselves a bad image and protecting tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they may remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same thing when it comes to tourism, but right-wing governments in particular (i.e. those in Spain and the UK) tend to protect the interests of business rather than people.
Stop, do not hesitate to call your local MP and complain about the lack of transparency.
Even though I think the government here is just a bunch of useless, corrupt assholes, as Madrid is not a very touristy place, I doubt that is their biggest concern.
What are you waiting for?”
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that allows millions of people in this country to keep their heads above water, I would say yes, it is important.
If they absolutely had to repatriate the missionaries, I don’t see why they couldn’t have sent them to an air military base and treated them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy's mission was to dismantle the Spanish health service, privatizing the nationalized hospitals especially in Madrid, which is his power base, until the courts intervened.
He's just a right-wing public relations bully like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's screwed in the next election.
To be fair to Cameron (I know it’s not easy here) socially he’s far to his right and would fit well with right-wing religious lunatics in America.
Now he must sing the praises of the hospitals he had before descended to try to achieve his goal which is to protect Spanish tourism.
I’m sorry, but you can’t really compare the Tories or any other right-wing European party to the Spanish right.
These are special cases, believe me.
The Spanish government lies about almost everything that concerns it.
It's not like someone could accuse you of spreading unsubstantiated rumors.
So you have some hard evidence to support this idea?
This section of The Guardian is called Comments are Free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting labor at the center of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not get away with it.
Excellent article but above all fascinating reactions on the forum.
Many bosses of TPE - SMEs seem to read Le Monde to take the time to condemn the words of Pr.
Let us turn to the anti-intellectualism of the ambient era.
A law professor at the Collège de France does not seem to be able to know the job market unless he is a Nobel Prize winner in economics and proposes to liberalize it completely.
It was so much better before, it is true when Dr. Villermé saw the work of 8-year-olds 10 hours a day, when the Canuts were shot on sight because of a collective agreement signed.
Ah, the good old days...
Your reaction is just as fascinating because of your lack of knowledge of the profession of TPE boss!
His job is not to know the law in all its twists and turns, but to manage and produce.
Four handwritten amounts written on my salary slip from my youth, more than 100 pieces of information today!
Here is an example, we could cite much more, which illustrates the permanent flow of constraints, imposed without measure of consequences, and which stifle small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a client of the Sorbon.
To twist the neck of the argument about the thickness of the French Labour Code in relation to the Swiss, a serious academic would have immersed himself in the Swiss texts and would have compared the quantity of official texts, then that of the comments (the absence of these can mean that the Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
By comments in a Code, whether it is work or not, we target jurisprudence in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for enforcing the laws when an employee is fired, for example.
Where is it complicated??
Do you think that the rules of law (laws, jurisprudence, conventions, contracts) are unbearable obstacles to work and trade?
What's he doing?
How long does it last?
Pullmann "Art has practically been immunized against criticism.
Is this guy still in vogue?
It is surely time for new revolutionary absurdities to overwhelm critics...
For every article on Ai Weiwei I read recently, you are among the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Move on!
Look elsewhere, there is no shortage of choices in the art world.
If China can produce new artists who are not Communist Party spokesmen, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a troll of the Chinese government.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokesmen for the communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokesmen are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think that Ai Weiwei's art is some kind of fraud, here's what you're missing.
Thanks for that, you just ruined my breakfast.
I'm sorry, but I had to expose it at all costs (without making a bad pun).
He's the guy who pops out irreplaceable old ceramics and calls it art, right?
There is art, and then there is vandalism seeking attention.
Real artists make a difference.
A beautiful artist.
His father is also a good poet.
His father was a well-known poet in China.

KARSENTY DEMISSION this gentleman is unworthy to hold an elective mandate the extremists of all sides (including Zionists) must be sidelined
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous conspiracy theories, which have earned him several judicial convictions, shame both Israel and the town hall of Neuilly.
He does not represent either.
Philippe Karsenty leads his fight against the truth alone, marginal.
WHO IS BROUGHT ASSEMBLY
What does the Neuilly Town Hall plan to do against Philipe Karsenty, who insults a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls to attack this urbanist?
Apology for crime?
Can't find Neuilly on my map?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges???
This type needs care, just like Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the anti-Jewish/anti-Israel conspiracy theory and whose springs are perfectly identical to those of their most furious detractors.
Just as many people think they see in any political decision the hand of the "Zionists" (a term whose meaning tends to disappear, because of its abuse), these two, as well as the LDJ or the CRIF, believe they see in any criticism, even banal, an abject anti-Semitism "which is reminiscent of the darkest hours of our history because it is still fertile the belly of the beast my good lady would come back".
Note that Karsenty’s incredibly stupid theories about Charles Enderlin’s reporting are even more stupid than those about 9/11.
And God knows that 9/11 conspiracy theories are gross nonsense.
And this guy has political responsibilities, which is extremely concerning.
To clarify my analogy with the 9/11 conspiracy theory, we are talking about cognitive dissonance regarding how to approach the subject.
Totally blinded by a totally farfetched truth, having spent too much time, spending too much money to support it, it is unbearable for the adept of this theory to detach himself from it (as in the case of religious extremes).
Following a logical and inescapable flight forward, the end justifies all means, even the lie, which is an attic, but attic does not seem to disturb the mission of the concerned.
You advise to be careful and not put everyone in the same basket, but that’s what you’re doing for 9/11.
There is still a flurry of unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudis/consorts do not seem in a hurry to answer them.
There are indeed some very far-fetched theories, but so is the official theory, at least on a few points.
Nothing is funny anymore...
Health NGOs and public health advocates find that the results of the study are largely supportive of their outreach efforts.
And, of course, they will need even more grants to keep up!!
Just as smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it really is, alcohol will also know its hour of judgment when the actual harm it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to just say things like "excessive alcohol consumption is on the rise," but what takes (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
Sorry if you consider this an attack - go have a drink and relax?
It’s better to risk it than to put my mental health at risk by not taking it.
The government puts an end to pleasure when it costs money.
Here are other alarmist tips based on unreliable statistics.
Two average drinks a day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers but the second implies that it is a more or less safe amount.
Maybe the Cancer Council and the National Council of Health and Medical Research should consult (around one or two drinks, but especially not three) and give us a figure they agree on - whether it is justified or not.
Now we will tax them thoroughly, like smokers!
They are already doing it - soon it will be grass!
My father didn't drink or smoke, and the cancer took him away at 64.
So I’m going to keep drinking my two bottles of red on Fridays and Saturday nights (and the other nights when my wife isn’t around).
Why is the Cancer Council encouraging children to go to places where alcohol is served? This is old news that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What is not related to a cancer risk these days???
Sharks don’t catch cancer – they eat anything but they are not good company.
Sharks can catch cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting’s incompetence has been a recurring topic for many years.
Refuse to run when you could run and vice versa.
Totally agree.
Whiting is Bernie's blessed yes.
The two of them destroyed F1 under the pretext of safety.
Let's hope he does better than Schumi or worse than Wendlinger after his accident in 1994.
Absolutely agree with you, but be careful on point number 1: it is not F1, but the instances of the circuit that refused to advance the start so as not to miss the TV broadcast slots.
Exactly right, +1.
I would just like to wish Jules Bianchi a speedy recovery!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, incidents that almost occurred between troubleshooting cranes and f1 were toll-free warnings.
We knew that one day it would happen, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, had been saying it for years.
How the hell could the race organization and the FIA have allowed these maneuvers without taking out the safety car?
I cannot accept that the risks of the trade or the fault of no luck are invoked when we have not prevented the predictable.
This accident was.
Still, it must be said that there was a yellow flag, which not only means "ban to overtake in the area" but has as its primary purpose to signal a danger.
It's not shameful, it's fortunate for the family that had to be in front of the TV.
Even under the yellow flag, the pilots will just lift their feet.
In changing conditions, the turn can be much more tricky the next lap and the driver, believing he will arrive with enough margin, can be caught even at "reduced" speed compared to a normal pace.
But hey, we talk in the void there, as long as we have not seen the images, we will not be able to issue an opinion posed.
I don’t see much of what that changes.
Are there any injuries?
According to the CBC, no injuries were reported.
The CBC showed the news this morning before it happened, which makes me wonder what caused the derailment.
It’s hard to believe that there are still jobs where you have to be on call 24 hours a day.
I don't think there are any people injured because Canada is almost empty.
There may be injured animals like bears, raccoons, etc.
I hope it's irony.
Some parts of Vancouver have the highest population densities in North America and the Greater Toronto Area has at least six million inhabitants.
In the Saskatchewan countryside, trains do not derail as if by magic and these types of trains often cross populated urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains pass very, very often in a day.
In addition, because the tracks often follow streams in areas where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also pass through densely populated areas, because people still want to live close to the water.
Also, all rail traffic runs through the center of a city since it was a central part of the original construction of the railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is huge potential for rail disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge did a report on this last night, really shocking.
You obviously did not read the article about the derailment and explosion of a train in a Quebec city that killed 47 people?
In fact, you are partly right.
The city of Vancouver was a port city long before the railroad.
That said, when the railways were built, they passed through the centre of the established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Perhaps employees of the Canadian National Railway Company are expected to attend the next Hazardous Products Conference in Calgary, Canada on December 2 and 3, 2014.
CN employees are extensively trained in the transportation of hazardous products.
This article, like many commentaries, ignores the primordial religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers there can be no other truths.
The whole problem is there and the exegesis of theologians only reinforces this fact, otherwise what is the point of discussing the sex of angels?
"God said: that's good - that's bad" > it's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
One leader’s words (Muslim country but not important): “But without religion, how do you hold the people?”
In other words: obey the priest pastor rabbi imam and pray your prayers, it will be better!

May His Noodle Appendix touch you.
Yes, this is what Voltaire and others thought, including Robespierre in a certain way trying to found a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its cults: that of the strong Euro (rather palatable at the moment) or that of the free market (largely supported by the State when it must be bailed out), etc.
Great ideas from religious outbursts.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and secular.
Where the rational emerges, the religious is towed and expressed in the schism.
Religion was born as the ideological support of the state, and the gods put at the service of ambitions even if it also carried forms of contestation.
Theology torn between fidelity to the form of revelation and adaptation to the tunes of time knows no doubt.
Fanaticism is often described as a misinterpretation of “sacred texts.”
This does not resist the examination of these texts which are filled with explicit appesl to the hatred of the disbeliever.
It is rather the moderate religious (and fortunately they are the most numerous) who "read badly" the texts and only retain what belongs to humanism and values common to the whole of humanity, atheists and various believers.
For me, fanaticism is the stupid and mean application of passages from sacred texts taken out of context.
Thus, some verses of the Qur'an calling for killing "infidels", "infidels", "hypocrites", "Jews" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if one does not read a few verses above or below specifying that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in self-defense.
on Yves Petit:" concerning the "foulard", it is indeed a religious prescription that is today almost unanimous among the "scholars".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive point to draw from this is that it caused a general condemnation.
Especially in Australia.
Aren't you guilty of the same harm as the one shown in the clip?
Band of overpaid and hypersexual Neanderthals.
They have outraged humanity enough!
What did they bring us besides insulting us with Les voisins, Pour la vie, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Einstein junior, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, the Bee Gees, Shane Work Warne!
An insult to our intelligence, that's what they gave us!
If you took your eyes off the TV for a moment, you’d see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with cave and stone paintings by its indigenous peoples that are still inspiring modern artists today.
And then there is the Sydney Opera House and a national opera company that has produced wonderful singers such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
Australian cinema has produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
Notable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is New Zealand, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Let me be of another opinion.
Sox does not need any help in this section.
How I guessed it would be a "little white guy"!

The largest foreign journalist based in Moscow.
The most awesome.
His articles are sorely lacking.
He understands Putin and those who support him.
Go see Leviathan in the cinema, you will understand a lot!
Nice effort Savantcosi!
But you may not know yet that Kastals is just a little Moscow telegrapher who has only that to do with his days.
We leave him for a month and when we come back he is cutting out the same salads.
Almost all of the 331 deaths since the ceasefire are civilians from the Donbass who have been bombed by the army, due to uncontrolled elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of responsibilities hypocritically suggested in the article without daring to go so far as to explicitly designate the separatists is in the NATO line of the World which does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the fable of the pro-European neo-Nazis bravely facing the evil Russians.

If I understand you correctly the bad guys are the Ukrainian SS and the nice Russian Stalinists you wouldn’t be a bit communist by chance.
Extract from the (very long) document you quote about MH17: "This post is absolutely not intended to say that the pro-Donetsk resistance fighters are innocent".
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation says that Ukraine is responsible.
Propaganda?
To Alexandre Kastals: where do you get these details about the macabre count?
From the Ukrainian army (it unfortunately loses soldiers almost every day, according to it)?
Uncontrolled elements (likely to say anything)?
ALLEEE ROMANIA!
Alleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
And I say that as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a woman of Hungarian origin, on the other hand.
That said, I can’t stand the Piturca team, they don’t represent me.
Piturca is a member of the ruling powers who has not stopped denigrating Romanian football to the pathetic level he has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the “Coperativa”, which decided before the start of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would go to Europe, which would be relegated, and which would launder money at will, mainly by selling players who were well undervalued.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, was doing business with the aforementioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about a million euros), then paid them, but, apparently he was poorly advised by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have earned him a sentence without serving a sentence), and consequently took himself 3 and a half years in prison.
The trial also resulted in jail time for Becali brothers, four club owners, steua manager Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for football-related offenses.
George Becali is also serving a sentence for trying to bribe (and subsequently conceal the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the last game of the championship, in order to win the title and win the Champions League jackpot.
The team he tried to bribe were our neighbors from Cluj, Universitatea.
We won 1-0 in their stadium, a result that allowed us to be the first champions of Cluj, while they were relegated.
I still enjoy this moment so much.
In the cover-up of this attempted corruption was involved, among others, Piturca, who signed as a witness a false document that insinuated that the money that the police had confiscated from Cluj was related to a land sale.
So this poor uneducated, idiot, cheater and liar guy doesn't represent me, and never will.
Hungarians are just a bunch of nationalist morons these days.
You might think that after the last time they broke stadium chairs and store windows, and they brandished racist banners in the streets they, could not have had tickets this time, but no.
I thought Neil Lennon was about to take over Al-Ittihad.
Wherever he ends up, it will be a disappointment, after Stockport County turned him down.
Great article.
If Sarkozy had done that, we would have heard the left howling like a sick man.
But as it is the nice Holland, friend of the unions and small people, one hears well a little protest, but quite low
This is why economic circles sometimes prefer that a party claiming to be left installs itself in power.
It was the bankers who financed Obama’s victory, and they were not deprived of their investment!
"the absurd idea that the majority of job seekers are not looking for work" LOL (no comment)
Should unemployment control be generalized in early 2015?
I hope that in the process, tax pole, will also generalize the absolute control of the gougnafiers commonly called plutocrats, banksters, kleptocrats, tax evaders, thieves bosses, and other malandrin.
Can you make a sentence without the words banksters or plutocrats?
You seem very proud of your jargon every time.
It's true when you have class: you treat the population of illiterates and without teeth
With each new period of unemployment, I send dozens and dozens of applications to employers who most often do not even boast of an acknowledgement, it was automated.
It is also the complete absence of follow-up or support from the Employment Pole.
To conclude, I would add that the “socialist” name of this government seems to me an insult to the memory of Jaurès or Mendès France.
Have we read an article about the duck here?
We learn that an unemployed person can stay for several months without news of his agency, but that he must continue to look for jobs on his own.
We learn that the controls made it possible to write off people who for more than half were no longer receiving unemployment benefit.
So you wonder how you can control people you never see.
One wonders what sanction represents a write-off for someone who does not have access to employment services or unemployment benefits.
And if we can admit that this reform will make it possible to write off more, we wonder how it will help recruitment.
"We learn that an unemployed person can stay for several months without news of his agency, but that he must continue to look for jobs on his own" Indeed, it is shameful.
We must ask ourselves, why are these countries in the EU when the authorities are clearly incapable of defending the egalitarian ideals of Europe?
It’s not like the Spanish or Italian authorities have done much about racism in football either?
Should we get them out of the EU?
The EU was originally only economic and should remain so.
The goal is not to be a “thought police.”
The EU is a pacifist project.
It makes no economic sense.
This is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is the most unequal society in Europe.
What equality???
Eastern European teams are constantly being fooled by the referees of the corrupt mafia that is UEFA.
The best solution would be for the whole East to leave this rotten, lucrative organization and create its own.
At least we’ll finally be watching football.
This anti-racism crusade is just a screen to cover up injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Currency and trade, rather.
The European ideals of equality?
So what's wrong with Europe letting the UK in?
The Uefa should applaud them for foiling the comedy of Blatter and his men.
It’s been happening everywhere for a few years, and I’m not exaggerating.
From the Guardian two or three days ago:
Could it be that he hoped to be retorted small symmetrical sentences, just to maintain the controversy?
Anyway, it is a fact that at every small event towards peace, there have been, there are and there will be people working to throw oil on the fire.
The decoding would be to say that the Western states are against a "Palestinian state", that they are pro-Israel and that this alone explains that these states have never done anything against the Israeli state.
The decoding would be to say that to solve the Israeli-Palestinian issue, one would have to act against the Israeli state’s over-armed identitarian occupying besieging destructive oppressor colonizer.
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine at the expense of an Arab population that had nothing to do with the Holocaust, it would have been more reasonable to empty Bavaria of its Germanic inhabitants (who were guilty of the Holocaust) and replace them with the surviving Jews.
It would have been justice, the Germans had nothing to ask for and Europe would have kept millions of educated, enterprising and dynamic inhabitants.
Mr., Let's take the example of the colonization of Western Sahara...
That Morocco is the colonialist is obvious!
But, as for Israel, it is also necessary to question history, its allies and its supporters in order to glimpse truths.
Colonialism, whatever it is, has never been altruistic, we agree.
So stop your pirouettes to support Israel as a colonizer.
Gaul was colonized by the Romans but currently there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gauls or others.
In Palestine, there is discrimination on the basis of origin.
Moreover, the Israeli state defines itself as that of a "Jewish people" of which no non-Jewish can be part.
The Israeli state discriminates against non-Jews, hence the dispute.
Conclusion: to resolve the conflict, it is necessary to break with Zionism which opposes Jews and non-Jews.
In the Maghreb, some peoples have even been named after their first status by this saving civilization!
Two realities that need to be ignored.
First, the European Zionist project (colonize-owning Palestine) involved dispossessing the Palestinians, so it was an intrinsically anti-Palestinian project, so the solution requires breaking with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay lacked bite from the start.
Their dull result will give them something to bite their fingers.
He should begin his rehabilitation in small bites.
I hope he hasn’t lost his appetite for the game.
So much nonsense is tolerated, including racial slurs and physically tough tackles in football, but Suarez has been punished too harshly.
I'd like to see him back in England, no matter what the purists say.
Yes, I hate all those molaristors.
Football is a contact sport where tackles exist and yes, therefore, players will get hurt.
Putting your teeth into an opponent’s flesh to gain advantage certainly has no place in the game.
A rugby player has been suspended for 80 games for committing a similar act.
This is the third time Suarez has done this.
If you bite someone at work.
What do you think the consequences would be?
I knew someone was going to bite.
If you are dyslexic, I forgive you.
I am actually slightly dyslexic.
I forgive that two-ball sarcasm.
I bet he was looking forward to coming back to play with all his teeth.
All these puns on Suarez are losing their bite.
I almost bit the hook.
A prerequisite for a good academic path is the respect by the students of their teachers and the school institution.
It works if parents instill that respect in their children.
Parents transmit this respect more easily if they too feel respected by their children's teachers and school.
In good schools those, who advance their students, parents are considered partners, not emm..
Who can believe that it is the teacher who should do all the work (teaching, educating, learning respect, limits, living together short) It is up to parents to do at least 50% of the task.
But it's probably easier to go to school.
Betting on parents is not operational.
No one really took on them.
Therefore, the action will remain limited.
On the other hand, the school could do a lot.
The operational solutions reside there.
Should the actors (profs, hierarchies and ministry) play their role and do not constantly release in touch.
We can dissolve a troop that is out of control to revive it, not the families.
How not to talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses make it possible to give the change.
We pretend to train teachers but we forget the primary role of the school.
Transmit knowledge.
And if there is a requirement of parents, it is that the school ensures the education of their children.
Who is the minister who will dare to put in place what was called Public Instruction?
Disappointing article: little information, partial and unstructured reflections.
You were really waiting for a clever comment from this beauf of the eastern suburbs?
It's a beauf, that's clear, but I think it's more of Willoughby, and therefore of the north coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
No wonder we have a budget emergency.
Drop it and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
Totally true
That's right.
A little Aloysius.
Its electorate is the seat of North Sydney.
Really a beauf of the North Coast!!!
Well, if viewers of the British BBC want to compare the neoconservative governments of our two countries, they would obviously come to the conclusion that both are led by the Tory Wang-Bangers Monster Raving Party.
He's a grumpy guy these days. :(
Yeah, but his leader regularly leaves him hungry.
You would be rather cranky too if you woke up one morning and realized that you will never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these licit and illicit benefits for life will remain forever out of your reach.
Poor Joe.
Really pathetic.
He half tried to come up with a budget and then he gave up.
At least he doesn't threaten to hit anyone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
It will be able to command it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and claim aid from the state.
And since she knows how to lobby, no worries about the result.
And so much the worse for employment in France of which it has nothing to do, it emanates from vegetable farmers always ready to break when their corporation has losses on the markets, external in particular...
It was precisely because their lobbying did not work that the order was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the deadline or an arrangement for marpol, there is no doubt that the project would have been successful.
After, to know if it is good or not and how BF will comply with the law despite everything, it would be nice for "the world" to look at it!
Brittany Ferries is owned by the Breton legumes.
Those who burn the tax and security centers.
They want state aid.
I don't think it's normal for them to have it.
Well to the extent that armed a ship under the French flag is 30% more expensive than any other civilized flag, yes it is normal to wait for a boost from the state.
Or we are condemned to tolerate that the British monopolize the market.
It's your choice.
An eternal French problem that considers its maritime facades as tourist destinations, and not as areas of activity, where sometimes live people different from the average Parisian.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, envy at all.
This is one of the reasons why Britain has to regain its sovereignty.
That's it and then they will create the Breton flag with crews exclusively composed of pure Bretons.
With this, they will definitely reduce costs significantly...
Of course.
Unfortunately, this is what is expected from the BBC now.
They’ve always hated everything about prog, so it’s no surprise that they chose to overlook Hackett’s solo career, which has always been closer to the Genesis spirit of the 70s than the other members of the band.
Hackett was to Genesis what Malcolm Young was to AC/DC.
If you don’t understand how important it was to the sound, you don’t really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel’s solo work either.
I don’t think the BBC can be accused of “hate everything about prog,” since they’ve just aired an hour-and-a-half documentary about one of the biggest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a movie about the Genesis band, not about the solo projects of its members.
As for Hackett’s solo career that would be “closer to the Genesis spirit of the 70s,” I disagree.
Hackett is also not allowed to hit the road, play a bunch of Genesis songs on which he has had varying degrees of involvement and pretend to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour is not allowed to put together a bunch of half-finished demos and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett is asking for nothing more than a fair performance, but he didn't get it.
A curious feeling, Bank’s first solo album, is absolutely awesome, and quite in the Genesis spirit of the 70s.
They skipped Hackett’s solo career because, let’s be honest, she sucks.
Yes, it's one of the best prog bands but would the documentary have been made if they hadn't had their pop commercial success in the '80s?
I still haven’t seen the BBC air a long documentary about bands like King Crimson and Gentle Giant that have an equally interesting story but lack the popular appeal that Genesis has.
Good remarks.
I would still say that the BBC “always” hated the fact that it LOVED progressive music over time.
A person with a personal interest shouts “prejudice”: of course.
A little more from the interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
Absolutely beautiful song.
If the death penalty is an attempt to redouble a horrible act with another horrible act (including sometimes against innocent people), then it is a glaring achievement.
There will always be a big difference between a criminal sentenced to death and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his distorted understanding of society and its rules.
Those who kill him do so from the fairest and wisest vision and reflection of a society.
That is, they have no excuse.
They are indefensible.
Yes, we understood your point of view, the first time already.
That is precisely where the difference lies, Mr LeClos.
It is necessary to have a well-disputed mind among ordinary people in order to enjoy violence.
This is what the criminal has been doing since his distorted understanding of things.
But this is also what pain, hatred, vindictiveness produces in the relatives of the innocent victim: a distorted understanding that will never be available to those who wisely decide the death of others from the sound and just reasoning of their pedestal.
But, to try to balance the analysis, one could still argue that the condemned to death, often, exercised a savage violence, which he could enjoy, against fundamentally friendly people, who made the cost of it free.
The relatives of these unfortunate victims will eventually see their pain alleviated with the disappearance of the one who was the executioner, sometimes the torturer, of the loved one and who haunts their nights.
Let us not despise their relief.
Thank you Émilio for this reflection which I find very fair.
Strong and moving article.
As for Marc Asnin, he shows great intelligence.
That of the heart.
This is probably the most accurate I have read in a long time.
One would, however, seem to read stories from another era, ancient things, that the barbarism of the past would excuse, and then these are the dates that slam, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is that great.
The same goes for the other two “Excellent American Novelists” cited here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all overrated.
I thought you stopped the white one, man.
What's that all about?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is immeasurably better than that painful Bellow, who received him the prize.
Perhaps this year’s Nobel judges have decided that if you’re going to have an American winner, you might as well have a racist [light] one.
Munro is also very good.
They all produce “genius novels” as if it were a literary genre.
His namesake Joseph, on the other hand.
Which ones have you read?
How many books have DeLillo anti-DeLillo read?
I never finished Underworld but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
Is it “Human Moments in World War III”?
White Noise?
The first lighter, crazier, smaller novels, and their dialogues, are also great.
I don't know if I'll ever finish Underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as me and read enough of DeLillo’s books to reject his talent as a writer, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict???
It's just a matter of interest.
It was a line of humor, “the law,” not a demand for definition.
Between the text and the spirit, it seems here so EVIDENT that the lady acted in her sole interest, and absolutely not in that of the institution she represented, that one wonders what the term "conflict" comes to do there.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope it will be very expensive!
Yes, state services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they have not warned him of the danger.
Then we will hear that French employees are not dynamic and are only looking for tranquility.
Flood zones that become constructible overnight when a large construction program will start, it is classic, and not only on a low coast.
Look at the alluvial plains near the rivers.
We have been told that “there are no more floods thanks to the control dams”.
Now, we need to enlarge the upstream retention lakes and cross our fingers.
But it will be because of the state services, of course...
Profit on the ground, on the whole promotion?
On the field.
So 6 million euros.
Is it more clear what the point is?
Take out the calculator and you will dream of the life you could have had by being in the place of Mrs. Babin, 1st deputy UMP of La Faute sur Mer and former president of the Planning Commission, the one that grants building permits!
The 2 breasts of triumphant Sarkozysme are the old and the real estate.
I am from the left and not at all sympathetic with Sarko, but please, no political bass or all-out low blows, we are not in there in a battle of stinking balls.
I wonder if the cops who are involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
U.S. cops are hardened criminals.
The US is a shithole.
So what shithole are you living in?
America is not a shithole.
Yeah, the American cops are tough because of the scum they deal with on a daily basis.
Of course, none of them ever do anything, but the cops “come to piss them off because they’re racist.”
This is a good excuse.
Racism is endemic in the US, it’s unfortunate that it takes an incident like this to force people to see the problem more closely.
Your generalization reveals a profound ignorance of the US...
You don't know it here.
The good cops have to denounce the corrupt racist cops.
SELL THEM!
Do the math.
This kind of open racism does not exist here.
Is this the first time you’ve been in a conversation?
It’s not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant when in fact it’s clearly you who don’t get anything – many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetual problem that is racism in the United States (it’s not idle speculation).
Chances are, you’re underestimating the extent of the problem and not appreciating how much tension is building up about it right now.
And as a result, the line between public service and private security for power and privilege, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances the NYPD in different ways, hence the treatment Occupy undergoes there.
What surprises me is the naivety of some and shocks me the false naivety of VA and others.
And where do you think di'nvestigation journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They will question the officials, make them talk, arouse confidences.
That Lhomme goes to the Elysée is really not surprising.
Then, what counts is the cross-checking, the verification, the analysis.
And here we understand that the sarkolâtres have to worry.
“Munstead, our current president, was elected on a wave of antisarkozysm based on fabricated cases (no place and no conviction) that seem to have been concocted by magistrates (2 referrals in correctional), two journalists friends of Hollande.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, politics, the executive and the press that is not supposed to be an organ of power does not shock you, it is that your partisan spirit blinds you!
RV with Holland...
And of course all this is just coincidence and not guided!!!...
If you think only Sarkozy’s supporters are outraged!
From the excerpt I could read, the VA article only water the sprinkler.
I even laughed at it, it was so rude.
For the rest, the complaint of Le Monde is unlikely to succeed because the journalists are not "forced" to the secrecy of the sources, is it not?
With the difference that there seems to be no collusion between VA and the power while there seems to be collusion between the power and the journalists of Le Monde for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one waiting for an explanation from Le Monde about the substance and its dangerous relationships.
We are facing a state scandal that in any other democracy would cause the government involved to fall.
Hence this op-ed, which says a lot about complicity with the current government.
It is not a question of the left or the right, it is more serious.
I thought the sorrel would go well with the smoked herring!
It's just for the numbers and to cut wages and create housing problems, I'm sure if I were a second-generation immigrant whose life was nice because my parents had come here I would have my doubts about the immigration issue but that's not a reason to oppose the controls.
One of the most sensible people on a BBC immigration show was a second-generation Sikh who said she was comfortable with the number of people coming in and the changes they were bringing with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not cooperating at all, refusing even to give soup ladles simply because of the lady's religion, he also said he didn't have to go into her cult.
“Who said she wasn’t comfortable.”
As we all know, if we let it go, the UK will continue to go to the right - anyone who imposes limits and disputes this should be admired even if he is a pub director:) Good for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were more left-wing, it would be communist.
What do you think New Labour has done that is particularly left-wing?
The liberalization of a country, the NHS this NHS this repeatedly, the massive immigration of immigrants (in their own words to well stuff the nose of the right in), the culture of social benefits, the age of all-is-permitted, the political correctness that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that Labour is centre-left and not communist, I said this as a joke, what I mean is that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the state.
This is typical of the left, if you ask me.
Let go of your prepared arguments as much as you like, but what I asked you is specific examples of leftist politics, or a leftist agenda championed by the New Labour government.
Can you do that?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what he thought New Labour did that was particularly right-wing.
He gave you his opinion, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you asked for.
Yeah - it's more Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the UK’s most powerful advertising director, associates his parents’ situation with that of economic migrants coming to Britain now?
What an insult to their memory!
He was absolutely right to do so.
France to the French!
We fought in 40 45 to fall into another disctature, that of money.
We will make nice savings by firing these technocrats...
I would have to renegotiate the treaties.
Let’s renegotiate and if the word “democracy” still has a meaning in Europe, shouldn’t it?
Curiously, the commission does not look at unfair tax competition between countries vis-à-vis companies.
This must be negligible.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem.
The EU has only one objective: to make the rail transport sector totally marketable.
At term, this means that whole swathes of French territory will no longer be served by rail.
The abandonment of which many territories are already victims will only be reinforced.
To sacrifice everything, including the advance of a country, in the name of the liberal doxa does not seem to me a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will have to be addressed one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to clear the accounts of the SNCF.
The French government has long since resigned.
The regions have the impression of paying for nothing, but not the means to force the SNCF to respect its commitments.
But using public money without waste is essential in these days when public resources are constrained.
And the huge needs.
I don’t know what the competition is!
Does he still have a problem with alcohol?
If so, surely he shouldn't be chief cubs?
It seems to me that you have not really managed to distinguish the problems that existed during the marriage and that you are, of course, still dealing with the pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Obviously, having an alcoholic ex living so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is annoying and very difficult.
That said, it would make sense for me to begin the process of separating your life from the complications you inherited.
Looks like they're doing it, but it sounds hostile to me.
Since you all live so close to each other and the complications seem likely to persist as new ones surface, have you thought about a “plan” of “leakage” so that you can make a cut between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a detrimental effect, but with a compassionate real estate credit company, a good lawyer, and a little bit of pressure from the court, they can be solved.
It looks vindictive and persistent.
Why not go to a Family Advisory Group to say things openly and offer support to help her get back to work and pay child support.
I think that's the key.
Your life is made up of many more things than the time you spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it means meeting the new woman.
Tell them that you will support their choice whatever it is.
Warn them that he won’t necessarily keep his promises about contact and ask them to think about how it would make them feel and how they’ll handle disappointment if he doesn’t keep his dates.
Try for them to keep in touch with their father.
If they see that you are doing this for their own good, despite your own resentment at the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never stop loving you and if you do everything you can to facilitate a continuing father/child relationship, they will know who to thank when they grow up.
I believe that children come to understand who is at fault, if they are allowed to see things for themselves.
Go a little more effort you are close to the Godwin point.
It is bent, in 30 to 40 years civilization will have disappeared, short-term economic interests are too powerful, it is the pot of earth against the pot of iron.
Moreover, with globalization, the country that does the least so-called social, fiscal but also environmental has a competitive advantage immediately, and the others are obliged to follow.
All the politicians are looking for is growth, growth.
We need international coordination, but until then...
It is not climate sceptics who produce CO2.
It is everyone who gets warm, those who use the air conditioning, those who take the plane or the car, those who live in housing that had to be built, those who buy industrial products that had to be produced and transported.
It was not the climate sceptics who protested against the ecotax, but the truckers.
No politics is climatosceptical and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that climate sceptics emit more CO2 than others.
Environmentalists also travel to conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not be enough.
There is also a need for political action (other sources of energy, reducing dependence on cars, etc.).
And politicians act in part according to the sensitivities of their electorate.
"I'll be back" is actually a famous McArtur promise made on March 11, 1942 when he left the Philippines.
Terminator has only taken up the expression.
But it may be funny to say that the expression is Terminator.
"Greenhouse gases are a pollutant" There are 30 definitions of the greenhouse effect, all different.
So we do not know what it is, but any good apostle of the dogma of the CAR seems to know what it is.
Does anyone know what the greenhouse effect is?
Guardian Bingo: How long before someone blames immigration?
I blame the scoundrel who took all the money.
Are we counting Liberians in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I'm asking for my $5.
I blame the liars of the Democrats.
Or the crooks of democrats.
Or the liars of Labour.
We don't care, they're the ones responsible.
Displacement of populations could be a very real aspect of this epidemic.
Asymptomatic or subclinical cases that jump into a car or plane to escape the outbreak only move the infection faster than they can imagine.
Is sex with monkeys better?
You think it's a virus?
I do not advise you to ask for a prescription for antibiotics.
He contracted Ebola in Liberia.
This nurse contracted Ebola in Spain.
Damn, indeed!
Don't use the word immigration, you're going to scare the horses!
The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay for all our pensions, to take care of our old people, to empty their sanitary basins, to bury the 30,000 people who die each year of hypothermia or hunger, (don't forget your wool and cap, which allow you to warm up, turn off the heating AND eat this cheese sandwich).
Don't be so stupid.
Unchecked and untested immigration will bring Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is this a (bad) joke or is it not done on purpose?
It's more comfortable...
This is how public money is wasted to allow a tiny minority of individuals to spend some good time in space making goblets and purring while playing clowns in front of television cameras.
So reality TV didn’t invent anything and the authorities are surely waiting for a baby to be conceived up there to ignite the world and delight the media coverage of Western royalty accustomed to tabloid maternity.
Maybe they should come back down to earth and see that we're working here!
Contrary to what you seem to believe, we do not send men or women into space to make gallipettes or clowns, but to work.
And this work is very useful for humanity in general.
And this, in all areas.
Many of the things that improve our daily lives come from space research.
So yes, it’s money spent.
You can cite one thing that improves our daily lives and results from space research.
It's just a money pit.
the ballpoint pen that works the tip in the air (to write on the ceiling for example)
To pay his bills?
To participate in the manufacture of yet another useless product?
Or how to make more money for investors?
In short, working to work means nothing and represents emptiness itself.
Oh, and the latest high-tech game.
Behind the tiny minority of people who go into space, there are several tens of thousands more who are working to make this possible.
You know, people who work what, including more and more private companies, especially to get the cargo to the station.
If you are thinking about buying a plastic gun...
But, what about those who don’t think they’re buying a plastic gun now but who have the potential to buy one in the future?
They are perhaps the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to trick people into believing that it is a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article, it would have hurt him to put a photo of the "sword" in question instead of generic photos of "plastic swords"?
Or even be curious enough to wonder what the inscription (if any) on it meant?
A typical bad report, we dwell on the fact that “it is only a plastic sword” and not on the inspiring jihadi text that is written on it.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Shia Islam.
Dirani’s family, on the other hand, is a Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, and the terrorist groups that seek to bring down the governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people would stop laughing at the fact that plastic knives are harmless.
In skillful hands, they can be deadly.
Even the small cutlery that is given in fast food restaurants can pierce the flesh.
Thank you very much for this info, so if it is a common decorative object, it justifies the ridicule that the author gives it.
No need to try to make it a “ha, ha, plastic sword,” the facts as you said them actually support his argument.
I have occasionally seen these decorative objects in Muslim homes, or painted on the walls, they never looked threatening, just another version of a "cross".
Jesus, you are right.
And it makes sense now...
I saw this guy who looked like he was from the Middle East at Kebab Stop and was handing out plastic knives to anyone all night!
I like the conclusion very much.
All the wonderful novelties, often technological, suggest to many people that it is a right and a need to benefit from it, but they have an immediate cost and worse, a spread cost (subscription, electricity consumption) that weigh in the budgets.
And the inability to take advantage of new technologies creates frustration.
For example, call on the Solidarity Energy Pact, which makes it possible to isolate the attic of a house for a symbolic fee when it is inhabited by a modest household (the costs of the work are borne by the energy suppliers in fact!).
Simple effective but unknown even if more than 3000 houses were isolated this year!
Interesting about this pes.
But never heard of it.
Who can appeal and how does it work?
for information 60 million consumers, tests water-saving showers and recommends the installation of water-saving equipment on faucets and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 can reduce its water bill by 30% (from 150 m3 / year to 100 m3) or 50 m3 of water savings per year, while keeping the same comfort.
It is not a demand crisis, it is a crisis of the system that can no longer produce enough surplus (which it would then have redistributed in the form of an increase in income in real terms) for these surpluses to pay for the increase in expenses that you classify in the category "constrained expenses".
In other words, energy poverty is “just” the other side of the coin because the economy can no longer grow as fast as it would like.
Note that the (neo-)classical theory of economics is totally incapable of answering such a question, because for it, there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no element likely to constrain, increasingly strongly decade after decade, the pace of economic growth.
By its very definition (in physics), energy is what makes any physical transformation possible.
Since production is fundamentally transformation, energy is what makes it possible to achieve the least economic production (good or service).
And the more you want to produce, the more energy you need.
This means that any upward constraint on obtaining energy (improperly called “energy production”), even in the form of an increase in its price, in turn forces production to increase (except to improve energy efficiency, but improving energy efficiency still requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive enough).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy poverty and the fact that we manage, or not, to increase the "production" of cheap energy.
And the data published very officially, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation will only get worse in the coming years and decades (the IEA, in these latest reports, clearly indicates that in 2008 the peak of conventional oil production, understand, cheap oil.
Oil is the most universal form of energy, because of its very high energy density, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good work regardless of the performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and we didn’t bring anything back so it equalizes things.
Take that from France!

Are you a Guardian webmaster?
As we have seen before, it is good to win.
It's good to win.
Really good work, guys.
Although many Englishmen like to make fun of the Scots when they are just losing, there is no need to say, they bring some color to the tournaments when they get to qualify, at least until they get eliminated in the first round.
It's even more fun if you play against them ;)
England is starting to worry me.
Because, now that the “Golden Shige Generation” is retiring, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen return to the starting XI, why change a winning team?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been “world class” is David Beckham, a bit effeminate, maybe, but I think if he tacked an overweight potato like me, he would crush me completely.
People forget his athletic constitution, by the way, when talking about athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I never make fun of the Scots.
I tend to surprise myself by observing their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, was truly “international class” is David Beckham.
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, in his best hours, a very, very good player.
Of course, Juppe would have a hard time asking for 100,000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
Not sure if he would get them if he asked.
You mean people come here to have a good laugh?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, only lives on his indemnities of deputies...
I especially wonder what he can say in his lectures.
How to reduce your deficit?
How do I get back to full employment?
I would say that no serious lecturer of a scientific discipline, whatever his scientific level even if he holds a Nobel Prize, will think of asking for the least amount.
Conferences with content are mostly free or almost free.
And I can assure you that these young people are actually working and that the results presented in their lectures – free of charge – are real.
At the time of the restrictions on the research budget the comparison of these two figures is edifying.
The researchers’ conferences are even paid by the lab!!!
That's to say...
Everything lights up for me.
They look at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the ethics of the UMP
I feel like he’s being accused of making money???
I’m far from being one of his fans but, be it blamed for having hurt (or fraudulently) running his OK campaign.
But speaking at conferences seems to me to be quite a legitimate activity.
To add to Nina’s comment, let’s remember that her travel is supported by taxpayers.
Rule number one of epidemiology: Isolate yourself.
All U.S. and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than political correctness.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential locations.
At what density of infection will politicians resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the UK, I fly to Spain, and then I take a plane from Spain to the UK.
If Ebola gets worse in West Africa, I see them banning all flights and boats to the UK.
We would always need to send goods that said...
What a pity that the international media panic about Ebola is no longer used to talk about the less spectacular but more deadly health crises affecting the people of West Africa.
We are all threatened.
In every corner of the world, men, women. It's such a sad journalistic article, such a weak headline.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other (just as relevant) contexts: Women are the first care givers - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc., etc.
So much smarter comments could have been made about the ways, reasons and places where we can all contribute to better understand and interpret cultural and sociological approaches, and the differences in gender roles that could help combat Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's think and write, let's not just make noise.
There is a moment for everything.
If you’re not able to offer good analysis and intelligent opinion, maybe you should just think before writing?
Although I would equate female genital mutilation with beheading – an equally barbaric form of terrorism, its survival rate making it just another form of torture – to say that its temporary suspension is a “glimmer of hope” is beyond belief.
By the way - I see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of "validity" in his opinion, but in this case obviously it does not give a better perspective than that of an average activist on the street.
And I who believed that the Guardian was “ripening” as a global resource for journalism – moving into the 21st century, abandoning its founding precepts.
Who, in the editorial team, makes this look like it?
For a territorial or other elected official, money does not count.
I am constantly reading that the territorial public service is increasing its workforce, and I have never seen an article giving them the floor or trying to explain why.
That would be legitimate, indeed.
There will be lies and truths, it is up to us to separate the wheat from the tares.
The court of accounts is expensive to tell so much economic nonsense.
It is true that they never had anything to do with the people of Cambon Street.
TRQs are not in deficit, they have financing needs that can only concern and only the investments they make.
By dint of using concepts too fuzzy the press as the World makes the game of all obscurantisms.
Debt is beneficial since it finances investment, collective wealth
Unfortunately, debt mainly finances operating costs...
And since the over-recruitment of civil servants (to make beautiful roundabouts for example) leads to an increasing and incompressible load (compulsory load until their death, since lifetime work + retirement), these communities are cutting into investments.
It is therefore necessary to abolish the status of civil servant, prior to the reduction of the allocations.
And also empower mayors financially.
It is fabulous, the intercommunes should have been accompanied by a decrease in the number of communes and it is the opposite that occurs, proof that adding one step is not effective without removing the others.
How do you want to properly manage territories as big as peanuts at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse where these territories were created is over, it might be time to react.
No, they would prefer to remain imprisoned, worse stuck, in the administrative web, it would seem!
Let's even try garrotés, It's not too strong to explain the blocking situation to which the state of the V has led with its providential men.
It really started with Peyton.
Then went on to finish the series "out of breath" arriving very timely.
Why aren’t they going to live in a $250 million apartment in Monaco over a movie theater to leave all that suffering behind?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the "it's the whites' fault" kind of answer.
“Answers” not “Answers”
I really hope this is sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn’t obvious enough.
This is what happens when you hurry to be the first.
Whether it is sarcasm or not, there is an argument to be made.
It is now agreed that modern Homo sapiens evolved in northeastern Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and during a particularly wet period about 150 thousand years ago they managed to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least the last eight thousand years) is part of history.
The current defense minister said a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So he lied.
He was probably the only one in the government who seemed to be on the road.
Now we know we can no longer trust him.
Resign!
in 2017: Transformation into a comfortable private mansion of golden closets for future retirees of the Republic?
Moving the floor dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for the affluent and their families, the "Grand V" care of a 3-speed medicine.
We're going to save money and the military is going to treat the little boy's flu somewhere else...
Did you know that 70% of patients are civilians, from all walks of life?
The London Wasps?
I feel sorry for their fans who are based in Wycombe/London.
Like the London Irish and the London Welsh?
They dropped out of “London” last season.
It's just the "wasps" now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
It changes that a football team uses the field of a rugby club instead of the other way around.
In addition, traveling outside for the Tigers and Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't make any difference.
In Stockport County, we had the misfortune of being bought by the Sale Sharks, and we ended up renting our own stadium from them once we regained our independence.
I was going to say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training on the ground, although they had access to other premises, did us no favours.
I love to support Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There is always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has a lot of fans and that until recently was at the top for more than 30 years, to see its stadium taken over by a rugby club.
I am aware of the recent problems of the CCFC but this must be a good slap.
For my part, I’m not club rugby, and to be honest I don’t know anyone who doesn’t except a few Wasps fans at work.
They and a few thousand other people in the Southeast will surely follow them from afar or they will now have to support another team?
Nice article pro-domo and good popularization.
But who cares?
But then, why aren’t ALL computer systems based on these concepts???
+because a gigantic mass of programs pre-exists (cobol, java), +because not all systems require them, +because there is no magic wand ++....
And because for most computer systems, bugs don’t really matter, what matters is being the first in the segment.
The work of G.
Berry is about a niche need.
Mr. Gerard Berry.
One should constantly (the media) such characters, who work for the good of humanity.
For children.
I know some.
Professor (retired) Mr. Noêl Dejean de la Bâtie.
The former director of law and political science in Rennes Mr. François Chauvin.
Professor Hugues Chabriat and his team of researchers.
Mademoiselle Isabelle Le Ber Chercheuse and her entire team has L’INSERM.
Mr. Jacques Le BER, brilliant computer scientist.
Madame Maîti Girtanner Concertist (Piano) Professor of Philosophy, Medal of the Resistance, Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor.
Mrs. Hermine Venot Focke.
But they don’t sell.
Real-time computing has become a key industry in many areas, and few are those who know the intimate details of these processes.
I haven't been to an olive garden for 15 years.
The price-performance ratio has decreased.
I'm sorry for those who are going to lose their jobs but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices whose popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There is already too much salt in our diets.
Do not ask Olive Garden not to put salt in the future.
Looks like they're reasoning with Let's make more profits, and not Let's make healthier dishes at the best value for money.
They think we're pigeons.
Be careful that people don’t get too much.
And then let's have our soup made by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there is plenty of salt in it, it replaces the real ingredients.
It would be good to add some sodium glutamate as well.
The amount of salt you need to add to the pasta water is negligible, but it greatly enhances the taste of the finished product.
It’s not just the taste of salt, it also affects the way pasta cooks.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there is no food.
Everyone should try alternatives to corporate cooking.
Are there family restaurants and do they offer tasty dishes at reasonable prices?
What is happening in the United States is very sad.
An ordinary work accident that went wrong.
A promising young man, an apprentice thief, was following his father's career in prison for murder.
A man screwed up and abruptly interrupted this birth vocation.
That he is sentenced to 10 years in prison seems to be the minimum.
Where else are we going?
Totally agree!
What a humor!
The desire to fight it is obvious and difficult to excuse and blame at the same time...
Indeed, the desire to fight against it is hardly excusable.
That's why I have some sympathy for a 15-year-old kid.
During the trial, the boy's father complained that he would never see his son again, but did not apologize to the relatives of the guy he killed himself.
Who is really a victim in this story?
What do you come to mix everything!!!?
The boy's father was convicted for what he did.
Regarding the bullshit of the stray bullets, the accused and guilty, knew very well that the bullets are dangerous.
The boy did nothing to the defendant.
Let him pay for the crime for which he is responsible!
Ten years is a lot in my opinion.
For having the intelligence to shoot at this young man to make noise?
Indeed, it made a noise!
If the opportunity arises, go on holiday in the Mosulle valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small winegrowers.
I’ve done it twice, the wine, the scenery and the food are excellent.
In addition, if you are there during one of the many wine festivals that are held in each municipality, it is even better.
Sorry, Moselle Valley, I hit too fast.
It’s good to see that German wine is well known.
Importantly, German winemakers traditionally only use one variety of grapes, which means that they really have to work hard to maintain a certain quality.
Of course, some younger generations are experimenting with different grapes, such as in France, Italy, etc.
It is not only the Moselle region that should be recommended - Franconia, the Rhine Palatinate (Pfalz), Baden are worth visiting.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is like a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are German style (or maybe the opposite, in short).
Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink wine after a meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during the meal, they now offer many, and with a much higher alcohol content than their favorite 9 degrees.
But their traditional wines bottled at the property are so complex, the sweetness is superbly balanced.
Try Schloss Vollrad’s spatlese with a thermidor lobster the next time you go to the restaurant.
Search Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
Hugh Johnston’s World Atlas of Wine is a good, beautifully illustrated guide.
I understand that there will be new readers of the Guardian who discover wine, but this is a recap of every newspaper article on German wine since the dawn of time.
From time to time, there is an article about the German wines that are coming, the new Baden dry wines that will now accompany the dishes, the red wines that are surprisingly vigorous, but above all, it is not these disgusting Liebfraumilch that people drank when they were young (huh, I really do not think that it is always true or evocative, unless I already address myself to the over 40s).
Closing the Val de Grâce would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the lamentable state in which is the Administration of France.
A crime against Louis XIV and a thorn in the foot of my great-grandfather and great-granduncle who studied there.
In a democracy, the management of public health should be put to the vote of the Chamber of Deputies: these bickering of ministries that are held by the barbichette, and these decisions taken behind closed doors, have become unbearable.
Sorbogroin is right.
We should do as in Soleil Vert: euthanasia at 70 years old.
Moreover, we could sell the meat that will feed our poor working poor (sic) since they can no longer go to the market.
In reality, find work for our unemployed, real work, and you will no longer have deficit problems!
For the elderly, it is time to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
Assets, endangered, will not be able to hold this demographic transition alone...
So geriatrics, certainly, but to think differently than a hospital model of the glorious 30s.
From now on, the maximum growth at 1.5% (it has already been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the whole model defined after the war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in medical matters in France: a certain rigor and discipline that we know best in public hospitals.
If that symbol falls, we're really screwed.
First of all, we screwed up because the rest of the hospitals are not up to par.
The scandal is that presidents and other elites are being treated elsewhere than in the public hospital.
The solution is more in increasing the supply of public service in other hospitals than keeping a two-speed medicine.
The Val is a pole of French medical excellence, and of course a symbol.
Closing it would be a mistake, a further sign of the march towards the mediocrity of France.
Not to mention the military status, which must be kept absolutely.
"The price of day of hospitalization", unit of management of a hospital, is decided by the ministry with local supervision of the Regional Hospitalization Agencies.
The abomination of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, obviously the baby is just one of those economic refugees, he came to Australia to have a better paid job than he had at home.
In almost every country in the world, a child born in that country to two non-citizen parents is almost always non-citizen.
Australia goes further than most countries by making children born to Australian residents citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticized because it does not meet some remarkably high standards, with obvious difficult consequences.
Why???
That seems to me to be double standards.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to end all the persecution and abuse and war that is driving people out of their country and forcing them to seek help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people to come by boat, then we have to solve the problem that generates this traffic.
I have nothing to complain about in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
This is what happens during civil wars.
However, the war ended 6 years ago and the country is back to normal.
Everything makes sense now, nimrod...!
Strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron did not believe this little trick when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron denounced the war crimes and abuse that were still taking place.
Several European countries have since suspended deportations of Tamils with links to the LTTE, believing they would face a risk of torture upon their return.
UNHCR revised its asylum assessment guidelines in December 2012 and recommended that persons with links to the LTTE be considered at risk upon return.
The year [2013] saw a rise in attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
Elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
Too late, boys!
Seor Nowak, se le ha ido el coco con tanto periodico.
In fact, this guy couldn't get even a chance to make it.
He didn't have an insurance in the States?
So he wouldn't have been given any treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expenses during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes later.
Specially in Texas
Ah ah ah!!!!!!!!!!!!
Until recently, we were told that Ebola kills so quickly that a large-scale epidemic was impossible (there is a whole scientific literature on the issue, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of contagion of the people brought back was zero.
The more we are reassured, the more afraid I am.
You have to read funny newspapers to believe that a risk can be zero.
Low or very low but not zero.
Finally, it is a scientific reality, the more a virus is deadly quickly (generally) the less likely it is to spread because the death of the host signs its own death.
The combination of the 2 (high transmission and rapid death) sometimes happens ex the so-called Spanish flu.
After c is the general quarantine to save humanity. ..
There is no obscenity in putting forward Westerners, certainly brave and virtuous, but at the expense of thousands of other African patients whose profession, bravery, or virtues are not known?
Of course, this highlights the work of NGOs and encourages them to help, but the repetition of the announcements is terrifyingly biased.
Freedom of speech, so loved by conservatives.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers in arms attacking the freedom of expression and the right to privacy of Australians.
I bet they never imagined that their conservative leanings would have robbed them of their rights to free speech.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott.
I bet there's one that won't do it next time.
Yes, this is exactly what is needed right now, with fewer health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A warm up round for when the problem actually gets out of control.
There are already not enough doctors working in the regions around Australia like this.
Tony Abbott’s refusal to take part in the “war” on Ebola illustrates his philosophy about medical challenges.
Joe Hockey’s plan for a new Medical Research Futures Fund, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, is likely to be just an emergency slush fund for the budget.
Using the pretext of noble medical research, it will raise $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope Australian voters can see this excellent ruse for what it is.
Tony Abbott is smarter than you think.
He explains that the sale of Medibank Private is offset by the Futures Market Fund for Medical Research.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly and a loss for low-income people.
It may be very smart, but it's not fair.
Finally, the "liar rodent" and his Telstra Futures Fund were excellent tutors.
If that's not fair, then let's show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell at the next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine is still the "old personality", tasty....
I noticed it too, quite corrosive as a remark.
If only it could dissuade her from maintaining a buzz about her constantly..
The worst fate for an end-of-career politician: not being recognized on the street.
She was not recognized in her city of Toul as being sufficiently up to the task of administering it.
How good is “provincial” common sense!
We are living in an odious time, Mrs. Morano.
Of course I'm against wearing the burqa, but that's not the point.
What this anecdote tells is pure Sarkozism: tiny mediocre ministers, a confusion between the function of government and the function of execution (if he could Sarkozy would come with his tonfa on each accient of the road to show that he is indeed the guardian of public order), the rudeness and overtness carried to their maximum degree.
I propose that Morano, Sarkozy and all those “former personalities” who have become unemployed be granted the right to carry a firearm and a badge, so they would have every opportunity to exercise their self-proclaimed function of vigilantes.
Who is Nadine Romano?
This is indeed the main lesson of the case: even the police have turned Sarkozy’s page, perhaps they don’t even regret it.
He really has to stop before it gets in his way.
I envy this agent who didn't know about Nadine Morano's existence, if only I could do the same...
Same as Bob, for now.
No problem, thanks to her, we laugh.
Nadine, if it didn't exist, we'd have to invent it!
It's easy though, she looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde wig.
In this case, N.
Morano evidently did so in contempt indeed, in contempt of the police officer she had in front of her, and who should probably have multiplied the bows and the “Yes Madame, of course Madame, at once Madame, tell me Madame in which direction I must run to seize without waiting for this veiled woman”.
“In one case, the Australian Super Hornets dropped an airstrike on an Isis target when the risk of killing civilians became too great.”
The Americans are not bad at this, but I still think Isis will overtake them or have already done so, in Iraq at least someone counted the corpses now here nobody does.
As for civilian deaths on an industrial scale, nothing rivals the Western war machine.
I do not agree that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (which includes non-Westerners) between the two Iraq wars would have claimed the lives of millions of Iraqis, especially children, the elderly and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war protesters I knew preferred sanctions to the surge of the “war machine.”
Were you also the kind of guy who preferred penalties to prescription and men on the field?
Very good point - the UN has acted incredibly hard and recklessly in recent years.
Sanctions are generally ineffective and fail to reach the elite – no doubt a reason why they have the occasional approval of the so-called Security Council.
You may recall that the insurgents wasted no time in marking their main enemy when they saw it, in the recent war in Iraq.
This was the attack on the headquarters of the United Nations Mission that they had erected just five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place forcefully and twice and I imagine with satisfaction and composure.
As brutal and harsh as this bombing was, I was surprised by the shock of people knowing that a UN mission was targeted like this.
Good point, I had actually forgotten about it.
So add half a million people to the total death toll of Western nations (at least with the recent unrest in Ukraine economic activity was directed directly to the people they intended to hurt).
It does not help your argument to exaggerate notoriously unreliable statistics.
The only figures even vaguely reliable on the deaths related to the sanctions are those of children under 5 years old and they are even very suspect since Saddam Hussain refused to let objective inspectors see the facts.
It was obviously in his interest to exaggerate the negative effects of the sanctions.
The most reliable estimate is that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows.
As for the additional deaths in the other age groups, the estimates are no better than the assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanctioned deaths among those under five was about 10 times worse than in the UK, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanctioned deaths is largely biased towards this age group.
Of course we must fear it, but also the gift of gametes in general.
We must stop pretending that people are pure spirits, that love is all that children need, and that we can do them with strangers that neither the parent nor the child may ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipus, 60% of French people do genealogy.
It is an essential and despised thing to know its origins.
Instead of acting as if it were obvious and using whimsical arguments, we should be told what serious problems can arise for a child adopted or conceived with gamete donation.
If you found out that the parents who raised you didn't provide the gametes you came from, you could get over it, in my opinion, because they wouldn't have committed any crime.
The latest advances in PMA (uterus transplant, for example) are at least as questionable as a reasonably supervised surrogacy.
The real question seems to me to be: does the frustration of the desire for children justify these acrobatics and it has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Very fair as a point.
It is obvious that we must fear surrogacy, what is this stupid question
Of course, it's sad that you can't have children when you want to.
That's a problem I've had with my wife.
But all the same, it is less serious than being born very handicapped or becoming so, contracting a serious illness, losing all his children in an accident etc.
Of all the worries in life, this is not the most serious.
This is one frustration among many.
This does not prevent us from living.
You can always take care of other people’s children.
In a society that no longer tolerates any form of frustration, where the child becomes well consumed, surrogacy is unacceptable to me.
The desire of a child is not a whim where one could use the other according to one's own will.
Sterility requires reflection and acceptance.
