Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
In Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services need to prepare for a spike in COVID-19 patients in need of care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a novel coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been dubbed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild condition, i.e. a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, most of which is curing.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 results in a more severe condition requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a severe form of the disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we assess the evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), and compare it with the evolution in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 has continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and that date, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Obtaining the Cumulative Number and Cumulative Incidence of COVID-19 Cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of cases of COVID-19 reported in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as ministries of health, national and regional health authorities of different countries as well as WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to make a comparison with the experience of Italy.
In order to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 active cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases at 14 days, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of reported cases in each country as of March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m. with data from Italy for the period January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The evolution of the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February before experiencing a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of 8 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and there are differences in the responses of national public health services, potential variations in case definitions as well as differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation purposes, including for catch-up testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or intensive care wards are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not presented).
There is, however, a need for systematic collection to complement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a significant gap in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive and intermediate care beds per 100,000 individuals in 2010-11).
Modeling scenarios for saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of inpatient COVID-19 cases associated with a risk of 90% exceeding capacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment for COVID-19.
Given that cases were previously clustered in some regions of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and that hospitals and ICUs generally have a defined regional population, case data and ICU beds should preferably be established at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS 2).
The experience of Italy and the current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 as well as an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring care, and in particular intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, moving from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not allow sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, had nothing been implemented upstream.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also identifies public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window through which each country can strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Otherwise, it is likely that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a spike in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The coronavirus disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian catastrophe.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which led to thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but is far more transmissive, and affects older adults more than younger people and men more than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on this emerging disease, this article strives to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this burgeoning research topic.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions are still waiting for answers, we hope that this review will help to better understand and eradicate this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, January 25, 2020, forever marked the Chinese, who were forced to remain cloistered for the duration of the golden week as well as for long weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; this is why it was dubbed SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan and quickly spread to all of China before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is “public enemy number one,” potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 studies have been published on COVID-19, particularly in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020 presenting the virus sequence, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this new and growing topic.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that occurred in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of prevention and prognosis of the disease, and address some outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, causing about 15% of common colds.
However, during this century, we have experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in recent history.
As shown in Fig. 1.1, outbreaks of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was revealed.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic had spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with all its public transport interrupted.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered the starting point for infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO called the epidemic a global health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had already spread to all of China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig.2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final scope and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the outbreak as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65 age group.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/100,000) more than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was developing in outbreaks, mainly in Hubei province and the periphery.
The average time between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time between symptom onset and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The baseline reproductive rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, which coincides with the massive displacements that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and adjusted mortality for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (-60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large, enveloped viruses containing single-stranded RNA.
They can be classified into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, coronaviruses known to infect humans belonging to the alpha and beta genera.
Spike glycoprotein (S) of the envelope binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cellular receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins forms virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity between 10 sequenced samples taken from the outbreak’s original site, the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium of the respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a lesser infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by goldf3b as well as a secreted protein encoded by goldf8.
SARS-CoV-2 gold3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFN; however, gold8 does not contain known domains or functional patterns.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the cryo-ME structure of the complete human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 ? in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for coronavirus recognition and infection.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were found to have originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via civets and camelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats have been advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-like coronaviruses from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission is yet to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., hypothesized that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which would involve homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study by researchers in Guangzhou, China, pangolin - a long-nose mammal that feeds on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if judged by the 99% genetic homology between a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% gap between two genomes is a significant difference, so conclusive results should be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig.33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and humidity of 40 to 50%.
The SARS-CoV-2 could very well have similar properties.
It appears that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
To date, no detailed studies have been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the host’s innate immune system through molecular pattern recognition receptors (MRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
In different ways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T cells, including the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
The helper T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines in order to support the defense cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humor immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion in the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious damage to the lungs as well as other organs and, in the worst case scenario, multivisceral failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by outbreaks, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are at greater risk of infection than others.
It is estimated that the average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, but more generally 3 to 7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective duration of the quarantine to the most precise incubation period possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
For severe cases, patients quickly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest X-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus to allow for early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients required ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported from two recent studies conducted on a family and a focus that emerged following transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with a higher lethality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also seen in patients with MERS.
For SARS, the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%), and sore throat (13%-25%), and about 14-20% of patients required ventilatory assistance.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2% for 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
In comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The data above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
As a result, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak than it has been for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or within a gathering or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often traveled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or have been in contact with infected individuals or patients within two weeks of the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that restored patients can carry the virus again, highlighting the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts and lymphocyte counts, as well as high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia, were identified in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are found in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by uneven bilateral shadows or frosted glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In the case of ARDS, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise the gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes leads to a decrease in surfactant levels and an increase in surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to inflate and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most worrisome chest exams often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed desquamation of pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membranes, interstitial lymphocytic infiltration and the presence of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and is similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the primary endpoint for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which then no longer relied solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technique based on CRISPR technology for the purpose of detecting SARS-CoV-2, which makes it possible to identify synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA between 20 x 10-18 mol/L and 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of sample) using a less sophisticated tape.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality, if its use on clinical specimens is successful.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors can only offer supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Tableau (Tableau2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from restored patients, Chinese medicine as well as psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been proposed for treatment.
Drug companies are all working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the main threat to patients, and the leading cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-throughput oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of critical heart or respiratory insufficiency.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
An overreaction of the immune system has been shown to cause cytokine shock in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFN, IFN, IFN and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shocks, especially for severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine shock include T-cell modulation of immune response, IFN-, IL-1, and TNF cytokine blockade, JAK inhibition, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 reporting suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, taking high-dose steroids did not have any beneficial effects on severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would cause serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, thus significantly affecting the prognosis.
Nevertheless, the careful use of short cycles of low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids has been recommended for patients with severe form of COVID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, was shown to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these findings, Gilead transmitted the compound to China to allow a number of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-?, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from restored patients and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease in order to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is an ancestral practice.
Indeed, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B cells to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who had cured COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, in association with a decrease in the phenomenon of inflammation, a reduction in the viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary in order to be able to propose this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat seriously ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and effective to isolate the B cells of restored patients and identify the genetic codes encoding the relevant antibodies or to look for effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used for millennia in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis, based on TCM theories.
Most effective components remain little or not at all known as it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal associations.
Currently, due to the lack of a specific effective treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or in remission of a severe form of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been shown to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest cure rates for COVID-19 were observed in provinces in China that used TCM for 87% of their patients, including Gansu Province (63.7%), Ningxia Region (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM for only 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a rather rough comparison since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, need to be considered for evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study comparing a treatment using Western medicine (MO) only and a combined treatment combining MO and TCM.
It was found that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time to resolve symptoms, and the length of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
More impressively, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% vs. 46.2%); similarly, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% vs. 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of TCM has yet to be clarified through controlled trials conducted on a larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally have a high level of concern about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those in quarantine also experience feelings of boredom, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, acute confusional state, and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt among patients about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma on family and friends.
Thus, mental health care must be provided to patients with COVID-19, individuals identified as probable cases, people in contact with these populations, and any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the chain of transmission from infected animal reservoirs and humans to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein vaccines to produce strong long-term neutralizing antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in the elderly and in models subjected to lethal provocation and their protection against infection with a zoonotic virus remains to be determined, as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is likely due to the fact that SARS became extinct 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using the inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles, and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential goal to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the significant delay (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations in coronaviruses.
Since it is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical evolution across thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most severe cases.
Therefore, establishing a prognosis model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies to date, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 are as follows (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main factor in the prognosis of SARS, and this also appears to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65 years, with 47.7% over 50 years according to a study conducted on 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to the positive cholangiocytes of ACE2, which can lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and the presence of underlying health problems are highly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage; it has been advanced as a potential predictor of disease, treatment response and cure.
The correlation between CRP levels and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also contribute to prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released in the event of tissue damage.
They are therefore traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest X-ray results and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with other elements for the determination of the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since taking high dose corticosteroids has been widely used for severe cases of SARS, many survivors have experienced avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental Stress: As described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a large number of cases of exceptional stress, with patients often experiencing long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and death of loved ones or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and return to a normal life.
Based on demographic studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and causes no or few symptoms in the first phase of infection, such as coronaviruses that cause common colds.
As a result, individuals recently infected or in incubation can produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, which significantly hampers control of the outbreak.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by seriously ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 epidemic is therefore far more serious and difficult to control than SARS.
Considerable efforts are currently being made in China, including the containment of Wuhan and surrounding cities, as well as the continued quarantine of almost the entire population with a view to halting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the outbreak will end in March and that the phase of decline will last 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believe that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not go out in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the outbreak and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in samples from the middle nasal cone and throat of recovered patients, 2 weeks after discharge from hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode like the flu.
However, encouraging signs have been seen in China with the gradual decline of new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to initial forecasts, the Ebola virus was expected to cause up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is possible, as with SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infectivity to eventually become extinct or that it evolves into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig.
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and also possibly through direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in stools, revealing a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 health professionals.
Precautionary measures should therefore be taken to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of patients, and even anyone who may be in contact with infected patients or persons.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of face masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 (1860) respirator masks helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition on surfaces, where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 (1860) masks provide protection against inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions able to fully penetrate; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the SARS-CoV in size, since both measure about 85 nm.
Since the particles manage to pass through five surgical masks stacked on top of each other, it is imperative that healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 (1860s) masks and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare professionals should wear tailored insulation gowns to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 even while wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body by eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent visors or goggles when in contact with patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended to wash your hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to remain confined to the maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected people.
It is advisable to maintain a distance of one meter with the patients.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China on high alert after the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the population that the new virus was minimally contagious, had limited human-to-human transmissibility, and would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a noticeable release, especially as the entire country prepared for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
China’s disease control agencies must learn from this and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, as each word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinic data rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or official agencies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential outbreak in its early stages rather than trying to reassure the population; and (4) conduct more targeted exercises to improve the population’s awareness and (4) conduct more targeted exercises.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing, it has spread to all of China as well as nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Since this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic gives rise to an impression of déjà-vu.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that need to be considered in order to contain the outbreak and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people and men more than women; the severity and mortality rate are also higher among older people.
SARS has higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by seriously ill patients, making it much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 has spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular tests for SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, recovered patients may be positive for the virus again.
This greatly increases the risk of spread.
Despite rapid advances in COVID-19 research, several critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where does the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 comes from chiroptera.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the virus from the initial host, for example bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing ACE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a quick and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during human-to-human transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or resurface regularly like the flu?
It is essential, even if it may take time, to get answers to all these questions as well as many others.
However, no matter how much it costs, we have no choice but to end this epidemic as soon as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only rare immunocompromised patients have experienced severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The first case of SARS occurred in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
Without counting the super-transmitters, it was estimated that each case could generate approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period between 4 and 7 days, the peak of the viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, distorted liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are common abnormalities seen in laboratory tests when SARS is suspected.
Diffuse alveolar lesions, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophages are also seen in patients with SARS.
About 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also become infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokine shock, which can be fatal especially in immunocompromised patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal swab of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present all over the world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
The same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present globally, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations of MERS resemble those of SARS and are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS compared to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses known to humans.
Diarrhoea is also seen in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparing and contrasting the SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs revealed some very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, the SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four community-based HCoVs (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and long-lasting spread after transmission to humans, will influence the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
The four community-based HCoVs causing moderate symptoms have adapted well to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to occur, HCoVs must replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restriction factors.
With this in mind, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the greater the number of people infected, the more likely the virus is to fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating among the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are highly pathogenic, have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is not sustainable.
They must maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among them without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV, it will be very useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of HCoV evolutionary hosts, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbors a close ascendant sharing a high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The original virus has often adapted well and is non-pathogenic to its host.
Similarly, a reservoir host houses HCoV continuously and over the long term.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, given that 80% of animals on the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals can also serve as amplifying intermediate hosts cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have laid the groundwork for a new concept that bats are hosts to emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite high homology between these two viruses, WIV1 is generally considered not to be the immediate relative of SARS-CoV and bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
This is why bats cannot be the intermediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels are HIV-positive with specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, as are camels from the Middle East found in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only through the airways, but also through the faecal tract, which is also the main route of excretion for bats.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less than that between the beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin.
Recombination is a widespread factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be derived from bat coV, whereas the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids were also suspected to be intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoVs from the bat near HCoV-229E were found.
First, unlike alpacas, humans can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
In contrast, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, the alpha-CoVs of bats related to HCoV-229E are numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alpha-CoV of alpaca caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
In reality, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while the bat's alpha-CoVs serve as the genetic reservoir for HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of cross-species transmission from bats to dromedaries and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV found in bats is known from its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in camels for decades.
It has adapted well in these camels who have gone from intermediate host to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Unlike the role of camels in transmitting MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in transmitting SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, the beta-CoVs of pangolin are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities for inter-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-like virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats via logging or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus by cutting and eating game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research into the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, estimated CoV mutation rates could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of 10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to new hosts.
Nevertheless, CoV mutation rates are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the CoVs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high mutation rate, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to humans.
It can be assumed that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Third, CoVs change model randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a unique “choice-copy” mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for animal-observed CoVs, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-Host Interaction in Connection with Transmission
Beyond these three viral factors indicated above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
Indeed, an electron cryomicroscopy study indicates an affinity 10 to 20 times greater than that observed between human ACE2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs, such as bats, dromedaries, and rodents, could be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Emergence of new HCoV: back to square one
The diversity of bat CoVs offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs are genetic reserves of HCoVs.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, as bat viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but codified divergent ORF8 proteins.
This suppression splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, in most nsp10s and in some nsp14s.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV outbreak experienced episodes of recombination between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
While ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, causing a reading frame shift.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their tank hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoV, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that bats had adapted well to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RODs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect exoribonuclease "replay", which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without provoking a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of observing asymptomatic carriers and what causes cases of severe infection in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of dissociation of the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection is expected to be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is failing in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat coV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-CoVs remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs have returned to the limelight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, along with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary human-animal contact.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity for contagion arises.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing transmission from animals to humans and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses reservoirs.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or quasi-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
It is possible to get respiratory diseases such as the flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The main medical goal of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals, which can be harmful or cause disease.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction of the infant mortality rate during home births.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as handwashing with soap.
Pneumonia, one of the leading IRAs, is the leading cause of death in children under five, killing nearly 1.8 million people a year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by scaly and itchy skin, and particularly common in health care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Deworming twice a year, combined with daily handwashing with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluoridated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic matter from the soil, are difficult to dissolve in water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic-resistant organisms in the wild.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, these may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protector, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).
The warm water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water at removing natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have found that using lukewarm water does not help reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to obtain a gel, or with a humectant such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively remove germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand sanitizer or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and quick removal of microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless you do not have soap and water at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions can lead to dry skin if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizers.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hives or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic materials on the hands, but only disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as these remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have exhibited long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness has been reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less so than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than curb it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Lather a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the backs of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of scrubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and scrubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a pool of stagnant water can lead to recontamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and moist hands recontaminate more easily.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the underside of the nails.
Artificial nails and chipped nail polish can host microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economical alternatives for washing hands when tap water and/or soap is not available. For example, dripping water from a can or can hung and drilled and/or using ash if needed, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are options for "saving water" such as "saving water" and "saving water" in developing countries.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a pitcher suspended using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a loaf of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is a matter of debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in the toilet.
After washing and drying hands in the hot air hand dryer, it was revealed that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the pulp of the fingers and 254% on the palms.
Drying with an air jet hand dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp of 42% and on the palms of 15%.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Handwashing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed against each other as they pass between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the faucet (and open the exit door if necessary).
The goal of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsing, it is necessary to prevent water on the forearms from flowing to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was discovered that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increasing the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
For example, in most of rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build handwashing stations.
Nevertheless, low handwashing rates can also be due to stubborn habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to the final three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of the campaigns to promote hand hygiene that are carried out in order to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that claims to foment behavioural change.Following the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to fetid odors called miasmas.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating “good hand washing techniques” were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in toilets in office buildings and airports.
The term “washing hands” refers to a person’s refusal to take responsibility or be complicit in something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other “purification” compensatory measures, such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.

It should also be stressed that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in virus genomes, which are most likely due to the pressures exerted during selection, particularly by the host's immune system.
An example is the loss of complete ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E, due to a deletion of two nucleotides.
While ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, causing a reading frame shift.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their tank hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoV, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that bats had adapted well to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by the positive regulation of the NKG2/CD94 receptor inhibiting natural killer cells and by the low expression rate of the molecules of the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RODs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect exoribonuclease "replay", which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without provoking a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of observing asymptomatic carriers and what causes cases of severe infection in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of dissociation of the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection is expected to be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is failing in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat coV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other commercially available animals have been found to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence to indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 was man-made, either voluntarily or accidentally.
CoVs have returned to the limelight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has greatly altered our perception of the role that zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs play in the transmission of HCoVs to humans.
Numerous factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Because SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and civets in markets, the closure of markets for fresh produce and the slaughter of civets in those markets could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from fresh product markets to avoid transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of many pangolin beta-CoV lines closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, if so, how this transmission occurs, will remain to be determined in subsequent studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, along with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
There is no shortage of opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or lethal CoVs in humans in the future.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary human-animal contact.
In response to the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity for contagion arises.
Although bats have many virus-promoting characteristics, the likelihood of humans coming into contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized if people are made aware of the need to stay away.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing transmission from animals to humans and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses reservoirs.
We do not yet know all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or quasi-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Future research in this area will help to elucidate the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updated diagnostic criteria for “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19 are needed
On February 6, 2020, our team issued a Rapid Referral Guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this guideline described our experience and provided references to combat this pandemic globally.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge is gradually progressing based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment regarding our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a “suspicious case” and a “confirmed case” according to the latest COVID-19 (seventh version) diagnostic and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak that is now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO called COVID-19 a pandemic.
To be able to fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge is slowly progressing based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) had a total of seven editions between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, some of which were substantially modified.
Our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., who submitted a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We welcome their important work and thank them.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (test seventh version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), confirmation of a suspected case must combine one of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical events to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical events in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and neighboring areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with previous or previous symptoms
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging showing the characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte counts at the onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the suspect case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome exhibiting strong homogeneity with novel coronaviruses; (3) positive serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody; or modification of the IgV-2 IgG antibody-specific antibody.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or in blood samples was added in the second edition (January 18, 2020) and in the third edition (January 22, 2020).
Pathogenic screening of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes build on the researchers’ ongoing work to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as airway samples including blood collection, with increased availability of different specimens, and contributed to the addition of the positive result of the specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of caution when it comes to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphical representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The evaluation system must also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope for more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases”, we suggest that they follow and comply with the most recent guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our guidance in a timely manner to offer assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new COVID-19-related deaths, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19-related deaths in a single day.
The country thus records a record death due to the virus in a single day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of people infected registered included 114 active cases and 33 people cured, who remained confined to their homes.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transportation of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was always allowed.
By March 19, these three people had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city’s lockdown until May 1.
The Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the trend to reveal just how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection can be.
Most HCoVs come from bats in which they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate tank hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of CoV-host interactions in animals could also lead to a better understanding of CoV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV). The genus Beta-CoV contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The tracing of zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and limiting factors of crossing the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, intermediate and amplifier host(s), with important implications in preventing future contagions.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had classic cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise, and sore throat, with fever and cough observed in 10 to 20% of cases.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are found all over the world and appear to be transmitted mainly in winter in temperate climate countries.
Shops in Australia reduce toilet paper limits per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles reduced their toilet paper purchase restrictions to two and one package per purchase at all stores nationwide, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit.
These limits were posted as messages at checkouts and on channels’ Facebook pages.
Buyers were apparently hoarding supplies out of fear of COVID-19 and the need to confine themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted toilet paper purchases for home deliveries to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, said that with the four-package restriction in effect, “many stores are still out of stock within an hour of delivery,” and called the request “unprecedented,” while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it “unexpected.”
Sales saw a “strong increase” last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the allowed quantity to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made stocks available earlier for a promotion scheduled for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult.
It predicts higher production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some stores are not able to honor the Wednesday promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert on the distribution sector at Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores replenish stocks every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a voluminous item, resulting in a reduced amount of inventory that, when exhausted, leaves large empty spaces in shelves, reinforcing the impression of a shortage.
“Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the shelves are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, it’s likely to reduce panic,” Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who makes Sorbent paper, pointed out that they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to the News.com.au article.
Domain.com, a real estate site, said some property sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were being held because buyers were on leave during the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 ABC Australia report in which they said they did not plan to introduce purchase restrictions.
Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry goods, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed Sunday night that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-reel packs.
World Health Organization calls COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the current outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) a pandemic.
Although the word “pandemic” refers only to the degree of spread of the disease, and not to the dangerousness of specific cases, the WHO has indicated the need to push governments to take action:
“All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
“We are deeply concerned, not only by the alarming levels of spread and severity, but also by the alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said, in remarks published by CNN in February, that “apart from the flu, no other respiratory viruses have been observed since its onset until its continued spread globally.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that “we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.”
He added: “And we’ve never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.”
The new pandemic status follows WHO’s decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: “In short, the situation is going to get worse.”
On Thursday, the Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing coronavirus disease outbreak since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are healed.
The fatality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to cough, staying away from other people, as well as monitoring and confining people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded with travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures.
The pandemic has led to severe global socio-economic disruptions, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages compounded by panic shopping.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the global student population.
False information about the virus has been circulating on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, as well as other people from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and closures in heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported an outbreak of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was opened in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and closely related to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first known person with symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019, and this person had no obvious link to the subsequent focus of the fresh produce market.
Of the first outbreak cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have a link to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could date back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old person in Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases appeared to decrease in China but suddenly increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There could be a strong underestimation of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide, and the UK’s Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population needed to be infected before they could achieve effective collective immunity.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, up to January 23, 86% of undetected COVID-19 infections were estimated to be the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the cases reported.
The first estimates of the basic reproductive rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not recover, the time between the onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80 percent of deaths were in people over the age of 60, and 75 percent were suffering from pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Official counts of deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to deceased people who have tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual number of COVID-19 victims may be much higher, as it may not include untested deceased people - e.g., at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy reveal that the numbers of excess deaths during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count of COVID deaths.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged “We know that [the reported number of deaths] is understated,” a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of undervaluation in the U.S. Such underestimation often occurs during pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On February 28, more than a dozen deaths per country were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica, and several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak began, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and especially health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case-to-death ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the case-to-death ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms that appeared between January 1 and January 10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms that appeared after February 1, 2020). Other indicators are the fatality rate (lethality rate), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who succumb to a disease, and the infection rate (infection rate), which represents the percentage of those diagnosed who succumb to a disease, and the infection rate (infection rate), which represents the percentage of those diagnosed.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the overall infection rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomised tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the impact of the tests on lethality rate estimates.
The WHO argues that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said: “Without control, infectious epidemics usually stabilize and then begin to regress when the disease comes to run out of available hosts.
But it’s almost impossible to make any relevant predictions right now about when that will happen.”
Chinese government chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said “it could be over by June” if all countries manage to mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two.”
According to a study by Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be needed “until a vaccine is available (possibly in 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus – because it’s transmitted very easily – will completely disappear” and that it “could turn into a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year.”
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis.The WHO says that about one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakenings, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present. Subsequent course of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, and shock.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm the infection, so the researchers issued recommendations that people who had close contact with infected confirmed people should be closely monitored and screened to rule out the risk of infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is more often five days. Good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who have lost their sense of smell was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information about how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly during close contact and by fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without protection can throw droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by fine droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods of time, which could be projected by speaking; respiratory droplets can also be projected by exhalation, including speaking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
Postilions can land in the mouth or nose of other people next to them or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Certain medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and therefore lead to aerial propagation.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, such as the skin, before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it can be transmitted through stool, this risk is considered to be low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious for the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in advanced stages of the disease.
People tested positive for the disease up to three days before symptoms occurred suggesting that transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact tracing surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not yet clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives for hours or even days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus could be detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however UK authorities recommend washing your hands after touching animals, such as after coming into contact with other surfaces that infected people might have touched.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia linked to the Wuhan Acute Respiratory Disease case outbreak.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be of zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, to the subgenus Sarbecovirus (line B) associated with two strains from bats.
It is 96% identical to the entire genome of another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in some parts of the genome sequences between viruses from pangolins and those from humans.
Comparing the entire genome to date has revealed a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Infection with the virus can be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however the final confirmation is done by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scan.
A study comparing PCR and scanner in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less accurate, as many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that “the scanner not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.”
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on January 17.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available in a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed on a rhinopharyngeal sample, but a throat sample can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and CT scans of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral frosted glass opacities and a lack of pleural effusion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation is of limited accuracy to detect COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of chest scans to PCR and demonstrated that while imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating its use as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect virus characteristics in imaging on both X-rays and scanners.
Prevention strategies for disease transmission include overall good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.
Those who were previously infected were recommended to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission; many Governments have prohibited or discouraged all non-essential travel to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus is spreading in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been infected. Health professionals caring for someone who may be infected are advised to take the usual precautions, contact precautions, and wear goggles. Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to identify the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
Governments’ use of mobile phone location data in this regard has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits to such surveillance.
Various mobile apps were launched or offered on a voluntary basis, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s presence near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are currently circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing your nose and gargle with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no such thing as a COVID-19 vaccine, but many organizations are currently working to develop one.
It is advisable to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after being in the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after having puffed, coughed, or sneezed.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated in several ways (within one minute of disinfectant exposure for a stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% iodine povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or a crèche, all rooms such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and vending machines used by sick people, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their bent elbow or a handkerchief when they cough or sneeze, and throw away any handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, because wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance traveled by the projected postilions by talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions that explain where and when to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “wearing a mask can reduce people’s propensity to touch their face, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene.”
WHO has recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they face a significant risk, such as caring for a patient with COVID-19, even though it recognizes that wearing the mask can help people not touch their faces.
Several countries have started encouraging their people to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical cloth masks. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks to healthy people, especially in cases of proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or crowded places.
In Thailand, health authorities are encouraging people to make face masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public outings without masks or other means of covering his nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the wearing of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone protects themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered anyone entering a supermarket to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, imposed the wearing of the mask on intercity train and bus passengers on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask for any outing, while recommending the manufacture of a handmade mask to those who cannot buy one.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to slow the spread of the disease by decreasing contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions, and closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping malls.
One can apply the methods of social distancing by staying at home, limiting one’s travels, avoiding crowds, greeting oneself without contact and keeping a physical distance from others.
Many governments are now ordering or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by U.S. government and health agencies was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension or a weakened immune system experience an increased risk of serious illness and complications. They were thus urged by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas affected by the outbreak.
The use of the term "social distancing" suggested that full social isolation should be used, rather than encouraging people to keep in touch with others through other means.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sex only with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or have symptoms.
Home isolation has been recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who think they may be infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation, and many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most at-risk groups.
People who have been exposed to a COVID-19 patient and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with very high transmission were asked to quarantine for 14 days from the time they were last exposed.
Strategies for controlling an epidemic are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
Containment is implemented during the early stages of the epidemic and aims to track and isolate infected people, as well as introduce other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are shifting to the mitigation phase: action is being taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures, in order to inflect the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproduction to less than 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saves time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and individual quarantine; public social distancing measures such as the closure of schools and religious offices; a public effort to encourage acceptance of and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental actions such as cleaning up surfaces.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and localized quarantine, and issued alerts on the movement of infected people.
Singapore has provided financial support to infected people who have been quarantined, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are overwhelmed.
Removal may be preferred, but should be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that happens first), because otherwise, transmission rebounds rapidly when measures are released.
The long-term response to the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing treatments.
Taking non-prescription cold medications or drinking beverages as well as rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO said some “traditional and artisanal remedies” can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing the capacity and adaptation of health care for the needs of patients with COVID-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental response measure to the epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for redeployment of resources at different levels, including dedicating laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, cancelling non-emergency interventions where possible, separating and isolating COVID-19-positive patients, and building capacity for intensive care.
There are various theories regarding the place of origin of the very first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the novel coronavirus could date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
They are usually linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the hospital of Hubei province, who informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a “SRAS-like coronavirus.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to Wuhan health authorities to trigger an investigation in early January, with the number of cases doubling about every seven and a half days in the early stages of the outbreak.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by Chinese New Year migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub as well as a major railway connecting point.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States overtook China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 were cured.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted travel and implemented border controls.
National responses have included containment measures such as quarantines (also known as orders to stay at home, on-site shelter or containment) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are subject to some form of containment in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were experiencing some form of containment, a figure that rose to 2.6 billion two days later – about a third of the world’s population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the very first case would date back to November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an outbreak of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 26, which she informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan have received a warning for “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no “clear evidence” of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping as a “people’s war” to stem the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as “the largest quarantine in human history,” a cordon sanitaire was announced on January 23 to halt travel to and from Wuhan, which has been extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles has been banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was later built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as congress centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.On January 26, the government introduced new measures to stem the COVID-19 epidemic, including issuing health declarations for travelers and extending the Spring Day holiday.
The country’s universities and schools have also been closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have instituted several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote working measures have been introduced in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions have been adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been changed and China’s museums have been temporarily closed.
Control of population movement has been applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) have faced some form of movement restriction.After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being “imported” from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine on all international travellers entering the city. As of March 23, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted inside the country in the previous five days, in this case via a traveller returning to Canton from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Premier Li Keqiang said that the spread of cases transmitted inside the country was essentially blocked, and that the outbreak was controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the start of the lockdown.The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March 26, 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from March 28, without specifying when this policy was to end.
People who wish to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on March 30, and granted monetary stimulus plans to companies. The State Council announced a day of mourning to begin with three minutes of silence on April 4 at 10:00 a.m., coinciding with Qingming Day, although the central government asked families to pay tribute online to respect physical distancing and avoid a repeat of the COVID-19 outbreak.
COVID-19 has been confirmed to have spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
The nation’s health organization reported a dramatic increase in confirmed cases on Feb. 20, largely attributed to a rally in Daegu of a new religious movement called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji worshippers visiting Daegu from Wuhan were suspected to have been the cause of the outbreak.
On February 22, of the church’s 9,336 worshippers, 1,261 or about 13% reported symptoms, with South Korea announcing the highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, followed by 3,150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea were quarantined after three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world to test the population for the virus, isolate all infected people, and track and quarantine people who have been in contact with them.
Screening methods included mandatory individual symptom reporting by international newcomers via a mobile app, virus screening drives delivering results the next day, and increased testing capacity to allow testing of nearly 20,000 people each day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the epidemic, although it has not quarantined entire cities. The South Korean company was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment for mismanagement of the epidemic by the government or instead praising his reaction.
On March 23, South Korea experienced the lowest number of daily cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was announced that from April 1, all people arriving from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.

The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as one of the most flexible among the affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the UK government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has been criticized for its manifest lack of responsiveness and liveliness in response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement, advising against all non-essential travel and social contacts, suggesting that people work from home if possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and performance venues.
On March 20, the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and gyms should close as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80 percent of workers' wages, up to a limit of 2,500 euros per month, in order to avoid crisis-related unemployment.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control, the U.S. government’s leading public health institute, announced that it had developed its own screening kit.
Despite this, the U.S. took a long time to start testing, which obscured the true extent of the outbreak at that time.
The tests were marred by faulty screening kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal approval for non-government screening kits (universities, businesses and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for eligibility for a test until early March (a mandatory doctor’s prescription thereafter).
On February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.

Medical screening was conducted prior to departure and four South Africans who showed signs of coronavirus remained on the scene to reduce the risk.
Only South Africans who tested negative were repatriated.
The test results exempted all South Africans, including crew members, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, who, as a precautionary measure, all remained under observation and quarantine for a period of 14 days at the Ranch Resort.
On March 20, the United States began partially withdrawing its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.

He then sent 5,000 screening kits, 100,000 protective masks and 5 respirators to Panama.
Ma has also donated medical equipment to Canada, and the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic have expressed concerns about masks and screening kits made in China.
For example, Spain removed 58,000 coronavirus screening kits made in China with an accuracy rate of only 30%, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese protective masks.
Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks; they were thought to have come from China, but they were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in the Latin American and African regions, and on 2 April the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic.
The WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities had been accused of cover-up that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government “provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the Lunar New Year.”
On 23 January, in response to the decision by the central authorities to apply a travel ban to Wuhan, WHO Representative Gauden Galea noted that while this was "certainly not a WHO recommendation", it was nevertheless a "very important indication of the commitment to contain the outbreak where it is most concentrated", and he spoke of a "unprecedented" occurrence in China.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the USPPI was due to the “risk of global spread, especially for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros said: “There is no reason for measures to unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” and “WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel.”
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgent need to support those countries that “do not have the systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it is about to appear.”
Tedros went on to say that we were “as strong as our weakest link” and urged the international community to “invest today or pay more tomorrow.” On 11 February, WHO established in a press conference that the disease was called COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to integrate the “strength of the entire UN system into the response.”
A UN crisis management team has been activated to coordinate the entire UN response, which WHO says will allow them to “focus on the health response while other agencies can contribute their expertise to manage the broader social, economic and development implications of the epidemic.”
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team was activated in China to dispatch international and WHO experts to China to support national management and assess "severity and transmission of the disease" by organizing workshops and meetings with major national institutions and conduct field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels that may occur in the rural areas."
In response to the development of the outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO representatives said that the global coronavirus threat assessment had gone from “high” to “very high”, its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s health emergency management program, said in a statement: “This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to get ready,” adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid the “worst.”
Ryan went on to say that the current data does not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, adding that such a statement would mean “we absolutely accept that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus.”
On 11 March, the WHO said the coronavirus outbreak could be described as a pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO was “extremely concerned by both alarming levels of spread and severity and alarming levels of inaction.” The WHO has faced significant criticism for its management of the pandemic, which is considered inadequate, including due to the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition urging WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to tender his resignation, signed by 733,000 people by 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone was entitled to relief assistance and that the responsibility lay with the Government.
The group insisted that lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that every individual has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, belonging to minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a platform that provides timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in different countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
Between strengthening health systems and the global economy and responding to the effects of containment and travel restrictions, the digital platform includes a Country Policy Tracker tool to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the challenge posed by the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British cabinet minister Michael Gove and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for its handling of the pandemic, which began in China’s Hubei province.
Several provincial administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been relieved of their duties following their management of the quarantine in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political leaders to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe this action was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from popular anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some senior Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, have rejected the original idea that the coronavirus outbreak started in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories arguing that COVID-19 would have its origins in the United States or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump called the coronavirus a “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus,” stating that in China “censorship has supercharged a virus that has now become a global pandemic,” which was later labeled as racism by some opponents and intended to “distract attention from his administration’s inability to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government outlining a communications ploy apparently emanating from the National Security Council, the strategy of which is quoted as follows: “Everything comes from China.
We are being asked to try to communicate this message in every possible way, including at press conferences and television appearances." News outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda push to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there was “a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and ‘generosity politics’.”
Borrell also said that “China aggressively insists that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called on the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while a priori sending aid to the latter two countries.
The 100,000 masks given by Jack Ma to Cuba were blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own countries.
And other mask-related conflicts have also been reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the EU, said: “Only China has responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous “high-ranking political source” who said that 80 percent of Russian aid was “little if any useful for Italy.”
The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive of “geopolitical and diplomatic” charm.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane loaded with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “by offering his help to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment gain speed, they will be able to return the favor if necessary.”
The scale of NATO’s planned Defender 2020 military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltics, NATO’s biggest maneuver since the end of the Cold War, will be reduced.
Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized Exercise Defender 2020: “In the current public health crisis, it endangers not only the lives of American troops and many participating European countries, but also the lives of the people of the countries in which they operate.” The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about 20 members of parliament infected, as well as 15 other former or current political figures.
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, stating that his country was struggling to fight the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets due to U.S. sanctions on Iran.The outbreak prompted calls for the U.S. to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal child care program, and a universal child care program.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election, as diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan’s “ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts” after the latter announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be impeached for mismanagement of the epidemic by the government or instead praising his response.The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this could allow governments to strengthen their power.
Hungary’s parliament has voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by decree until further notice, suspend parliament and elections, and punish anyone accused of spreading false information about the virus and the government’s handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several cases of supply disruptions, stemming from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the outbreak, panic shopping, and a disruption in plant and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier disruption.
Several localities have also faced panic shopping resulting in the disappearance of basic necessities, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, from the shelves, leading to shortages.
The technology sector, in particular, has alerted to delays in shipping electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand led to an increase in prices of up to 20 times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
It has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world and the WHO warns that it will put health professionals at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigus to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food products that followed, these two areas were spared from severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the storage and illegal trade of essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the severe food shortages that had been expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Thanks to its large agricultural production, Northern Italy has not seen a significant decline, but prices could rise according to industry representatives.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials unblocked pork supplies to ensure sufficient livelihood for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy for food producers to store reserves for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the global economy were felt in China: according to a March 16 media report, the Chinese economy was hit very hard in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell 20.5 percent.
Mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing hub, and the viral epidemic has been identified as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain unstable until a clearer picture emerged of potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed that of the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis has estimated an impact of more than $300 billion on the global supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is said to have "stuck" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to lower demand in China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 following a significant increase in COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concern about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indexes including the NASDAQ-100, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average posted their sharpest falls since 2008, with a Dow Jones down to 1,191 points, the largest drop in a day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three indices ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China’s sovereign debt rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Shares fell again due to fears related to the coronavirus, with the largest decline seen on March 16.
Many believe that an economic recession is likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures put in place by central banks and states.
Central banks are reacting faster than they did during the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations against travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe went bankrupt.
The impact on the cruise industry has reached a level never seen before.
Several ferry stations and ports have also been closed.
The outbreak coincided with Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the Chinese New Year.
A number of events involving large crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including annual New Year’s festivities, and private companies have also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year-related events have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including Beijing Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities have extended the New Year’s holiday until Feb. 10, requiring most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has moved to its highest level of infectious disease response and declared an emergency, shutting down schools until March and cancelling its New Year festivities. The retail sector has been impacted globally, with store opening hours cut or temporary closures.
Visits to merchants in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders saw a 50 to 60 percent decline.
This also led to a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic in shopping malls in March compared to February.
Mall operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increasing cleaning frequencies, installing thermal scanners to control customer temperatures, and cancelling events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America compared to a situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large proportion of the roughly 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves stranded at home in inland provinces or stranded in Hubei Province. As of March 2020, more than 10 million Americans have lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily wage) unemployed. The Angus Reid Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian households had experienced some type of unemployment.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit, and nearly half a million German companies switched their employees to a government-subsidized partial-activity scheme called Kurzarbeit.
The German part-time work compensation scheme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, impacting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both salaried and self-employed, globally.
Arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often funded by the state) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, to ensure the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists wherever possible.
In March 2020, worldwide and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues and other cultural institutions were closed until further notice and their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intense efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican has announced that the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place in the last week of the Lenten period of Christian penance, have been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday Masses; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online and live or on television while others offer to practice their “drive-in” worship.
Like the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome which closed its churches and chapels and St. Peter’s Square which emptied itself of all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran’s health minister announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and the holy sites were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the biggest disruption to the global sporting calendar since World War II.
The most important sporting events were either cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 English Football Championship, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be “rescheduled beyond 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021.” Casinos and other gaming establishments around the world have closed and live poker tournaments have been either postponed or cancelled.
This has prompted many players to sign up online, and many online gaming sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new sign-ups. The entertainment world has also been hit, with several music groups having suspended or canceled their concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as those on Broadway, have also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet instead of traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online “festivals” created for artists to perform, broadcast and promote their works.
Online, many coronavirus-themed internet memes have spread because many favor humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 epidemic, there has been an upsurge in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports dating back to February (while the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist sentiments expressed in different groups around the world that the Chinese deserved the virus or were receiving a justifiable punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been provided to the Chinese, both online and offline, and to residents in areas affected by the virus.
As the epidemic spreads to new and more sensitive countries, Italians in Europe's first major COVID-19 outbreak could also face suspicion and xenophobia, with citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signing petitions to ban Chinese from entering their country to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag .ChineseDontComeToJapan was all the rage on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians living in the UK and the US have reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as assaults.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a “Chinese virus,” a term seen by his critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and studying in major Indian cities have reportedly been harassed in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them".
The remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata as “false.” In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents were fuelled by the pandemic, with foreigners described as “foreign waste” that should be “disposed.”
Many paid-access newspapers have removed them for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers have made available their scientific articles related to the epidemic in open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their findings quickly on prepublication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory screening for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including people whose symptoms were too mild to report or people who were asymptomatic.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population as of March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests conducted in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect reported lethality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including the nasopharyngeal swab or the sputum sample.
The results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed from pharyngeal swabs is only reliable during the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus can disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected individuals tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken from the deep respiratory tract by suction catheter, or sputum (sputum) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis for 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The South Korean company Kogenebiotech also developed a clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the “E” gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization from the Chinese National Administration of Medical Products for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR.In the United States, the Centers for Control and Control
Of the older versions of the test kits, one in three genetic tests had inconclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a test bottleneck at the Atlanta CDC, resulting in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only then did federal and local laboratories receive authorization to begin screening.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began screening in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp has announced the national availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced, and the collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Research Center in Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on the Abbott m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a U.S.A. from the FDA for a test taking about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the U.S., and Abbott plans to ramp up manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the novel coronavirus’ nucleocapsid (N-protein) protein is under development in Taiwan, hoping it can deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes, such as a rapid flu test.
A March 2020 bibliographic study concluded that “pulmonary X-rays have a low diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [tomodensitometry] results may be conclusive even before symptoms appear.”
Among the typical symptoms visible on CT are multi-lobary bilateral frosted glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
A subpleural predominance, a “crazy paving” and a consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less accurate, with many of its imaging results coinciding with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommended that “MDT not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.”
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and as part of population monitoring.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (TLC) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
The automated high-throughput systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of performing these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, a single peripheral blood sample is usually used, although serial samples can be used in order to track the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required before analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the agency and therefore can now distribute their antibody testing.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours, which is significantly faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country were performing well enough to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan under which suspected cases can stay at home, "the emergency department will provide the patient with a sample tube", patients spit inside, return him and later receive the test result.The British NHS announced that it is conducting a pilot project to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk that one patient is infecting another case by going to a hospital or hospital.
The “drive” centers have enabled South Korea to perform one of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it had the ability to perform some 12,000 tests per day in an outpatient setting, and that 10,700 patients had been tested in the previous week.
Costs are covered by health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive tests were available in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that at the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to and including 12/2020 week and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) achieved a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from the Technion and Rambam Hospital have developed and tested a method of analyzing samples from 64 patients at a time.
Thanks to its 5-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modelling revealed that cases in Hubei province would have been 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capacity.
Wuhan’s lab was quickly followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
As of March 4, 2020, total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplexed free models developed by Origami Assays have been published to test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be run in small laboratories without a liquid-handling robot.
In March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagent became a bottleneck for mass screening in the EU, UK and US.
This situation prompted some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes in order to continue screening.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now the country testing most of its per capita population for Coronavirus, and were in the process of intensifying screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were achieved through a combination of the ability to conduct drive tests and the purchase of a population-wide high-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their “Huo-Yan” emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first lab of this capability to be operational outside of China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula for making kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was released on January 17, 2020. The protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was only released on January 28, delaying the availability of tests in the U.S. China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide enough specialist kits to meet the demand.
In contrast, experts say the high availability of testing in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Screening capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization recommended scaling up screening programs as the best way to slow the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of tests to be delayed in private laboratories in the United States, and the reserves of swabs and chemical reagents have run out.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had “flaws” and the government eliminated bureaucratic barriers to private testing. Spain purchased test kits from China’s Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results were unreliable.
The company explained that the erroneous results could be related to the inability to collect samples or properly use the kits.
The Spanish ministry said it will remove the kits that gave the wrong results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic provided false results.Slovakia has purchased from China 1.2 million test kits that have proven to be faulty.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ate Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them". The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
The screening, followed by the 40 or so positive test subjects and the tracing of contacts with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, gave positive results.
The researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, the site of the first COVID-19-related death in Italy, conducted two series of tests with the entire population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Nearly half of the people with a positive result had no symptoms, and all cases discovered were quarantined.
With the restriction of movement in the commune, this measure completely eliminated new infections.
Thanks to aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much slower than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on the date scheduled for the end of the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic using aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive containment, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that the countries with the most tests, relative to the number of deaths, have much lower lethality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with limited COVID-19 experience send their first five positive and 10 negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO’s 16 reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column “Positive as a % of tests” depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests only those admitted to hospital will have a positive value in % of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning your hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Systematically washing your hands with soap at certain "key times" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the oro-fecal route.
It is possible to get respiratory diseases such as the flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you don't have soap or water on hand, you can wash your hands with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
after changing the diapers of a baby or cleaning a child who has gone to the toilet;
after coughing or coughing/sneezing;
after touching an animal, feed or waste of animal origin;
Hand hygiene in medical settings refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering medication or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical goal of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals, which can be harmful or cause disease.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction of the infant mortality rate during home births.
According to a 2013 study, improving hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by nearly 50%.
Actions to promote handwashing could reduce diarrhoea by about a third, a figure comparable to that obtained by supplying drinking water to low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap reduces diarrhea by 48 percent and is the most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs), an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the leading IRAs, is the leading cause of death in children under five, killing nearly 1.8 million people a year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, getting into the habit of washing your hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce diarrhea deaths by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is generally associated with other sanitary measures under the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by scaly and itchy skin, and particularly common in health care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilet (mice, defecation), after cleaning a baby's buttocks (or changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Hands should also be washed properly to prevent the transmission of disease, including before and after a cut or injury, after sneezing, coughing or frothing, after touching animal waste or handling animals, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand cleaning with soap is low.
According to a 2015 study of 54 countries on hand hygiene, 38.7% of households on average washed their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77%) and China had the lowest rate (23%).
For example, the Philippine Department of Education has implemented a "Primary Health Care Program" to promote children's health and education.
Deworming twice a year, combined with daily handwashing with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluoridated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate microorganisms present on the skin, soaps or detergents should be added to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic matter from the soil, are difficult to dissolve in water.
Proper water flow, however, makes cleaning easier.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the transfer is unlikely because the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that “liquid soap vending machines are preferable.”
Antibacterial soaps have been highly recommended for people who are concerned about their health.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic-resistant organisms in the wild.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, these may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protector, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).
The warm water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water at removing natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have found that using lukewarm water does not help reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based non-aqueous hand hygiene products (commonly referred to as hydroalcoholic solutions, hand antiseptic solutions, or hand sanitizers) began to become popular.
Most are formulated with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to obtain a gel, or with a humectant such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively remove germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Water-alcohol solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (a reduction of 3.5, log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of the bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (a reduction of 4 to 5 log) of the bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand sanitizer or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands and the gaps between the fingers and nails should be faced for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than the use of water-alcohol solutions, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and quick removal of microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless you do not have soap and water at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions can lead to dry skin if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizers.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hives or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than handwashing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic materials on the hands, but only disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as these remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have exhibited long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness has been reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many are unable to afford soap, and instead use ash or land.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less so than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than curb it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands properly to prevent disease transmission, following these steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Lather a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the backs of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of scrubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and scrubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a pool of stagnant water can lead to recontamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and moist hands recontaminate more easily.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the underside of the nails.
Artificial nails and chipped nail polish can host microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economical alternatives for washing hands when tap water and/or soap is not available. For example, dripping water from a can or can hung and drilled and/or using ash if needed, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are options for "saving water" such as "saving water" and "saving water" in developing countries.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a pitcher suspended using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a loaf of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is a matter of debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in the toilet.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper towel industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London), to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and more modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands in the hot air hand dryer, it was revealed that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the pulp of the fingers and 254% on the palms.
Drying with an air jet hand dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp of 42% and on the palms of 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by 76% on average on the pulp of the fingers and up to 77% on the palms.The scientists also conducted tests to determine if there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the toilet environment depending on each drying method.
The air jet hand dryer, which blows air out of the device at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hands and the device and possibly contaminating other toilet users as well as the toilet environment within a perimeter of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer makes it possible to diffuse microorganisms at a maximum distance of 0.25 meters from the hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms; in 2005, in a study conducted by TV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Handwashing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing in a medical setting became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use led to a decrease in infection rates.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed against each other as they pass between the fingers.
In case of residue under the nails, it is possible to use a bristle brush to remove them.
Since germs in the water are likely to remain on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the faucet (and open the exit door if necessary).
This helps to avoid re-contaminate hands when in contact with surfaces.
The goal of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that insufficient hand cleaning rates remain unacceptable in most medical facilities, with many doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to a study, properly washing your hands and following other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure for washing and rubbing your hands in the health field.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines prepared by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to gather feedback from Internet users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercially available devices can measure and certify hand hygiene, if compliance with the regulations is proven.
The World Health Organization defines "Five indications" for hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
After contact with the patient, adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap ("drug" or "antimicrobial" soaps) gives the hand washing agent a germ-killing action.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing surgery or in environments where antibiotic resistant organisms are widespread. To ""rub"" hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, a washing product based on chlorhexidine or iodine, sterile towels to have the hands dry.
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsing, it is necessary to prevent water on the forearms from flowing to the hands.
Once your hands have been washed, you should dry your hands with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical cassack.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was discovered that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increasing the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
If we compare handwashing with regular soap with antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher, and if we compare handwashing with alcohol-based solution and handwashing with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds each, we find that the former reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the latter.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products in reducing influenza A (H1N1) and Clostridium difficile spores on the hands.In order to improve hand hygiene in healthcare facilities, it is possible to train staff in hand washing, put more alcohol-based products at their disposal and send them written reminders.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered to be an inexpensive and essential tool for maintaining health and even feeding properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities to wash hands at home, at school and in the workplace, it is difficult to achieve universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in most of rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build handwashing stations.
Nevertheless, low handwashing rates can also be due to stubborn habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and raising awareness of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, publicize the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavioural change in the population.
For this approach to succeed, monitoring and evaluation activities are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that local approaches are effective in increasing handwashing rates in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. Regarding the promotion of handwashing in schools, we can cite the example of UNICEF's "Three Star Approach", which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands thoroughly.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to the final three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of the campaigns to promote hand hygiene that are carried out in order to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that claims to foment behavioural change.Following the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries relative to the number of healthy life years gained (i.e. DALYs avoided).
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who had just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to fetid odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne epidemics and nosocomial infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to guard against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating “good hand washing techniques” were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in toilets in office buildings and airports.
The term “washing hands” refers to a person’s refusal to take responsibility or be complicit in something.
It comes from a biblical verse in Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth undertakes to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, a symbol of her bad conscience in the face of the crimes she committed and which she incited her husband to commit.
It was also found that some people, after remembering or considering unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and value hand-washing devices more.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other “purification” compensatory measures, such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe handwashing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, which consists in using water and not soap to wash hands, is one of the handwashing rituals put forth in many religions, including Baha'i and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual ablution of hands (Nétilat Yaday).
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.
Controls of COVID-19 risks in the workplace
Workplace COVID-19 risk controls refer to the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls vary by workplace and task, based on an assessment of the risks of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs at lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other collaborators, in which case only basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory labeling, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection.
Medium-exposure jobs include those requiring frequent or close contact with people without suspected or known COVID-19, but who may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, including schools, high-density work environments, and some high-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly efficient air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of personal protective equipment in the event of an encounter with a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to people with suspected or known COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, switching to a very high risk if they perform procedures that produce aerosols or take or handle samples of people with suspected or known COVID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have become ill, have to take care of other people, or fear possible exposure.
Business models can change, both in terms of the goods requested and the means to acquire them (including shopping outside peak hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, shipments of items from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted, and an infectious disease preparedness and response plan may be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account the risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, family and community context risk factors, and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic conditions.
They also outline the necessary controls to address these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
Epidemic response goals include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining business operations, and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The Hierarchy of Risk Controls is an overall framework used in occupational health and safety to group risk controls by effectiveness.
When the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on worker behaviour and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls refer to changes in workplace policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the worker’s risk, properly adapted as needed (e.g., breathing masks), worn correctly and consistently, inspected regularly, maintained and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs at lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other collaborators.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, respiratory labeling including covering the mouth and nose for coughing and sneezing, providing handkerchiefs and trash cans, preparing for telework or staggered work hours as needed, deterring workers from using other cleaning tools and equipment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious people is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the U.S. recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay home until they no longer have fever, signs of fever, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of febrifuges or other medications acting on the symptoms. They also advise to apply flexible sick leave policies, to allow employees to stay at home, and to allow employees to take care of the family.
According to OSHA, medium exposure jobs include those that require frequent or close contact, within six feet (1.8 m), of people without suspected or known COVID-19, but who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the company headquarters or because the person recently made an international trip to an area with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This includes workers in contact with the general public such as VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs, VOCs.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use breathing masks.
If a person becomes ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the patient from others by a distance of 6 feet, designating a crew member to care for the patient and offering a protective mask to the patient, or asking the patient to cover his or her mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when caring for an ill passenger or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the ill passenger has fever, persistent cough or breathing difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items must be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected thereafter.For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls include postponement of travel in the event of illness as well as self-isolation and immediate information from the on-board medical centre if a fever or other symptoms are developed once on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the isolated person's cabin; for schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection purposes if an infected person has been to a school building, regardless of community spread.
In case of minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling educational outings, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals at the canteen, increasing the space between offices, staggering arrival and exit times, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate infirmary for children with flu-like symptoms.
In case of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to strategies of social distancing, an extension of school holidays may be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must come into contact with people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as paramedics, including wearing adequate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during an arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belts before re-use with a wipe or household detergent spray and follow standard procedures for containment and disposal of used PPE as well as containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers some health and funeral workers to be in high or very high risk categories of exposure.
High-risk jobs include healthcare delivery, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they perform procedures producing aerosols or taking or handling samples of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sample collection.
High-risk funeral jobs include workers involved in the preparation of the bodies of people with suspected or known COVID-19 at the time of their death; they move to a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy.Additional technical controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known COVID-19, including when performing procedures that produce aerosols.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health and funeral settings.
Samples must be handled using level 3 biosafety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms based on suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends breathing masks for those working within 6 feet of patients with a suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved or higher N95 filtration respirators must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes adaptation, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and comfort for the worker. The WHO does not recommend combinations, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by body fluids.
The WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask only by screening personnel at the point of entry.
For those collecting respiratory samples, handling or transporting COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles or face shield, gown and gloves.
In the case of aerosol-producing procedures, the surgical mask is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.
Since the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a room occupied by a COVID-19 patient to those directly involved in his care, using the PPE necessary for the specific task only, continuing use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for multiple management.

This month we are in an exceptional situation.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the kind of empathy, cooperation and community building at the global level that is at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and benevolence we have observed among all of our colleagues in emails, calls and instant conversations are a remarkable testament to the incredible human beings we are fortunate enough to work with.
I couldn’t be more grateful and proud to have you all among my colleagues.
Last week, someone thanked me for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at this time, and the strong symbol that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make substantial adjustments to the way we work together starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned above, the C-Team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule in the days and months ahead.
During that conversation, we considered what we felt would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that time.
Above all, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to step back, don’t worry.
To all staff, contractors and contractors:
Our daily working time goal will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We do not declare a public holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you may be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, go shopping or see a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We do not monitor your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should go without saying, but we say it.
No sick leave or paid leave required: simply notify your supervisor and help your team review schedules and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please notify Bryan of T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can help you and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention from management).
The hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to honouring our responsibilities to our contractors and fellow hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal conditions.
This applies if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to relieve stress from the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to contact your supervisor, so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Security and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing essential work that may need reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess current objectives and focus on supporting core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for all of us, we will just focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won’t hurt later.
We do not intend to "work twice as hard to make up for lost time" when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to work overtime to meet now unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and will strive to establish new goals and timelines as appropriate.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and daily working time targets, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to set a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, taking care of themselves and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their work schedule reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will inform delegates and teams of the next steps upon confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Office location, exhibition and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of extreme caution, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol that uses products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork location, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff based in Washington DC.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a fully remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco’s guidance.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we have also debated the idea of renting a space in Brooklyn.
These discussions are continuing but could be adjourned.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues used to working remotely are aware that adaptation can be difficult and wanted to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings to sessions of one or two hours maximum.
If longer sessions are needed, consider spreading them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Make videos the norm, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live chat.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and speaker list, and someone who helps take notes (or make a group note).
Send an email to tech support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your wellness refund for snacks.
Connect with your colleagues on the Slack channel to talk to them about the distribution of work
The HR Operations team is studying webinar-based ergonomic guidelines to support the increased distribution of work within the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edit-a-thons, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We have explained to them that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions may make it impossible for them to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one will be penalized for any delay or change in these objectives.
Next week we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sad in the face of upheaval and relief in the face of clarity and the possibility of focusing on one’s own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for the sequel, the CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki in order to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Stay in touch despite COVID-19 issues
We will send an invitation on your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take this time to share further updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
Until then, you can always find the information contained in this email, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The TRC will update these pages and gather all the information in one place.
We also strive to maintain regular communication with staff residing in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, a significant workflow or coverage difficulties, or need help with anything else, feel free to notify and work with the CRT.
We are here to support you and provide liaison if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive questions, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of Global Global HR Operations.
None of these changes should be considered as an abandonment of our work and obligations.
On the contrary, it is a recognition that at this time our work and our obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps we feel are necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to give our movement the help it needs, and to offer the world the service that everyone can count on.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to help each other and prepare for the important work that will come in the weeks and perhaps months to come.
We need each one of you to do this, so you need to preserve yourself and take care of your families so that you can give your best when the time comes.
Please wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin-2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme linked to the outer face (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7) making it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular disease and is also the entry point into the cells of some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal renal amino acid transporter collectrine domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane type I protein, whose enzymatically active domain is exposed on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is connected to the cell membrane mainly cells of the pulmonary alveoli type II, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate for ACE.
ACE cleaves the hormone angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn cleaves the carboxyl-terminated amino acid phenylamine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis to angiotensin vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also cleave several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point into the cells of some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spicule S1 protein to the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and enzyme into the endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires initiation of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, inhibition of the latter is currently being investigated as a potential treatment, leading some to believe that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard treatment with ACE inhibitor and ARB.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that “the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects.”
In addition, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with the ACE inhibitor who were at higher risk of pneumonia, particularly victims of stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less conclusive than for the overall risk of pneumonia.”
The recombinant human angiotensin-2 converting enzyme (rhaCE2) is considered an innovative treatment for severe lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhaCE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the time to action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people who are intolerant to conventional renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS) or for diseases with high angiotensin II circulation. rhACE2 on infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate contact tracing in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of people (“contacts”) who may have come into contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the government in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracing applications.
These systems, especially those based on tracking the geographic location of app users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including using Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a feature to support these Bluetooth apps.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has rolled out an app in China that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, while Singapore has opted for an app called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local community of computer scientists, it has been provided as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched StopKorona!, a Bluetooth application that tracks exposure to potentially infected people and communicates quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracing application was at an advanced stage of development and could be rolled out in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are planning to implement applications based on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geo-referencing application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and residing in Moscow, to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of safety engineering at the University of Cambridge, discussed several possible practical problems with using application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if only a small portion of the population uses the app.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful “coronavirus” apps, Apple only allows “official” or generally trustworthy organizations to add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have raised concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is far away.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the restriction of such surveillance.
These organizations have stipulated eight conditions to be met in the context of government projects:
surveillance should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
extensions of monitoring and surveillance should include sunset clauses;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19 control objectives;
data security and anonymity should be demonstrably protected;
digital surveillance should ensure that discrimination and marginalization are not exacerbated;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in law;
There should be protections against abuse and remedies for citizens in the event of abuse;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to tackle the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism of the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracing has been approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems based on central servers need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, which allows privacy to be respected (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used for contact tracing.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking and card transaction data, which they then combined to send SMS warnings to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information publicly available, which was allowed following sweeping changes to privacy laws in the wake of the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is publicly available through several applications and websites, and countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized privacy-preserving systems.
Details had not yet been released on April 6, 2020.
Privacy-friendly contact tracing is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data as early as 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly known as Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Mobile Protocols and Mechanisms.
These protocols ensure that personally identifiable data never leaves the device and that all mapping is done on the device.
The MIT Media Lab’s Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or contact data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the white paper “Gone Rogue Apps: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technologies originally founded at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, a key factor in their adoption by a broad audience.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced the release of the BlueTrace protocol source code used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative, saying it would preserve privacy and combine Bluetooth Low Energy technology with privacy-enhancing cryptography.
They also released the specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
Deployment of tools to enable governments to create official, privacy-sensitive coronavirus tracking applications
Google and Apple plan to address the issues of solution adoption and persistent monitoring by initially distributing the system through operating system updates and later removing it in the same way once the threat is removed.
Repositioning a drug (also called reorientation, reprofiling, reassignment, or change of therapeutic indication of a drug) refers to the reconversion of a drug approved for a disease or medical condition different from that for which it was originally developed.
This is an area of scientific research currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transfusion from convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites offers the realistic project of developing an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-type protease, RNA-dependent polymerase RNA, helicase, S-protein, and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity to the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be part of the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is only authorized under the EUA as an investigational treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors said they use the drug "when there is no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Larger studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed that favipiravir is “clearly effective.”
35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative in an average of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and the other half received Umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence in favour of the drug is thin and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug in Japan for its reserves and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up possibilities for the Trump administration to acquire the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to procreate.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed."
These drugs have been designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would bind with the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There is criticism in the scientific community about the use of resources for the repositioning of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO has included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections, and then Gilead Sciences discovered that the remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against several filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies before the trial suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one involving people with moderate pathology and the other those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two controlled against placebo (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began testing the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial of the alvesco (ciclesonide) of Teijin, an inhalation corticosteroid used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
One form of angiotensin-2 converting enzyme, a phase II trial is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from among the severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing lung inflammation and complications in patients with moderate symptoms of COVID-19.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to issue guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients studying the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic assays was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, many researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for earlier outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Trials are also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab-COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, many development attempts are underway.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, for at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were undergoing Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak has broken out around the world in 2020, leading to significant investment and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Defined in April, the imperatives of CEPI’s vaccine development initiative are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 with the aim of creating an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Primary platform targets in Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5)
As CEPI scientists stated in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (allegedly under planning or design).
A Phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, controlled against placebo and performed in multiple centers while determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the vaccine’s effectiveness in preventing disease, while monitoring adverse reactions at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccine candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human evaluation phase (still in “preclinical” research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the University of Saskatchewan’s International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) announced that it has begun work on a vaccine, which is expected to begin human testing in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had begun work on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is developing an oral vaccine in collaboration with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that of neoantigen vaccination used for cancer treatment.
On March 25, the director of the research institute announced that they had finalized the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting tests.
On February 27, 2020, a Generex subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it had started a vaccine project to create an Ii-Key peptide-based vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans “within 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both located in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
On or about March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced its partnership with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced preclinical testing projects and a Phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even under the accelerated procedure, it would take about a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported developing a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is currently undergoing laboratory research, with human testing scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “large sums of money to benefit from exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine,” prompting the German government’s protest.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of a mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162 is currently in preclinical testing with the start of clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the human test of its final vaccine candidate could begin in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a consortium to research a COVID-19 vaccine including the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI’s total investment in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of the sequence being sent by China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine with plans to create a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, claiming that “microneedle-administered subunits of SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines triggered a significant response of antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization.”
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, combined with cloud-hosted computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia plans to include 4,170 health professionals.
Vaccines under development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of a vaccine using animal models specific to COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures for handling live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested in non-human animal models.
In 2020, there are no curative or protective SARS vaccines that have demonstrated both safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.
When MERS spread, it was thought that existing SARS research could serve as a model for developing vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three more were in progress; all vaccines were viral, two adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts released a conspiracy theory that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as the SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of taste, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range between two and fourteen days.
While the majority of cases cause moderate symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly during proximity contact, often by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
As these droplets are produced upon exhalation, they usually fall to the ground or to surfaces rather than pose an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and during later stages of the disease.The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for wearing masks by the general public vary, with some authorities advising against their use, others recommending their use, and still others requiring their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and a blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat can be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying proportions.
Some cases in China initially showed only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some, the disease can cause pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can be up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary evidence suggests that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and under study.The Korean Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
China’s National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; out of 166 infections seen so far, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Speaking loudly releases more droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without protection can throw droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually carried by air, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and that air collectors positioned in the hallway outside the patients' rooms produced positive samples of viral RNA.
Certain medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can disperse respiratory secretions and thus cause aerial propagation.
Although there are concerns about spread through stool, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spread may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not yet clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives for hours or even days on surfaces.
Precisely, the virus could be detected after one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and after four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, which disables and removes it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective; in a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to the Wuhan acute respiratory disease case outbreak.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. The SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is most abundant in the lung’s type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called a "spicule" (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage has been reported in 12% of people admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more common when the disease is more severe.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be linked to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and in the cardiac functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) has been observed in intensive care unit patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Autopsies of COVID-19 deaths have shown diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 exhibits tropism for respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF secretory T cells have been associated with recruitment of IL6-secreting inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported at autopsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, a nasal or sputum sample may also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours, or even up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, however they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and released the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world were able to independently develop chain polymerization reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (likely to detect active infections and a person’s previous infection) were being developed, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experiment of the test revealed an accuracy of only 60-70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first closest-to-patient test on March 21, 2020, to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobar bilateral frosted glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the onset of infection.
Dominance under pleural, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear with the progression of the disease.
Little data are available on microscopic lesions and on the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings at the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
Moderate pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytic hyperplasia, extensive atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia in Healing: Organizing Exudates in the Cell Cavities and Interstitial Pulmonary Fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (CIVD); leuco-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded areas, washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended covering the face with tissue in public places, to limit transmission in case of asymptomatic individuals.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected individuals with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing travel, and cancelling large groupings of people.
The distancing guidelines also include respecting a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
There is no drug known to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, a key element of COVID-19 management is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after coughing, coughing, or sneezing.
It also recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not available, WHO offers two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol, it is "not an antiseptic active substance for the hands".
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
People are treated with supportive care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy, and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analyzed.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Supportive treatments may be helpful in those with moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection.The WHO and China's National Health Commission have published recommendations for inpatient care for COVID-19.
Resuscitators and pulmonologists in the United States have gathered therapeutic recommendations from several agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
When it comes to symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen in the first line.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially under care conditions where carrying out procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health care professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an airborne infection-adapted isolation chamber (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne transmission precautions.The CDC points out guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE coat, face or respiratory mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, preference is given to respiratory masks (to face masks).
N95 breathing masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face protection screens, or as a last resort, handcrafted masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied for hospitalized individuals.There is some evidence that intubation can be prevented by using a high-throughput nasal cannula or positive double-level airway pressure.
It is not known whether either or both of these have the same benefits for people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high-throughput nasal cannula. Severe cases are more common in older adults (those over 60, and especially those over 80).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the healthcare system to deal with a sudden spike in COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% required respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices with pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of lung injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are undergoing clinical trials.
The remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several drugs being tested are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
Antiviral medication can be tried in people with severe illness.
The WHO has recommended that volunteers participate in trials on the efficacy and safety of potential treatments, and the FDA has granted temporary authorization to plasma from convalescent people as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The app is able to detect “close contacts” using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities.Big data analytics of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people they have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate the mobile phone data of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
The measure was aimed at enforcing quarantine and protecting people who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to analyze and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect non-quarantine people.
In Italy, regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he had been informed by mobile phone operators that “40 percent of people continue to move.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global call for creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease can have a moderate course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common diseases of the respiratory tract such as the common cold.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, however, data for COVID-19 are lacking.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-visceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, bleeding disorders, and heart, kidney, and liver damage.
Coagulation disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of COVID-19 hospitalized cases, with renal impairment observed in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time from symptom onset to death was 10 days, including five days spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average length of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the average time from symptom onset to death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), men had a 2.8% mortality rate while women had a 1.7% mortality rate.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cellular exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image resembles acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest was observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalized had pre-existing conditions, and the availability of medical resources and socioeconomic conditions in a region can also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Undercounting of moderate cases may lead to overvaluation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and were 2.4 times more likely to go to intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
Hong Kong hospital administration has observed a 20% to 30% drop in respiratory capacity in some people cured of the disease, and lung scans suggest organ damage.
This can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was not known whether a previous infection had effective long-term immunity in people cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered likely, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases of people cured of COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered a worsening of a latent infection rather than a reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by spreading the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost solely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet found that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, health system quality, treatment options, time since the outbreak began, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the ICD-10 U07.1 emergency disease codes for laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 cases without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.9 percent (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed with the disease who die, and the infectious lethality rate (IRF), which reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosed or not) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease has spread through festivals, and to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate, and not all COVID-19-related deaths may have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German healthcare system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people may have antibodies, according to a blood donor assessment.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed to be related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in humans in studies in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among men in their fifties, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at age 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The precise reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioral factors may be part of it.
Immunological differences by sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and the development in men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a lower age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government is not collecting data associated with the gender of COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nurses, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the outbreak: December 31, 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in line with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in its public communication.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as “coronavirus.”
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended using the 2019-nCov provisional disease and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease names for the virus and disease, in line with the 2015 guideline against the use of places in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity limitations of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed a respirator valve urgently and the supplier could not supply it in a timely manner, a local startup retro-designed and printed out the required 100 valves in one night.
After the initial COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, fake news and misinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to some other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the SOLIDARITY trial to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE 2 receptor to penetrate human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being researched.
First, the researchers are trying to create a whole-virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to provoke a rapid immune response from the human body in the event of a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spicule S protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE 2 receptor.
A third strategy is that of vaccines based on nucleic acids (vaccination by DNA or RNA, a new technique for creating vaccination).
On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluated previously approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconverted antiviral drugs make up the majority of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials on remdesivir in several countries expected to be reported at the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of vaccine candidates and COVID-19 drugs was also in place as of April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta-associated lopinavir/ritonavir.
Preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some require an independent analysis of the research.
Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that twice that dose is highly dangerous and could be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorization at the discretion of doctors caring for COVID-19 patients.The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for continuation of an in vivo study after demonstrating low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have demonstrated that the initial spicule protein initiating with transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE 2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine shock can be a complication at later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine anti-shock properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
It is currently in a non-randomized phase 2 trial nationwide in Italy after showing positive results in people with a severe form of the disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine shock, it must counter such developments that are suspected to be causing the deaths of some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cells treatment, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems of people who have cured COVID-19 to people who need it is being investigated as a non-vaccination method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action by which passive antibody-based treatment can generate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, such as using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The serum production of convalescent people, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of cured patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
