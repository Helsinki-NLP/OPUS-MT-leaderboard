Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be presented to him, among other things, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and will have a busy program.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple’s schedule then includes an interview with Norway’s King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will peak in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the award, but only the third to receive the award within the Committee's own walls.
The White House has informed in advance that Obama will speak about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this subject because he is aware that he receives this award by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at the moment.
He stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for ten million Swedish kroner (about 1.1 million euros).
He intends to donate it to charities, but he has not yet concretely decided which ones.
His busy schedule will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant to this price in the beginning.
He said, for example, that he felt he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that this is not a prize for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as the announcement was made, he said it would be an "invitation to act".
A defender of nature accused of blackmail
The Litomice police have charged the president of the Association of Nature Protectors of Litomice with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction site procedures and asked for money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for withdrawing his appeal, said Alena Romova, spokesman for the Litomice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litomic is Lubomir Studniska.
He is currently in detention and faces up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting bins are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packaging, while in the villages of South Moravia you come across sorting trucks at every corner.
What about Brno?
There, you would have to take several minutes before finding the right tippers.
I don't mean we wouldn't sort the waste at all in Brno.
But I have the impression that the city councillors in our city, the second largest city in the country, are not paying enough attention to this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially given the number of dumpsters dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is a whole science, which requires above all time and nerves of steel.
The only place I have found at the moment is the Moravian square in front of Potrefena Husa.
Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't blame me, but I don't think so.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it’s not a sinecure either.
Finally, many of my friends do not sort their waste.
Out of laziness.
It's a trick for them to get to the dumpsters.
I'm not surprised about them.
Myself, after a party, I offered to go and throw a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except that I did not see any colored dumpster on Kounicova street.
Fortunately, I found the right place to take the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
It is after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city best, right?!
It is probably that ecology and so-called aestheticism are not of much interest to the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city a spot in the top hockey league that shames the city all over the country, instead of buying a few extra skips and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad I was able to confirm my impression with official statistics after hanging out for a while on the internet.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole South Moravian region.
Paroubek's budget has taken away money for pensions and sick leave
After the left has grown, despite the advice of the government, farmers or civil servants it may be that there is a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on state debt or international court proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase for some classes, they relied on the fact that the government would make loans for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting off the problems, undermining the ground," Janota said.
It should be known that on the borrowed money the interest to be paid is increasingly high and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state does not really have a choice as to where to draw money.
If he doesn't cut welfare or spending, he'll have to raise taxes.
To all those whom the left has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater debt of the State - next year it will not miss 163 billion in the coffers, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and faster, and with it, interest-related expenses.
The state will need money to pay it back and it will no longer be enough to increase VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Five billion will also be needed to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly sections already decided and started whose projects cannot be modified to possibly reduce costs.
At the very least keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping 30 major projects, and the withdrawal of European funds is also in danger, according to Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The SSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very adroitly - it will draw on the dividends of the SEZ (supplier and distributor of electrical energy), which the State for the most part owns and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is by no means a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from the EEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement the pension accounts or are they used as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit by 5.7 percent of GNP according to EU rules.
And this is far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations to the victims of communism and crimes, and even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay for it anyway, Janota says.
The minister will then have to save on the department’s side or, in the worst case, touch on the government’s budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing from the $2 billion state fund project, which is intended to track the expenses of each administration online.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister could not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be halted and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed look promising.
All it takes is a button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them into personal and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and it was made a first demonstration a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is not fiction at all.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, of a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. carriers to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to devices sometime in 2012.
The shortage of snow in the mountains bothers hoteliers
Deserted runways are not a problem only for ski lift operators.
The lack of snow deters people from booking their ski holidays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have many visits to our site.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking at the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas,” said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info news portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in , it is better not to hesitate to book.
If we give priority to savings and the quality of the accommodation comes only afterwards, then we can try to wait a few more days.
At the moment, hoteliers in -pindler only offer one-week stays for the New Year.
I think they will try for a moment to place them, but they will give up too and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura estimated.
The tourism agency Ingtours du Vrchlab also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We are most interested in Christmas at the moment, it is not completely sold out.
There are still, say, half the rooms in our offer.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The tourist agency of the Vrchlaba can also offer the New Year in Krkonoe, but there are fewer places available.
The first fourteen days of February leave just as well, the remaining winter stays sell out on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoe.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas too will be complete,” thinks Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupancy of the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Snakou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We still have some last places for New Year as for Christmas.
There is great interest during the January holidays of the Poles and February sells well too," informs Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the central car park of J?nské L?zn? is also 80 percent complete during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in J?nské L?zn?.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupancy at present.
February is a little bit weaker for now but as soon as the snow falls, interest in stays in the Krkonoe will certainly grow again, said the director of the Omnia hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, hoteliers in the Krkonoe should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be cooler and if there is precipitation, it should be snowy in the mountains.
But then, the weather should warm up, informs Ji? Jakubsk? from the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It even becomes comic, the assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, president with the reputation of wise, reproduces the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, which he himself considered very simple.
When he ended up letting his long-awaited doctrine sweat through, it turned out that he had copied it on carbon paper since Bush’s Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending new reinforcements into an Iraq consumed by civil war as being “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only one possible and likely to be so successful that the newspapers at present do not speak at all of Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, however, objectively speaking, he left his successor with a much more favourable final situation than could have been expected.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It was once again the campaign commanders who asked him to increase the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House’s reluctance despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, he at least defrauded the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to pull out the promise of 5,000 more from Europe, even though he originally counted 10,000.
What is causing the most problems in Obama's entire strategy appears to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and complete the whole process within three years.
Many doubt that an increase of half will bring the same fruits as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out by the exact opposite - no one can be counted on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leaders on a day-to-day basis according to what suits them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain nothing but dust in the eyes behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is singularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity as to the relationship, which is further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "prompt-to-act state", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy is perplexed by his voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and it is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a heart that is purely romantic and out of reality can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their "prompt return home" will bring a real miracle.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will consider it as the indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is turning negative.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the enhanced sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the Americans will find themselves faced with the very difficult question of resolving the problem through the use of military force.
It will have to be answered, for example, when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only rustine for Obama is the fact that he has three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for him to work on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced it in response to strong criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell for five years.
Shares can be withdrawn from leaders in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of the effort to link rewards with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I guess Wall Street is well aware of the global meaning that needs to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The concern lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the onset of the financial crisis, high premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it would allocate a single tax of fifty percent on bankers’ bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics.
Five women, a record number, received today in Stockholm from the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prizes in technical disciplines and literature.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the Romanian-born German writer Herta Muller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath along with American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes.
The latest winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that has not had a winner this year has been physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of fiber optics and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, fax or astronomical glasses.
Each laureate received the diploma, Nobel medal and certificate of acquisition of the pecuniary award.
This amounts to ten million Swedish kroner in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward with each other.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
The latter, in his speech, recognized the controversial nature of his award since he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To the discharge of his policy he added that in certain situations war is indispensable to obtain peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Vaclav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is weighing his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as it was voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that Janota's budget and perhaps also his position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their meeting on Friday.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed of the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted to Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic is expected to run a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday validated the proposals of the left on money transfers and increased the remuneration of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of the Social Democrats for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement was born between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, a disagreement that calls into question the future of Fischer's cabinet which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the SSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as voted by MPs, removes the package of savings measures passed by the Fischer government and which must curb the debt of the state.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but is not obliged to do so, said today at a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irreprehensible deficiency" of public finances.
Now, according to him, there is no favorable solution.
Only a strong government could bring about an improvement, if it could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolnek said the budget is staggering and that the government should question its future existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nesas told the TK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the SSD, the ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words “drastic verdicts.”
The head of the SSD, Jiz Parubek, reacted to Topolnek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolnek is staggering and that it will exceed 200 billion kroner.
Already on Wednesday, the SSD called the ratification of the state budget for the next year a success.
The People’s Party was also pleased.
Morgan Freeman to Play Mandela in Clint Eastwood’s New Movie
Despite criticism that the lead roles are being played by American actors, South Africans say the new Hollywood film Invictus – Undefeated will expose the world to a lot about the country, its fights and victories.
The story is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman stars as the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was a ninety-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I'm going to play you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who won an award for his role in Clint Eastwood’s boxing drama Milion Dollar Baby has, for example, played the leader of a movement against slavery that has become a slave, a fictional US president, or even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone who is still alive and as important to so many as Mandela.
The former South African statesman has been jailed for 27 years for his hard work in ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela and South African rugby team captain François’ joint efforts to unify the country, and newly elected President Mandela knows that his country remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among the underdogs in the world.
The South African team eventually progressed to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela’s story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play that role in a way that brought it closer to reality,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dine with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I felt like I knew how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon stars in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he has six months to prepare for a role in rugby’s tough middle.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I rang the doorbell, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, ‘I look a lot bigger in the movie.’
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the direction of director Eastwood received positive reviews and we even talk about ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety summed up his appreciation in these words: “It’s a very good story, a very well made movie.”
In the film ratings on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin has been observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only acknowledged yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian borders.
The launch, however, was again a failure and the “Bulava”-type missile that was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the tests of the rocket did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava did not fly, or it damaged in mid-flight.
Russian Newspapers Call ‘Bulava’ ‘Missile That Won’t Fly’
A missile that does not fly but shines
This 13th test was carried out at the beginning normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the aircraft.
It was obviously the engine on the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a moving and submerged craft.
This is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was likely caused by a faulty "Bulava".
The Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time we can't talk absolutely about failure.
The first two stages of the rocket resisted and the damage only touched the third.
In previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first stage.
Even though none of the test launches went smoothly, the Ministry of Defence management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent fills the generals with optimism and they always say that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will carry away even ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at age 51
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will appear again in a professional match at age 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend a hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his debut already in Friday’s match against Petrograd.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After the injury of Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details on the form, says the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been clarified whether the legendary hockey player’s comeback will involve only one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Fetisov quintet, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he won twice gold at the Olympic Games, seven world championship titles, he triumphed at the Canada Cup as well as at the world junior championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in the NHL where twice he held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai listens to unions and cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in Nosovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
Spokesman Petr Vanok of the Hyundai plant confirmed this.
However, the management wants to agree again with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We can not give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why volunteer overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19 knowing that there would be two teams, said Vanak.
The company's website Sedmika.cz said the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech kroner to employees who would be part of Saturday's team.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Vanak, has decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can apply for a replacement holiday on December 28 and thus extend their holiday season.
In addition to this, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
Given the fact that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and demands of unions as employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vanak said.
Until last week, workers at the car factory were forced to work almost two hours extra per day in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the car factory and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchai said on Wednesday they were ready to stop the strike if they agreed on their demands and signed a joint document.
The situation at the plant peaked last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to unrelenting overtime.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and alleged hazing.
The management defended itself with the fact that the employees had to work extra to fulfill the imperatives in the production of automobiles.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the unions also demanded that workers who have stopped production not be subject to any sanctions.
The unions are asking the company to keep overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a reward of 5,000 kroner (about 209) for these.
The Hyundai car factory in Nosovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started mass production last year in November.
It has manufactured about 80,000 vehicles by September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on “endurant” HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality takes precedence, in some cases, over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on common variants of the virus as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at this time.
However, the lives of patients can be radically prolonged through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption leads to a series of side effects.
In addition, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of the development of so-called resistant viruses on which the drugs no longer have any effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VCHT in Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers’ work leads them to discover new “enhanced” substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their binding to the virus’s proteins.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease there would be no mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, the researchers say in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in test tubes as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the common version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarborans is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however it does not weaken on resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarborans, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore interesting combinations to examine further in order to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlana ezova, director of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Institute of Molecular Genetics.
Fights over budget. The ODS attacks Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolinek, called the ratified budget for the following year “scaring” and said that the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The prime minister called the ODS’s remarks a drastic verdict.
He says he takes time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Nesas said that the idea of an administrative cabinet backed by the SSD, the ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nesas, the head of government should decide whether to support the minority in the Chamber of Deputies who are concerned about fighting the growing deficit, or whether to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nesas warned that the positions of the ODS and the social democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday ratified the budget for the year 2010, but with the proposed changes to the amount of 12 billion kroner included by the left.
The House increased the money for civil servants' salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government’s grievance with the Social Democrats’ proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that an amended budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and Uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will still think about the current situation.
Nesas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office if the proposed amendments were to be ratified, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment Monday with the prime minister after his time in government:
At the same time, he said he was wondering if he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the budget negotiations is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nesas believes that the representatives of the SSD, who imposed the changes in the budget, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other deficit-enhancing legislation such as health insurance, pensions, or reform of the Services Act.
Topolnek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not at issue.
This is the business of the head of government Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the SDO have done nothing harmful, Topolinek said in a text-based statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries claim TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nesas pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of waging a struggle against the amount of the deficit of public finances, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the Democrats’ support and tolerance.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda then I will devote myself to it, said from the House to journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Bartok, elected to the government precisely by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew off in the afternoon for a European Council debate in Brussels.
The SDO backtracked at the request of the Prime Minister.
At the same time, Nesas pointed out that the ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked the Democratic MPs to allow the budget to be voted on.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not been reproached by the party president in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have been absent.
I already knew by the time I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolshevism of the House and a destruction of all that was positive, Topolnek reacted in person.
According to the new timetables of the "D" there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit some less loaded express or regional trains from 13 December and will instead reinforce some others.
Total transport coverage will fall on the day of entry into force of the new timetables by two percent compared to today.
Most pricing will not change, including base rates and the reduced rate.
It is for example the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a Pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer high-speed trains on the Prague - Pesek - Budjovice line, the direct Prague - Letohrad line will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport is in the Hradec Kr?lové region by a total of eight percent, but Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague-Tubor-Seké Budojovice line are also cancelled and the circulation of a few express trains on the Prague-Posek-Seké Budojovice line will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the greatest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lys nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko commuter system, which can be opened thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysi nad Labem and Milovice.
The remote lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague’s main railway station (Praha Hlavna ndraa).
The D will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava, and trains bound for the Dumperk/Jesenak will depart in two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The bill this year for regional railways: 200 million crowns extra.
The express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the railways next year a total of 4 billion crowns to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions which will pay for them by a total of 8 billion next year, knowing that the state will participate to the tune of almost 3 billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have recently signed a ten-year contract, so far the duration was always one year.
Railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they have not resorted to an increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will only affect the one-day tickets and discounted internet tickets.
For travelers without a discount card, the price of Net D will increase from 450 to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiska will depend on the route travelled, whereas until then it was valid between cities in a region of your choice and was at a single price of 160 kroner.
Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, children released
The rebels have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP news agency that reported the incident, but who originally spoke of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, along with one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields during an escape from police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP news agency, the police first prosecuted the kidnappers following violence caused by a settling of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law has been declared in the southern Philippine province of Maguindanao because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the elections of the governor's administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippine province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as was his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
South Africa’s history is about everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in American theaters in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora?en?), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous apartheid fighter went to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody it.
The men’s supporting role of the legendary South African rugby champion has been awarded to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, the feedback of critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of thought, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
He served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film holds great hopes, as it is being presented at a time when South Africa is in the midst of preparations for the football World Cup, and because the media is troubled by worrying news of increasing racial conflict and discrimination by the ruling black majority.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations expressed towards the main roles where "pavant" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless, in his own words, proud of the film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and I have prepared myself well.
I have also met Nelson Mandela many times personally to be able to - as they say - recover his energy, he said at the official premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it’s a good thing if you can remember Mandela’s personality and message through the film.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual.
Women's national rugby team jerseys
The film based on the story of the novel by the British writer John Carlin, the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave its creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his tenure as president.
Morgan Freeman tried to reattach two racial groups from a long-divided population, and just as Nelson Mandela in 1995 entered the South African team's national jersey on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won at the time.
For showing up on the lawn in a jersey, which is considered in South Africa to be something sacred, Mandela had been given a long standing ovation fourteen years ago mostly from the white public and was recognized by the white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in uniting people once again into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only "black" national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
South African whites are skeptical, however, as recently told in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire engulfed in the morning a transformer of the company of the center of distribution near the commune of Vakov na Lounsku.
According to Luko Marvan, spokesman for the fire department of osto, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer burn, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical fault, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the spokesman of the company Pavla Mandatova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission set.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
The destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
She adds that in ten years of activity, the company has not experienced anything similar and that incidents of this type are isolated.
Electricity supplies have not been interrupted, says the spokesperson of the company for the North Bohemian company Soza Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Oeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech Republic of transmission assemblies and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transmission sets to distribution sets and line layouts with a length of 4,339 kilometers.
Januarya will file a defamation complaint against three prefects of the SSD
Student Agency owner Radim Janaura will file a defamation complaint today against three Democratic Social Prefects.
And specifically against Michal Ha'ek of the South Moravian region, against Radko Martanka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesa'k.
This was stated by Janaura in Radiosurnul's Dvacet minut.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and say that we make the fine mouths, when we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
All we have to do is defend ourselves.
It's in exchange for the slanders about the Student Agency company, said Januura to Radionurnul.
He also said he had evidence that no region had acted in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
He considers that the complaint filed by Mr. Janaura represents the continuation of his media show, which serves as a free advertisement for his company and for his person.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr. Janura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and misleading arguments about regional rail transport, says Hasek.
Janura has already informed last week that it will invest a few million kroner in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiournul that he will interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he intends to resume it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption in the broadest sense.
The campaign began after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of the railway links for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing a call for tenders.
According to Janura, such a course of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to threats from a member of the SSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He ran as a member of the SSD, I don't know who he is, but I won't say his name," Januura told Radiournul today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices that say mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay for vaccines.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
Another vaccination.
Free vaccines for August children.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal diseases.
The condition is that they have not been vaccinated yet.
If you started the vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
Yet parents paid 1600 kroner or more for a dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that every year health insurance companies spend 300 to 450,000 kroner in vaccine doses.
They do, however, save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 crowns a year on all vaccinations for children.
The reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcus is the cause of inflammations of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammations of the meninges and blood poisonings.
According to hospital investigations, there are up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions regarding a possible obligation to vaccinate in the future.
From January, it must be paid by insurance and optional.
For example, Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsko, president of the association, said that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcal diseases.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we were able to impose at least this.
I think this is a direction that must now be followed,” Kalovsko said.
But the health ministry does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are not considering it at all at the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochov, president of the Specialized Society of Pediatricians, acknowledges that a voluntary vaccination will have its flaws.
If all children were vaccinated, we could consider a reduction in the renewals of vaccinations "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making the vaccination optional," says however Cabrnochova.
Experts predict that as early as next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease also marks a break in the fact that it is the first vaccination of children that is financed by insurance and not the State.
Cabrnochov explains that insurance should free up funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products.
This is, however, related to the concerns of pediatric practitioners, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
Some MPs feared, however, that this would allow insurance companies to "deduct the sums of health insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to reimburse them.
It is estimated that individual pediatricians will have to invest nearly 40,000 kroner per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochova.
The son of an American artist involved in a "museum robbery"
Frank Frazetta’s son, a well-known illustrator, has been accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Frazetta was arrested while loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the entrance to the museum, in the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) news agency reported.
AP quoted a police official as saying the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family feud.
According to a police statement, said Mr. Frazetta Jr., 52, claims to have been authorized by his father to “enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility,” the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denies giving such permission, the agency said.
Labour is pushing for an increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the tax increase and spending cuts announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling “missed” an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor has also drawn the wrath by tackling low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, we can see a 0.5% increase in Social Insurance and a 1% ceiling rate on public wages from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
Unions have protested that low wages are being penalized by a recession for which they are not responsible and have warned that “problems” are looming.
The reduction in Social Insurance - which will get around 3 billion GBP per year - has made the business world angry, because according to him, it is a tax on jobs when the goal should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than 20,000 GBP per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% Tax on Banker Bonuses
The increase in the corporation's corporate income tax for small corporations has been abandoned
Discounts on taxes for electric cars and wind turbines
Pensions increase by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and a person earning 40,000 GBP will lose 190 GBP, while a person earning 10,000 GBP per year will earn 110 GBP more.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 led to “difficult decisions” but insisted that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would weigh on the top 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, refuted an increase in the tax and pointed out that a decrease in spending was a "drop of water in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important and will allow us to halve the deficit, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that economic growth would resume at the end of the year.
However, Labour’s forecasts for economic growth – which will influence how much it will have to borrow and how quickly the deficit will be filled – have been questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his initial figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would likely fall by 4.75% this year – far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Missed Opportunity"
The Conservatives who will launch a new advertising campaign warning against the "debt crisis" of Labour, have claimed that the project to borrow 789 billion GBP over the next six years is not viable.
Ministers failed to come up with a credible plan on how to pay back, they added, “cynically” avoiding difficult choices until after the elections – to be held in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything meaningful about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Treasury Secretary of the Shadow Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
“Important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of who wins.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike Tory’s proposals that would result in a faster and larger reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised through higher taxes and lower spending would be used to support next year’s spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were “built on wind.”
Nick Robinson, the BBC’s political editor, said the timing of the announcements – such as rising inflation for some disability benefits next April, mentioned above – would leave the Chancellor facing propaganda charges, with the money simply being recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that more help is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False Budget"
Although ministers did not release spending details beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that government spending restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies has claimed that the Chancellor’s figures imply substantial reductions in many areas in the future, potentially including transportation, higher education, science and defense.
“The pain is actually only postponed,” said its Director, Robert Chote.
“The most important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of who wins,” said Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s financial advisor to accountants.
"This has been a false pre-budget report. Markets are well aware of it."
FBI Investigates ‘Arrests of Americans in Pakistan’
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether these were the same men who were reported missing from their homes in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information on these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are U.S. citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are being held,” said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing,” she said.
Pakistan’s embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house owned by one of their uncles.
She said the house was already being monitored by local police and that no charges had yet been laid against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, the Reuters news agency reported, but said the U.S. must “work more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students were reported missing from their homes by their families in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iran's "abuses"
Over the past two decades, human rights have been respected as little as ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
The report presents "repeats of violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
A man named in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticisms of its failure to respect human rights.
The authorities have claimed that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran, after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"Fake confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer science student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
“They often hit me in the face,” he was quoted as saying.
“I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, in my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.”
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still bleeding and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, losing candidate Mehdi Karroubi claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iranian authorities denied the rape charges, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he and 75 others had been locked in a container for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian parliament and judiciary would establish a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government’s response, but said the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks in an effort to prevent further protests.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn the Bristol site into a competition track.
Track in the Park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowborders to compete for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park Runway, a small springboard preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was beautiful but it was quite intimidating.
It is a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city shimmering below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowborders in the country – real talents,” he added.
Awards have been given to the best aerobatics - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be left to melt.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French do not like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and preoccupied the country for about fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious plot.
A good anthropologist, he doesn’t just want to know what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country right now.
He spent many months in the mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He knows very well how to listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab Muslim.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
The conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their purist Sunni Islamist counterparts associated with Saudi Arabia who today constitute a small part of Europe’s Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wonders how much French politicians (and the intellectual elite so virulent guardian of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrowness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it a life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In “On a Thin Layer of Ice,” writer and illustrator Richard Ellis paints a natural history of the Great North symbol, the polar bear.
Acquainted with the history and complicated policies of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved their worth hunting polar bears.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson, then a courageous 14-year-old aspirant who had to fight only the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, caught swimming alongside their recently killed mother, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show brought together 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still usually one millionth of the surface area needed by an adult at large; the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has turned green due to algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often discusses the threat hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians in motoski use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, “After the Ice,” Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating glimpse into what the future may be like there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphericists nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of change.
It's not for want of trying.
At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering voyages gave the first information on the melting of the ice cap.
Cold War submarines then mapped the relief changes below it.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice-dependent system, formed by brackish water nets pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.

Marines among 6,000 people who laid wreaths on graves in Arlington
The first class De'Angello Robinson, 19, made a seven-hour bus trip to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
“In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I would want someone to do the same for me, which is why I’m just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans, in different sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen travel each year, stopping in different cities on their way, to hold commemorations in honor of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the site of the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her late husband, a career military man.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and extensive hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose ancient tombs, dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Vietnam War, as these are not visited as often as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as the children were playing and the couples were holding hands, carrying the fresh pine wreaths over the gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red bow tie on the top.
Nearby was Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals wept without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names carved into the stone while others leaned over to see the little black and white information cards, sunk into the damp earth for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many tearful mothers at her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio and drove eight hours to collect at the grave of Marine Sergeant Gunnery David Shane Spicer, who died in action in July.
No one should ever forget that we are free... my son paid for it, she said.
“Long after I’m gone, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. citizen arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. citizen who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs officials said.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and World Bank.
Consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being “dangerous”.
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sanchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how she and her husband are being followed and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but permissions have always been denied.
The detention of a U.S. national may increase tensions between the brothers’ communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a “soft” approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the U.S. can reciprocate.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country where the average salary of an official is $15 a month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day's pay.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often must communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that would be allowed in any other open society -- free distribution of mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas Program Director at Human Rights Watch, which recently released a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his sick older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, put on trial and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when the two countries are beginning to start a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization believed to be plotting to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case would disassemble a large network of terrorist recruiters who are scavenging the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators claimed they were hunting down a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments endorsing the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt, home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of the CIA’s plot to infiltrate the terror network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the northeast that have become a haven of terrorism.
They were considered undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The official said the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary permits to gain entry into al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- insists on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. Secret Service has prioritized infiltrating men into the al-Qaeda network.
The organization’s recruiters play the role of gatekeepers, denying entry to those who don’t show serious commitment and those who may turn out to be spies.
Analysts say potential U.S. recruits are being closely studied by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to U.S. targets and their propagandistic value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups also need to pay more and more attention in recent years in choosing the people they accept because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model that so many other people have already followed?” said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is more and more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen call for climate action
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked the streets here on Saturday, demanding more climate action from negotiators working at the city’s Bella Convention Center.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On this day when little has happened during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched around the city, rolling out signs in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, saying 'Earth says it has had enough'.
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including top Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother’s homeland, Peru, has opened her eyes to the heartbreaking issues facing the country due to the impact of climate change already occurring.
That's one of the reasons I decided to join the big march -- to spread the word and appeal to leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions," she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in the climate talks, activists who wore masks and black clothes, lit several explosives near Copenhagen’s main canal which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were throwing them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "a few big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters failed to awaken the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, China’s climate representative.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, “Actually, it’s something I wasn’t aware of.
He then went on to Mandarin, saying, “The event being important, I can’t hear what’s going on outside.”
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful depending on the outlook.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or harm the freedom of others.”
Test results reveal persistent differences between breeds
Last week’s federal report on math scores brought good news for Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District is still far behind the top establishments, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are far more advanced in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between the performance of African-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of white Grade 4 (cm1) children in Washington D.C. have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but those of their African-American classmates have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in achievement actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling only by one point, from 245 to 244.
The mean white test result was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overview over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1) class, when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by the children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by school group director Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean we have elevated the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and inconvenient, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equality in education in the District.
I’m not jumping for one or two points,” said Kwame R. Brown, a D.C. board member whose daughter is in Grade 4 at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee’s management style, Brown said the message of the test results is that the city’s middle schools are in desperate need of attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what’s scary is that we don’t spend enough time and energy on our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to meet the needs of struggling students.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at schoolchildren at the end of elementary and beginning of middle school who have not integrated the basics of reading earlier in their school career and who are quite late compared to their peers.
Every day, the math program, for Kindergarten classes to Grade 6 (6th) focuses on games and real-life experiences, as they were set up in the District by former manager Clifford Janey, who also needs to be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to deliver better interventions to these lower-grade students,” Rhee said.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to elevate the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with poorer results in order to narrow the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher trainer at the University of Berkeley in California who studies city test scores.
The conventional policy solution is to dedicate your resources and management reforms to schools in Washington’s poorest neighborhoods.
Also, this targeting can have political repercussions that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other superintendents of schools, she’s trying to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We are focused on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they come from, are assured that their children will be able to get an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of the Newark schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the key elements to narrowing the gap in success was the length of traditional public school, now 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, that he is considering a "starting point" to get another raise in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise for the Future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, descends and blinks for a moment at the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents were only able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 students (4th) from the group explored Gettysburg where tuition is $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of an impressed new student than enthusiastic.
"That's where I'm going to study!" exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, as the guide directed them to the entrance to the science building.
Youpi, really? she said thoughtfully, when she was told the low ratio of law professor to student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children visited during their three-day discovery journey and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you are going to college:
The question is where.
While this question still largely arises for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents as teenagers, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one in five 'second generation' Hispanics continue their high school education -- a notable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most of them from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, and they are paving the way for future generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study flappers claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need to succeed.
Many parents also set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
“When you look at children from low-income families with parents who don’t have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, won’t help them,” said Patricia Gundara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Graciela University Visit is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize college readiness programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school and continue through the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been attended by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry gets deals with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its struggling infrastructure during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Oil Ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are poised to play a major role in restoring Iraq’s oil industry, which has been crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies returned with a stake in only two of the 10 fields being auctioned.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who had bid lost.
Two U.S. companies won contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in opening up the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an Internet news site.
It will be a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops pull back have held back U.S. oil companies, preventing them from entering more forcefully into Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest crude oil reserve, analysts say.
U.S. companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged by their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labor costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which had strong ties with and provided technical advice to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. bid more on contracts than other companies and returned with large stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological powerhouse, said oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on par with its competitors and fulfill its commitments in Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit bids made bids that were then compared to the price per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of al-Qaeda's top organisers reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that a U.S. missile struck along the border with Afghanistan killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda operations this week, U.S. counterintelligence officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles thrown into their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan’s anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a Pakistani civilian intelligence official said, speaking on Shah's phone.
Officials said suspected local activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the “totally shredded bodies.”
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identities of the victims, but the two US anti-terrorist representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of al-Qaida's military organizers who directed the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second U.S. official said Somali had made rapid progress in al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the American public at large, but it does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, the second official said.
If confirmed, Somali would be the second major al Qaeda figure or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operatives.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has declined since the summer, from about six operations a month to two, according to figures put forward by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to decrease their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site claims.
UN special envoy in Kabul withdraws
U.N. Special Envoy to Afghanistan Kai Eide said Friday that he will step down from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous term marred by allegations of widespread corruption during the U.N.-backed presidential elections.
Eide’s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the U.S. timetable for a troop withdrawal that would begin in 18 months and force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community,” Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but would simply abide by the pledge he made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was best to start looking for my replacement,” Eide said.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
Representatives say the name of Staffan di Mistura has been cited; he is an Italo-Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide’s reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him, in September, of favoring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the allegations, but said Galbraith's accusations -- which were dismissed -- "damaged the mission because there was already a fair amount of skepticism about international election observation."
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying it would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying the UN’s hefty hiring regulations are hampering his ability to bring in new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world’s major powers will soon impose “significant additional sanctions” on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of an audience of 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the possibility of such an outcome.
One of the things that weighs most on me is that if I’ve learned one thing in Iraq in the last six years, it’s the unpredictable side of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He said a "set of motivations and punishments" might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons because "its people would suffer enormously" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face “likely” consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its oversight body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experiment solely for peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva talks on October 1, he said he would resume dialogue on reducing his nuclear program and agreed to abandon a significant portion of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration pushed such an agreement, a way to build trust on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have moved away from attempts at agreement – in part, experts say, because Iran’s leadership is divided over whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, Iran’s stiffening in the face of some of the international community’s proposals for which they had actually agreed in early October, pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to come together on what they hadn’t envisioned, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set December 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turned to other options, including continuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “increased sanctions.”
In a statement Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "baseless allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution."
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington late Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the rich Kurdish oil region to meet with troop leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly over borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, chairman of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy in a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you.”
In an ageing China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters preaching to them, “Mother Earth is too tired to take in more children” and “An extra baby is an extra grave.”
They have learned the lesson so well that the Shanghai government authorities, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate in their city and the ageing population, have radically changed direction this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction has been instant and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We don’t have a second left,” said Wang, a 31-year-old human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of notoriously unique children with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050, is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said fertile couples must have babies in order to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a lack of workforce in the future.”
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive mitigation
Drafted in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government to date.
Couples who violate this policy may face huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese authorities have assigned the police a duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the execution of this policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys to girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases in which men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said central government authorities recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child have been replaced with copies of regulations detailing who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples at their homes and slip flyers under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in applications for couples wishing to have a second child after the campaign launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
Huinan commune, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu commune, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners wrongly view the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
That's right, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, head of human resources, said she only wanted one child because she was one herself. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone take care of us."
We’re not used to taking care of someone else and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation company, says it more bluntly.
For couples working in pairs, middle class, who lower the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish to succeed.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up watching their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don’t want to have that lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from his or her parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the space issues -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his resume to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not two.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, he says.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations group has draft plans for reducing emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- returned to the limelight on Friday, due to the release of a paper highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations backing most of the load, in the coming times.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as it illuminated the path to take.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in negotiations that are running out of time, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Drafted by a UN special working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support global warming, in the current and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and new emerging economies could decrease their carbon production and what the upper limit of global temperature rise would be that officials would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, representative in Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN Executive Secretary-General on Climate Change Yvo de Boer described as the “complete picture.”
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent from 1990 levels, while major developing countries, over the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also restarted negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, the U.S. climate negotiator, rejected any discussion that would require industrialized countries to reduce greenhouse gases, in comparison to the voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies if they were not funded by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is getting tougher on China than the Bush administration did two years ago.
The United States is not going to sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the major developing countries, Stern said, also regretting that the text does not insist enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the U.S. top negotiator either lacked “common sense” or was “extremely irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not help China financially to fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the world’s major powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about rescuing individual economies than rescuing the planet, with China and the U.S. wrangling over their respective obligations as poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives of acting more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it was not surprising that major powers were fighting over who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to hold large emitters accountable for their actions.
It’s really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also a Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries that are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say the negotiations will lead to at least a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission’s climate unit, said the action of small island states has “put political pressure on the entire political process,” in part by what they are now unified and asking emerging economies such as China and India, to act.
Debates became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the outstanding issues before heads of government came to an agreement.
High-level officials such as India's Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China's Deputy Minister flew down from their plane and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend closed-door meetings and news conferences, so they could make claims that would be studied over the next week.
The real picture of the rally -- in which 13,000 people walk in and out of the convention center every day -- of activist guitar players performing nightly shows mocking countries that they think are betraying themselves and that proposals are being written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the big leagues,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will break through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed commuter train will reach 225 km/h, as it rolls from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on the first Javelin commuter train outside London.
He hopes the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and will connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The small holes lost will become thriving suburban cities, the length of business trips will be much shorter and the transition from plane and car to train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds it takes to build a new rail network, the inevitable scheduling battle and fears of environmental dangers risk curbing Britain’s high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to carry out a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow it to get a detailed map of the route of the next planned step for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment may be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up up to 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also expected to present three options for a larger high-speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split into two at or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another heading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
“It looks like it’s going to be the best performance option,” said a rail professional.
When completed, travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour trip currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making it the fastest UK network in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and able to carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can run on a London-Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project needs to be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be required to run off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, maintaining travel times between London and Scotland of more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a transition from planes to trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay GBP 75,000 loan for Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, Tory's leading member of parliament, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to pay for the cost of an orangery he built in his home in his riding.
The party official who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were “sustained” increased his loan by GBP 75,000 to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He had been allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at the time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan said the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The nearby houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a “trund for pleasure.”
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee into his pre-borrowing arrangements.
The Committee cleared him last month of any charges of non-compliance, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the GBP 271,406 loan from his London property to his constituency home, which he purchased in 1991, the year before he became a member of Parliament.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was claiming about 1,400 GBP per month of borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, his requests increased by more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan’s RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the GBP 75,000 loan.
The RBS standard variable interest rate rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, unchanged since then.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to ask for GBP 1,250 in May.
Duncan lost his position as Shadow Cabinet Leader in September, after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed him saying members of parliament had to survive “on budget” after the spending scandal.
"Actually, it's now national, you have to live 'on budget' and you're treated like 'the m...e'
He said: “I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
I could have asked for more, but I didn’t.”
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil trader, began having to explain his expenses in May, after it emerged that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the office of fees that this “could be considered excessive.”
An activist dug a hole in Duncan’s lawn to protest after it was revealed that he had been asking for 4,000 GBP for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Duncan said, “It was for major improvements, approved by both the expense office and Legg.”
He added: "There is no problem with stealing or making or using rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn’t have been clearer or simpler.”
Faithful, come and see the Brighton Advent Calendar
Brighton’s beach cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabins for each December day, using Christmas carols as a theme.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30pm to 6:30pm, each day, with pâtés and mulled wine served for free.
The Christmas carols chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël", for which the booth features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest from the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a church, why do we expect people to walk into a strange old building? It seems to me that the church should get closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
“The idea of the Advent calendar from the beach cabin came right after a conversation with a few friends, over a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent that through spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to the police, some 100,000 according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, responsible for reaching by Friday an agreement that can enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chairwoman of the climate conference, said the growing mobilization on climate around the world, exemplified by these protests, helped to make the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital came shortly after the procession left, when a group of 300 protesters, all dressed in black, smashed windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist said.
Riot police immediately intervened unceremoniously.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to them members of "the Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups who had notably distinguished themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the protest, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", pointing out that a hundred of them "were still held in the street Saturday evening "handcuffed and kept in a sitting position despite the extreme cold".
Part of Parliament, the procession, rather good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, site of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter it.
A stage had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come by bus and train from the major cities of Europe, but many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoats, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying to ourselves: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying up in Africa, rivers where you can walk like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen for “the link between climate justice and social justice”: “Today, there is no cut between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world”.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, wearing bandanas touting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, gatherings of a few hundred protesters were also held to demand energetic action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian war for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The turnout was 58 percent just hours before the closing, according to Abkhaz Election Commission officials.
The first provisional results were to be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates in the running, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the poll.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili “regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia,” his spokesman Manana Manjgaladze said.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia in the 1992-1993 conflict, which left several thousand people dead, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said 54-year-old historian Svetlana Kvartchia, who said she voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station in a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a pretty white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential election in this region of sumptuous landscapes, on the edge of the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Mr Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are installed throughout this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to Russian officials who came to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said in a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow’s support, especially the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations," Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, said as he raised a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements reached with Moscow last year, such as the one ceding control over Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be held within two weeks.
Climate: events around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police, on the alert, arrested nearly 700 people on the sidelines of a massive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts until December 18 delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement that should enter into force on January 1, 2013.
As a party of Parliament, the procession, generally a good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Moments after the procession left, a group of a few hundred protesters, all dressed in black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, an AFP journalist said.
Riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened unceremoniously, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of "the Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups who had notably distinguished themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a policeman was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat during incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
We are watching the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while the police helicopters were spinning in the sky.
The majority of the demonstrators, who came by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoats, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying to ourselves: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying up in Africa, there are streams where you can walk when you have never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, told AFP he had come to Copenhagen for "the link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam mobilized several personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, the former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas touting solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, rallies of a few hundred protesters have also been held to demand action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
The history-geo comes out reinforced from the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography are emerging "enhanced" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in scientific terminal.
From now on, first-time students will all have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the minister, "it is necessary to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S track is no longer a scientific track" but "basically, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L sectors cannot remain sub-sectors of the S, he continues, stressing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals be indignant at the absence of history-geography at the end in technological high schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven in ten French (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to abolish compulsory education in history-geography in Terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some right-wing elected officials.
The minister added, however, that there was "no question" of removing the philosophy of the S-terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which according to them sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In master 2 (M2), they will pass at the beginning of the year an eligibility test that will focus on their discipline, then at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, explained the minister.
They will also take internships in situation during the year of M2 and then will be a first year in front of the students as teachers trainees.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister says that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist in the national education".
It also reaffirms the plan to remove the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince on the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the stakes of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure de la rue d'Ulm, took up on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a series of interventions by experts, of fifteen minutes each, filmed and open to the public, said an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the sidelines of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day that takes its name from the one given by the students to the fishes of the school basin.
We choose about twenty speakers from among the experts in their discipline and we select them for their charismatic side, he said.
“We can talk about the hours, but we can also talk about the key objectives in a few minutes,” Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes, but with the help of graphs, in front of about fifty people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that listeners will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
Videos from these lectures will be posted on the school’s website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Late payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
Unions of prison guards on Friday called for "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end of the year of bonuses and overtime whose payment has been postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd union of supervisors) asked the staff who will not be on duty to demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of the penitentiary institutions and to "block" them, to "denouncing the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "gather in general assemblies in the different prisons for a strong mobilization", deeming "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtime, bonuses of night, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Union fédérale autonome penitentiaire (Ufap/Unsa), “calls for a general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger”.
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime has increased significantly in 2009 and not all have been budgeted, but ensure that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing them that this payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our penitentiary system," the Minister of Justice wrote in the letter.
I have asked the management of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation resulting from a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not happen again in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The pay for December will therefore be meagre, except for the management staff benefiting from the famous bonuses of functions and objectives, lamented the Ufap / Unsa, for which "the budgetary constraints have a good back".
It is a pure scandal, has outraged the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, same for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and our missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the money of the staff, estimates the CGT-penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being worse off than others.
But anyway the account is not there, noted the secretary general of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he’s offering “nicer stuff” than the ones he gets
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, told the small-screen “papesse” Oprah Winfrey that he has a simple rule when it comes to gifts: “I give better things than the ones I get.”
As part of a special that will air Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle offer a glimpse of how they plan to celebrate the holidays in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be part of the game.
Father Christmas also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, adding that the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama has spoken out against her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: “Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year,” she teased the president.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before responding with humor by pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you this?".
During the hour-long, laid-back show, with the famous host who was a staunch supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a 10-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
“I remember that time I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball,” the president said.
It wasn’t until much later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me that balloon.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn’t know how to organize a house so I had all the furniture lined up against the wall, rather than arranging them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday says RTL is in an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to significant "lesions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated in the night from Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "lesions resulting from the operation" of the herniated disc suffered in Paris on November 26, said in Paris his press service, adding that these lesions had "needed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service said the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be released no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was however plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the condition of the patient when he has opened an eye, adds RTL.
Asked by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drain would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the Parc Monceau international clinic for this herniated disc.
The procedure, scheduled for several days, was performed by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a doctor well known in the artistic field.
It was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL information.
Following the surgery he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, for an infection following the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time", but assured himself "no worries" for the rocker, who is "a fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because doing twelve hours of flying after such an operation is not playable,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, was reassuring, saying that Johnny Hallyday "satisfactory response to antibiotics" and that the infection was "cured".
Mr. Camus had also said that he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone’s surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on with a “small colon cancer” and then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
Fans and journalists have noticed the singer's difficulties in getting around on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: Bousquet’s first on his favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time World-2009 medallist in the big pool, won an international title on Thursday over a distance he particularly likes, the 50 m freestyle, during the Euro-2009 in small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while we were expecting a surge.
One was improved by Hungary’s Evelyn Verraszto in the 200m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in the men’s relay 4x50m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, who was eyeing the world record of 50 m free, which he holds the mark in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two swimming distances, the 50 m freestyle, it is the 28-year-old Frenchman who won in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet beat Croatia’s Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russia’s Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the global mark (20.30) as he had envisioned.
You can always dream better and in this case, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from 1 January.
At the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of the suits did not serve this time to the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in large pool this summer in Rome, world records in the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the mark he holds in the 400m freestyle (3:32.77) but nevertheless won by signing the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russia’s Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Denmark’s Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t go all out on this race.
I knew I couldn’t break a world record this time but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann said.
USA: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola adjudicated 1.5 million USD
A Roman sarcophagus panel that belonged to French writer Emile Zola was auctioned Thursday $1.5 million, well above its estimate, said art dealer Sotheby's.
This front panel, two meters long by 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still in progress but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have bid the most, told AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back a few days.
The panel remained almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively in the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bathtub in her Parisian mansion, and in Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
It was an area of shadow for about 50 years.
While searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "succession Emile Zola" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart".
Attempted aborted departure from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico said Thursday that conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied safe conduct by the coup government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation with President Zelaya overnight, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for carrying out this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived Wednesday in El Salvador to bring back Mr. Zelaya, the plane of the Mexican government returned to its place of origin, according to a source of the General Directorate of Migration.
The coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad to grant him safe passage.
But the ousted president refused, because he wanted to travel to Mexico as a guest sitting head of state.
The coup government “has experienced another failure in wanting me to give up my office (...), they wanted me to resign,” Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, on which he often speaks since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added playing a few chords the deposed president, who has been a refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy has presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, said Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, on Honduran radio HRN.
"I am not seeking asylum in any country," Zelaya said in an interview with Caracas-based Telesur.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to be made as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumours of Zelaya's departure had mobilized supporters of the deposed president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military reinforced their headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the putschist government’s position.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on 21 September and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he goes out, he will be arrested to answer for the crime of "high treason" which accuses him of justice, according to the putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected in the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against Zelaya’s return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street Rises, US Trade Balance Fuels Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up higher on Thursday, with U.S. trade balance figures showing the recovery of both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67 percent and the Nasdaq 0.33 percent.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the technology-dominant Nasdaq advanced 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But it remains anecdotal, she tempered, believing that the market was focused on "the glass half full".
Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, said investors focused on the U.S. trade balance, which “shows that activity is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6 percent in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected a widening deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth in the economies of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new jobless enrolments in the United States increased against all expectations last week, reaching 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “has fallen to the lowest level in a year,” said Wells Fargo Advisors’ Scott Marcouiller.
The bond market has declined.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bill rose to 3.482% from 3.423 percent on Tuesday night and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of power conspire against the "Ladies in White"
A few hundred supporters of Cuban power on Thursday conspired with the wives of political detainees gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
About 40 "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were conspired in the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they marched towards the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, said an AFP journalist.
Down with the Yankees!, “mercenaries!”, “the street belongs to the revolutionaries!”, “Long live Fidel and Raul!” chanted, with raised fists, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
They were escorted by plainclothes agents who came to "ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate Thursday for the International Human Rights Day were arrested by plainclothes police, a journalist from AFP said.
Police forced dissidents into civilian vehicles that were conspired by supporters of the government, according to the journalist.
Interpellations of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Recipients of the European Parliament's 2005 Sakharov Prize, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to the dissent, said Laura Pollan, their leader, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is among 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain in custody.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration of pro-government activists against “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of flouting rights and freedoms, including expression.
An angry man kills an octogenarian with a knife and injures 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
An angry man armed with two knives killed an octogenarian and injured five other people in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of affluence, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the attacker, 28 years old, would have struck with two knives and for unknown reasons, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy of 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, we learned from police sources and witnesses.
Severely injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to an official of the police union Alliance, died in hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of this same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, in his thirties, stepped in and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenarian died.
The other injured man's days are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became unwell and was reportedly hospitalized "in shock", according to a police source.
The gunman, who seemed under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He allegedly injured two passers-by, apparently at random: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter seriously.
The script was confusing in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher's knives that he wore on a cross behind his back, explained on the spot an official of the union Alliance in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies gathered by AFP, tried to control the madman.
I saw a guy in his thirties with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept it.
They didn't get there because the guy was tough, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, reported.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Always boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of n°61, two municipal police officers, including their manager, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded with punches, according to police sources.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many businesses are located.
Passersby came to tell me that there was a wounded person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a safety position, and I saw a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person in his 30s arrived, wounded with a knife.
National police officers arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office has referred the investigation to the Departmental Judicial Police Service of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The patient was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard as part of his custody.
A police source did not rule out that he would be interned in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to subdue him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of over-excitement" like "all the madmen of this species whose forces increase tenfold under the effect of the action".
US: Polanski's lawyer again calls for prosecution to be dropped
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has called again Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the abandonment of the prosecution against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a case of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of the "Pianiste", has denounced before three judges of the Court of Appeal of the second district of California of serious errors of procedure at the time of the facts, in 1977.
I am calling for the charges to be dropped here and now, Hummel said, before adding that the behavior of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, was "cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has since died -- had a discussion with a prosecutor before handing down his sentence, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which is a serious lack of due process.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared in late September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to drop the charges, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present evidence of his case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no drop of charges could be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled the United States in 1978, before the sentencing, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old girl.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Polanski “must be there to appear at the hearing.”
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to escape?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "demands a favor from the court, while disregarding its authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also pointed out "that there were other alternatives to the leak."
Mr. Hummel was not alone in calling for the prosecution of Roman Polanski to be dropped.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, has also called for an end to the prosecution.
Recalling that her client can no longer bear to be harassed with every twist in the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was right.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on a US arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, pending possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, slowed by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market torn between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technology-dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains within narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the release of better-than-expected economic indicators, which “helped to improve market opinion on the strength of the economic recovery,” said analysts Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
U.S. consumer confidence also picked up sharply in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan’s preliminary estimate.
However, the indexes have been held back by a new rise in the dollar, the highest in two months against the euro, which "pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
As a result, technology stocks have lost ground.
The bond market has declined.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bill rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday evening and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
Miss World's election once again in South Africa
After a month of journey through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the Miss World title are preparing to cross the last straight on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great mass of beauty organized for the second year in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss sports or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was amazing.
“I’ve seen so many things and had so many experiences!” exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast Saturday live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I couldn’t dream of a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have experienced it twice, stresses Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the austral summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "the breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Misses are now focusing on competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and running in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both become Bollywood stars.
It’s every woman’s dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
“We are ambassadors for our countries and I want to go home with the crown,” Miss India said with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costume and of course in swimwear.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee leader Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, went on a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their best memory will undoubtedly remain the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've dated people I never thought I'd be able to get close to.
I will definitely come back for the 2010 World Cup, Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi enthuses.
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive", says son David
The news of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive", assured Friday his son David on his arrival at the airport of Los Angeles where he had to go to the bedside of his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, it is going very well, told the press David Hallyday when he left the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13:00 local (21:00 GMT).
The singer’s son, who looks relaxed, said he was going to go “very quickly” to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Hallyday had previously been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be re-operated in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade is educated, to attend a school show, a photographer from AFP found.
The head of orthopedic and trauma surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer violently questioned Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
I have heard about a possible legal process ahead, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday had "gone far too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Paris surgeon".
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it amazed me, given that I had two herniated discs myself, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "left without drain, without anything", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic world.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practiced at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resolve a hematoma following a cerebral hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, condemned several times by the justice, in cases of medical liability, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and which is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He said the procedure went "perfectly well" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the installation of a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ed) as expected, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF association raises the tone and tells the New Centre not to use its acronym anymore
The association UDF, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted Friday to the attempt of OPA of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardian party, warning him not to use it on any support, under penalty of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defense, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the NC National Council.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (former UMP past NC) who claims ownership of the UDF trademark for having been the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday night, the office of the association UDF, controlled by friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to be dispossessed, came out of his silence to issue a formal notice to the minister and the deputy, warning them not to use the acronym and to pass on the ownership of the brand, under penalty of legal proceedings.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements indicating that you are going to propose to your political movement to "take back" the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of MoDem, as well as the senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it good to forward on your militant material and on the front page of your site, the name of this movement, the "New center", the slogan "the UDF of today", also note the signatories of the mail.
As you know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the office of the UDF which warns the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF of any medium as well as of (its) website".
He also asked Hervé de Charette "to pass on the ownership of (the) trademark to its legitimate rights holders".
If you did not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they specify that the UDF "is a political movement in its own right since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
According to them, the New Centre has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its membership to the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending "material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, continues the office, "when he filed the trademark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but at the UMP.
He takes advantage scandalously and fraudulently of the lack of deposit of the acronym UDF to carry it out on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironizing on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for oneself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled".
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine, as accused by the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenarian to rob her of part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this saga-worthy case about one of France’s wealthiest families, in which mother and daughter tear each other apart while holding the reins of the L’Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th correctional chamber has also ordered that a medical assessment of Liliane Bettencourt, 87, should be conducted collegially by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, at least not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre prosecutor's office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report before March 10, 2010 saying in particular if Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she will submit to it.
I'll talk to him about it," Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said at the end of the hearing.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady who must be protected, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed criminal charges against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and hard-working artist, who she accuses of having taken advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
While the court was to consider the admissibility of the action initiated by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the pleadings of the lawyers sometimes turned to large family unpacking Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer mentioned three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was wary of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I have never been able to talk to her since her marriage.”
For its part, the Nanterre public prosecutor's office again found that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially since a guardianship judge refused in recent days to grant her request to open judicial protection proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to take legal action, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in her place," said prosecutor Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers.
The managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees, recalls the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of making employees adhere to "values" determined from above as it used to be, to impose on consumers products thought by the technicians of the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering markets back in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from customer preference factors returns regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emergent part of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilisation seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, in particular R&D and, even more, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI “requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision”; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that the recipes of authoritarian management totally oppose.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put employees at the center of the company’s concerns as well as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all because I could see that, faced with a new situation, any structure finally arrives, after many detours, to do priority... which it has always done.
Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Coming from the great engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behavioral theory, reactivated recently by the American "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr strengthens the leaders in a posture of mechanistic governance, unsuitable for the world today.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating, in any reasoning or governance practice, a fundamental observation: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to achieve a part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies resulting from the Functional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resources management "in place".
They thus create a favourable ground for the concerted development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: 'Just War' is worth praise to right to Obama
The American right on Friday welcomed the speech delivered the day before in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had mocked the award to Mr. Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Ms. Palin, the Republican Party’s right wing muse, told USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the topic of war “sometimes necessary” in her newly published memoirs.
War is, of course, the last thing the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop these terrorists there, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done a “very good job” in Oslo.
I thought the speech was really good, said the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
In some ways, I found this speech quite historic, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed during the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected official, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen "a leftist president" remind the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush reconverted columnist at the Washington Post, Mr. Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it", said Mr. Gerson.
Among the few on the right not to be convinced, a Bush-era hawk, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, called the speech “dull, charred, and uninspired” on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When you wrap the war in the notion of justice, you can easily justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained glowing with praise for the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech a "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the daily said.
Obama “made the right speech,” the New York Times said, calling him “both dark and uplifting.”
Roads: three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three sessions of negotiations-marathon, the unions of the road sector and TLF, the only employers' organization to have remained until the end, have reached Friday evening an agreement that ends the slogan of strike and the threat to the supplies of Christmas.
During the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "rejoiced" by this agreement, after several sessions of negotiations, started Wednesday morning.
After a second night of talks, the negotiators had parted ways in the early morning on Friday, with the hope of quickly signing the agreement text in the late morning.
And this even if three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OUR) had slammed the door.
But it took still more than six hours of a meeting started at 11am for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed at 6pm.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "it was to be feared that it would disrupt the holiday season," Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest salaries (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rate, for low-wage earners, "we go from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but we start from a very far, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we will give orders to our militants that there are no blockades, no blockades of supply centers.
But we can always have a few recalcitrants who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, praised "a good deal", even though it was "difficult to concede the increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) called it an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3%, and the holding of general statements of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will notably address the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of 100 million euros of employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the bill of amending finance for 2009, voted on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote it "in identical terms".
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to apply first to companies that are members of this organization, and second, to the entire profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible", assured Mr. Bussereau.
Opposition from employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "market of dupes", because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate urgently, not as a conclusion of a shared analysis, but so as not to upset the turkey eaters of the next New Year's Eve, lamented Unostra.
For the Otre, the agreement risks "digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions unhappy with RATP proposals
Disruptions on the RER A, France’s largest urban transit line, will continue over the weekend, as a meeting Friday on the 2nd day of strike between unions and RATP management left them hungry for their premium demand.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be trains between 10:00 and 20:00, at the rate of one train out of two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train out of four outside the central section.
Interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers every day, was delighted that "the RATP is making efforts to serve department stores".
The RER A crosses from west to east the Paris conurbation.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains operated during rush hour, and almost no trains in off-peak hours, as expected.
Like Thursday, there was no rush on the docks, the Ile-de-France had organized.
Thus in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, especially because of the absence of middle and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen “an hour and a half earlier, to be sure to arrive on time”.
The Saint-Lazare station did not experience saturation, said the SNCF, which had planned a supervision of agents and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left Saint-Lazare station to reach the metros.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, deemed "lean" by the unions, of a meeting with the management on Friday afternoon.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, who demand a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, was indignant the CGT, stressing that the management "was not screwed to solve a problem while at the drivers and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader review of the conditions of practice of the profession," said the RATP.
The unions were also told that the company was "laughing at weekend users".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, which until then refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in a concern of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen to RER B on Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain of the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the million daily travelers.
The drivers of RER, all in the second part of their career, receive from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros in premiums, for staggered hours, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish Justice Dissolves Pro-Kurdish Party, Ruling With Consequences
Turkey’s Constitutional Court on Friday ruled on the dissolution of the country’s main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry protests in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is likely to greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a “home of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,” Court President Hasim Kiliç told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, said Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party's cadres, including its president Ahmet Turk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Turk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as unlabelled parliamentarians.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, said it had "no organic ties" to the PKK but refused to call it a terrorist organization and called on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government has reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, in an attempt to dry up Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders had said a breakup could lead to heightened tensions in southeastern Anatolian, where numerous protests against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan have escalated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Upon the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large city in the south-east populated mainly by Kurds.
Law enforcement fired tear gas canisters and used water cannons, as protesters threw molotov cocktails or stones, with slingshots.
A hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Tork claimed that the decision of the Justice will "deepen despair".
Turkey cannot solve this issue by banning a party, he told reporters.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very harsh winter.
But the head of the road clearing and sandblasting service (FES) makes it clear that this is not to annoy citizens.
It is simply so that the agents can test the technique of the vehicles and learn to master them well.
And according to the meteorologists, it could well be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles stand ready to tackle snow and ice.
The FES follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to snow on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, large sandblasting vehicles run along 20 main routes (referred to as A routes).
This includes high-traffic streets, main thoroughfares, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstrasse.
Also included are fire brigade access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as the Atzelbergstrasse.
The FES agents begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
In case of need, the 1040 kilometers of road must be salted with a road melt that adheres well, in 3 hours of time maximum.
This is why the FES service starts at 3am "so that the roads are clear when the daily migration traffic begins".
Where it gets harder is when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the head of the service of clearing and sandblasting of the roads "because no motorist is willing to let through the salting vehicles".
Then, if it does not snow anymore, we take care of access roads and service roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Strasse.
Side lanes and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger knows that there are always a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrian team set off to clear priority areas deemed dangerous and passages.
As for bike paths, the FES services generally cannot take care of them.
Brauburger said there is a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the condition of the bridges between 10 p.m. and 4:30 a.m.
As ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
Sometimes the police also call on this special service in case of need.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long and 1.50 meters high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended in sickle claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues reported in Thursday’s Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological features.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was at the time part of the land of the supercontinent, Pangaea and was towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of the Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us about the relationships, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team says they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day, which is absolutely unique for a Triassic sedimentary layer.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
Excavations have uncovered the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories concerning the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
Researchers named it Tawa after the Hopi Indians' word for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a very exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare and are limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he points out that it allows to confirm certain theories concerning the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the very first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, when the saurians were divided into three major evolutionary groups: theropods (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaurus and the velociraptor which later appeared and from which descend the birds, sauropods, long-necked quadrupeds, and those related to them and the ornithischian herbivores of which the species such as the ornithischian are part.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species has an interesting relationship of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found evidence that the Tawa hallae had small air sacs in its bones at the level of the skull, just like birds that are descendants of theropods.
These small pockets of air make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It appears that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air sacs in its bones.
As the related line of the immense sauropods also possessed air sacs and a light bone, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, the researchers concluded that saurians had appeared there.
As a result, the three great evolutionary lineages divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. all the landforms that formed the supercontinent Pangea.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor that may have migrated, the researchers say.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says there is an even older species, the silesaur, that lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a dinosaur-like group.
According to him, this could give a wrong view because there are in South America a large number of dinosaur fossils that have been preserved while practically none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of current crocodiles and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread all over the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and the Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or else, dinosaurs were better suited and so they were able to eliminate the competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favorite meteorite blossomed from a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic and that since that time vegetated in the shadows: they were mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those of lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec City, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the casino from J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt is making waves all over the world.
278 professors and lecturers from J.W. Goethe University and other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they condemned the police intervention demanded by the university's steering committee.
Last week, the president of the Werner Mueller-Estler University evacuated buildings occupied by striking students and teachers after walls and artwork were smeared with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories believe that the degradations did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commando against the students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation represents an "unacceptable interference" with freedom of research and education.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to “delegitimize and criminalize the protest” and attempts to forget the reasons for the mobilization.
The Steering Committee of the University has thus avoided the debates that would be essential.
The court officials demand that the criminal proceedings initiated be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the damage.
Legitimization of protests
Young people from the Verdi service union and the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
The protests are just a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Verdi’s regional youth secretary.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kuehne-Hurmann (CDU), she took up the cause for the action initiated by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the regional parliament of Wiesbaden last Thursday during the television show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU Member of the Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU is taking the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the students’ arguments and demands, we evacuate them.
The Left Party has tabled a motion that requires the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new “Silicon Valley”
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of search for secret weaponry, under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the town has a reputation as the Soviet "Silicon Valley".
Important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
As early as September 2008, representatives from Zelenograd established links with Riedberg, the place of science in Frankfurt – with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives from Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a “Protocol of Close Collaboration”.
The signatories were Moscow Vice-Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz Head of Project Section for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the rapidly expanding Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific societies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is home to famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
It includes the Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literal translation “Green City”) takes its name from the wooded hills at the heart of which the research centers are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed high enough.
For its supporters it is nothing less than the “new heart of Europe”.
S21 is much more than the burying of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Wuerttemberg, into a desperate chaos of construction sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
Head-end stations, with tracks that ended in the middle of the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of 19th century transport technology that acted as the brake shoe of modern rail traffic because it once took a long time to get locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – this is what needs to be done.
This is why the train stations at the head of the line have to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart too: a train station, which is about halfway on the Trans-European Railway Magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, hence the slogan "the heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, the stations at the head end of the line no longer pose any real problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with railcars and pilot car at both ends.
However, the construction of Stuttgart 21 is now underway next to the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and municipal policies prevailed.
The railway company is on the side because it is the taxpayer who bears the risks of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public company.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
One obtains an urban space that – if one believes the graphs of computer generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The station of passage and the enlargement of the section are designed for a traffic of persons to which was attributed - and it is typical of the 80s - a huge growth.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than trucking on the road.
But the new layout, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabian project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade this money will be missing for other junctions and bottlenecks in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport mentions a total of sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the widening of the section through the Rhine valley by 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to press the mushroom here thoroughly.
But the S21 project has the effect of a brake shoe.
The Rhine Valley route is on its way to becoming the bottleneck for international freight traffic right in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews decision on airport
In the Regional Parliament of Wiesbaden, the Land Government raised the possibility of appealing to the judgment of the Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night flights.
Minister of the Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had appointed experts to review the Administrative Tribunal’s ruling from a legal perspective, which is a document with more than 400 pages.
The Kassel court had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights in the event that the project of construction of the north-west landing strip of Frankfurt airport would be carried out.
The authorisation to land 17 aircraft between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nocturnal air pollution.
The coalition must have decided by January 4 if it wishes to appeal in cassation against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticized this delay and tried to pressure the government representative to file an appeal with the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schaefer-Gambel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections to ban night flights, otherwise it will be considered a total breach of a given word.
It’s damn hard to be allowed to keep his word, Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, alluding to the FDP’s election slogan “We keep our promises.”
Minister Dieter Posch refutes the reproaches of Schaefer-Gambel who claims that the Land government is trying to allow night flights anyway by using "avocasserie and roubladises".
It takes time to complete an accurate legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "quick first impression".
The decision needs to be legally reliable, says Stefan Muller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of its faction's statements on the night-flight ban is completely flawed.
U.S. banks repay aid
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, are breaking their ties with the state.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it has paid back $45 billion (more than 30 billion euros) in full to the Treasury, corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
The US television channel CNBC said in a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid received.
Banking institutions thus seek to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of sums, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to managers as well as the settlement of higher fees.
The Bank of America launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors that brought it $19 billion in new money.
The rest of the sum comes from the bank's coffers, which are well filled through the sale of several branches from other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, the CEO of Bank of America, expressly thanked the American taxpayers: the injection of capital has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capabilities by buying investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to raise money in the financial markets in order to free itself from state control.
The US bank could launch as early as Thursday a capital increase of 20 billion dollars, reported the channel CNBC citing banking circles.
The Citigroup spokesperson did not want to comment on this information.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
In the end, everything went faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor has already been appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs ZDF’s Berlin editorial team, was the big favourite.
However, the channel did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also a desire not to further harm the ZDF intendant Markus Schaechter in the event that the proposal was not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schachter’s candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14 members of the Commission.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schoechter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract by five years, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had voted in favour of Brender's reappointment and 7 others had voted against it.
Indeed, the CDU, which is the majority on the Board of Directors, had already hinted several weeks before the vote, not to want to return Brender to his position.
Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, had organized a league against the editor.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief on the grounds that the rate of listening to ZDF news broadcasts had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, criticizing the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end there were even 35 public law experts who had interfered in the debate and who felt that Koch’s way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it won't help.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He went on to work at the Rhineland-Palatinate radio station S?dwestfunk and the German national radio station Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 he became an editor at the ZDF, first of all at the "heute-journal" news magazine (today's newspaper).
From 1988 to 1990 he was deputy editor-in-chief at the time; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (biweekly news program presented in the morning); until 2001 he was head of the foreign policy department of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial board.
After Brender's disgrace, when he had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialist magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch’s opponent on the Board, Rhineland-Palatinate Minister-President Kurt Beck, said last week that the L-nder should transform the ZDF’s Intergovernmental Treaty so that the intendant’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a biased political majority.
However, Beck has no plans to call for the removal of political figures who are members of the ZDF's supervisory committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had skillfully maneuvered before the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to fire Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schoechter was able to propose him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without being expected to place a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified liberal of the left.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for the students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Lands decide to be more conciliatory: during a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the rectors' conference, an agreement was reached stipulating that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the weight of the examinations: a single examination should close the chosen study module.
In addition, the workload will have to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
In addition, the Lands have committed themselves to organising more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master programmes.
At regional level, there must be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the L?nder and the rectors of universities have always had the fashionable expression: "studentship".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on concrete meaning.
The accreditation board has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain exams: "Each module should normally be able to be concluded by a single exam," reads a thirty-page document on future conditions for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, it should be possible to stop slippages, which significantly affected the studyability.
"Studyability" should also be the decisive criterion for the organization of studies in the future.
Both the modules and the background need to be examined carefully to see if we can avoid this choking sensation that we sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge about Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should “have the opportunity and the leeway to enable and foster personal initiative.”
The new regulations will concern access to new university courses but will also be adapted to existing ones.
These cycles must be "re-accredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accrediting agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accrediting councils set up by the federal states.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Lands to put pressure on the agencies so that the programmes were not too burdensome and the examination system not too strict.
In some states, universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only state to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorial programs and strengthen the educational guidance offices as well as the examination offices and the international relations department.
For this purpose, the Lander and the universities are planning a budget of 10 million euros.
In early 2010, the government wanted to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
After that, you will only have to take one exam to finish your studies.
The organization of studies will have to be more flexible, in addition it must be possible to guarantee the recognition of the transcripts of other higher education institutions and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the studyability" of all university cycles will have had to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the question of the conditions of study in the country.
The decisions were appreciated but criticism was heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students has indicated that he would like that the organization of educational policy does not happen in the future "behind the closed doors" of ministers and rectors of universities.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as concerned persons should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of the students is very useful to us", she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Lands with which the HRK is working on a common reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for each graduate Bachelor to enroll in a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the steering committee of the GEW, also asks that the Landers assure today's Bachelor students that tomorrow there will be enough places for Master's studies and the best possible study conditions.
The Lander must therefore hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of reducing access to the Master.
More than just a footnote on Herta Muller
It is with these words "Arrival in Germany and it's beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work by the poet Werner Soellner, in which he thematizes in fragments of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, Werner Soellner was first a professor of German and English in Bucharest and later a collector at a youth publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
In 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the artist's house in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the distorting mirror and mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly destabilised and embarrassed, he made a statement in which he acknowledged to fellow German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
In 1989 he received the German Language Prize together with some of the participants.
Enrolment trials began insidiously in 1971.
“So I’m someone who hasn’t been able to resist enough of the Securitate’s intimidation tests.”
The poet Werner Soellner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoring of the Nobel Prize for Herta Muller and its exemplary literary unravellings with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abysses and the baseness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Soellner is, as far as we can tell from current knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own case Securitate, IM Walter played a role, says literature specialist Michael Markel after S?llner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
“He was able to get him out of all the difficult situations at the time,” Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which he made his statement and in front of this audience was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Muller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after having read the 914 pages of his own file.
One can assume that the victims will have made speculations and will sometimes have guessed which real names were hidden last the borrowed names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
In contrast to Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
Systematic clarification has been repeatedly thwarted and curbed in past years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the restitution of the files has rather dragged on since.
Since 2005, there has been a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former official of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Muller, expressed himself very disdainful towards the laureate.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she had only been questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it could express itself here, without any genes, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Admittedly, there are many inescapable issues associated with the Soellner case, as so often happens in a context of hidden guilt.
The weighted reaction of the listeners, according to Suellner, gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Muller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
tumults in the Champions League
It felt like a representative was coming in there, pulled at four pins straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sporting goods manufacturer had spread its goods when the new VFB trainer Christian Gross went up at midnight minus a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier in hand.
The man, whose bald head attracted the attention, let himself be led into the city which was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our 50-year-old could have driven himself – he hadn’t drunk alcohol and he wasn’t drunk with happiness either.
He had a pleasant evening but tomorrow we had to go back to work.
Because now it was going to start.
The words of the Swiss that we had just started three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth of the final", that is to say in the league of champions thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not be blinded by the success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall again".
The “big work” awaits us on Sunday.
There, it is a question of repeating to Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And it will be necessary to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three quick goals of Marica (5.), Trosch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Draw
The eighth Champions League final (match go 16./17. + 23./24 February/ match return 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on 18. December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel's successor's fulminant entry into office was therefore moderate.
And the joy wasn’t only for the lucky one, who passed on unsettled motivation and fun to the Stuttgart pros.
I went to the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I advised them to be braver, explained the "plumber of souls" - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so good but that no longer made effects with the healer Babbel.
He triggered a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - a supporter of Babbel -, "in football when there is a new impulse sometimes things happen that one would never have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of injury break, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" seen by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "He is someone who takes action and requires discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the mark, warns manager Horst Heldt
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart especially needs tenacity.
Just like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with the 0:4, objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We have not yet passed the difficult course.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday did not have the heart to party, even after the first home win in three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a televised interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann bounced back just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered, in response to Lehmann's sharp criticism.
He had accused the management of style weakness and said she had decided to change coach under pressure from pubertal fans.
Lehmann had also seen it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his free day after the games had been taken away from him.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure egoism,” Heldt said, announcing consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer in danger of becoming lifelong friends of these two middle-aged men.
In any case, they agreed on everything else, that is to say that without the previous work of the group by the replaced coach, the strong sporting and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "a big part of the success" retorted Heldt and Lehmann in chorus - and even the man with the plastic bag acquiesced.
World Heavyweight Championship
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly provoked verbally and gesturally the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title of heavyweight world champion according to the version of the WBC federation.
By unanimous vote of the judges, he took the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as world heavyweight champion.
The WBC federation announced that on the night of Saturday the 38-year-old champion had won in points at the unaminity of the judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has defended his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had twice won the WBO and WBC World Championship.
Unfortunately, he did not achieve the long-awaited knockout.
Klitschko, who won 39 times in 41 professional fights, had to admit twice his defeat due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Bern Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of his 2.02 meters, by his left against.
Johnson, eleven centimeters smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the blows of the champion, thus preventing Klitschko to bring into play his dangerous right counter.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his blows rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having crossed with Klitschko the distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko as a "villain zombie" who "is not really capable."
During Friday’s weigh-in, the champion couldn’t help but provoke Johnson by knocking his sunglasses off his nose “so he could see his eyes.”
Fourth win since Klitschko’s comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth bout since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten then Nigerien Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year, defending his title of champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the United States.
“I just took a hit in this fight and I’m in perfect shape,” Klitschko said of his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to reunite the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is a champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was scheduled to take place in September.
It seems that his promotion company is planning to have this match played at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz Affair
Frontal attack by the opposition: the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jurgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defense Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz Affair.
The SPD and the Left (die Linke) ask the Chancellor for an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest intelligence on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has blamed Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) for deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister has intentionally "formulated a falsehood" about the deadly strike of two tankers last September, said the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jurgen Trittin, Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD channel "Tagesschau" (the newspaper of 20h).
In other words, it means he lied.
The order to kill was given in complete disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO, which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the objective of the strike was actually not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or wounded in the US airstrike that was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Kunduz’s military commander.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to vote as soon as possible in front of the Federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Trittin and her colleague from the Green party Renate Konast are of the opinion that Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Government and whether the chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellery in no way influenced the military's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were growing to express doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had given Guttenberg about the attack on the tankers was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden some embarrassing details from the Minister.
The entourage of the two senior officials, however, suggests that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert has meanwhile asked in a letter for clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer.
On Saturday, the Department declined to comment on the charges and referred the matter to the federal Parliament's inquiry committee, which was to be set up the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The worlds of dreams
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in psychic patients, or under the effect of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our darkened rooms, we can indulge unhindered in the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, he who, when awake, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, soon has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in psychic patients or under the effect of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but which sometimes pushes the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, in the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect stand out, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of neurotransmitting substances in the brain - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achetylcholine - breaks down and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts very often occur during schizophrenic psychosis.
The earth's force of attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always focused on the relationship between madness and dreams.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of waking-dream; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
It's autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic book character.
His body is in two dimensions with garish colors.
Earth's attraction no longer has any power over him, he's hovering above the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him are winged, grimacing devil creatures, bleeding mouths, showing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over the body.
Loud, nasty, screaming voices coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of his stereo, loops it and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and passes the loop around the neck.
He jumps.
The loop comes off.
Let it serve as a lesson for you, shout the voices in a choir to snatch his eardrum. "Go to a clinic and get treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last one is 2 years old, the first one is almost 20 years old.
It was triggered by LSD.
Diagnosis: schizoaffective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is manic-depressive, it takes drugs for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness and has been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despairs.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their lifetime from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the people concerned can no longer tell the difference between the inner world and the outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitement, which can cause them to suffer hallucinations, megalomania, relationship madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitetsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is right in the middle of the situation, all with a meaning centered on him.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the ability to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experiencing a hallucination once in a lifetime.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, “the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis, is basically preserved.”
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the lived takes place in a real setting.
Why our brains make this kind of cabrioles, is always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that the people involved have very small brain damage.
It is assumed that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what is still unexplained is the way in which the abnormality of the neural system occurs and furthermore the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats up.
What’s crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Luebeck, is that psychotics suffer from hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusory image phenomena for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also of an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising to find that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are prone to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are overactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain heats up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state just like a brain injury or psychosis.
But also lack of stimulus, stress, heartbreak or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants admitted to experiencing a hallucination at least once in their lifetime.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania and goes to high school.
It’s a normal girl, really.
If there were no images and voices.
During the recess, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long brown hair, speaks to him.
When she answers her friends look at her, amazed – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think that this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K does not dream, she is sure of it.
She is awake, hearing and seeing this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even sense his presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young friendly.
Am I crazy? she asks herself sometimes.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are, in general, frightening.
Often the visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to take the class because the teacher is just introducing a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations to the board.
At night the apparitions are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for sleep that arrives too rarely and far too late, she often cannot make the distinction if she is awake or already dreaming, if the images she sees, the grinning faces or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs lie before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she cries out to these creatures.
She doesn't tell her parents or her friends, they'd think she was crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She got her baccalaureate last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact with psychologist Kasten via the internet, she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or doesn’t have enough stimulation, the likelihood is high that they will have hallucinations after a while.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, so there's animation.
Sarah K., the only daughter, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was old enough to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it’s very difficult for people like Sarah K to tell the difference between illusion and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychoses.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
This is why Kasten advises her patients to cherish hallucinations as a special talent.
There is only one step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness, we unfortunately quickly tend to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Dusseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious illness, painful but also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oniroid form of experience, a particular form of dream-induced consciousness modification.
Oniroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
The oneroid state of consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies such as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully aware, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that harms his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation that is in itself intolerable, an organizational capacity that is given to us, men, so as not to sink into the nothingness of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich-based art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as an action to save the soul.
He is 49 years old, when his conscious mind goes on a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; meanwhile, his body is condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he has created from scratch, visits foreign places, travels back in time. He sees himself as an old man in bed in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lived in the Middle Ages among nobles who made blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a Greek on a motorcycle who takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
He absorbs himself completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes, describing what he experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations, and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in the waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, Kasten summarizes, “can cause a distortion of what we call reality.”
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snow can fall
Burda
At 27 years old, the children will take over the publishing house.
Kallen’s appointment as CEO of Burda is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at 27 and are firmly committed to integrating into society, Hubert Burda, 69, told The Spiegel.
All details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
It will also be necessary to see if they are capable of doing so.
You cannot impose your children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
It would destroy the children as well as the business.
Burda announced last Thursday that he was retiring from the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
First of all, he was responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently he was in charge of the Treasury sector, i.e. he was in charge of the capital of the company, and after the departure of Todenhaefer he also took over the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a member of the family who is at the head of the Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17, respectively, and her son Felix, now 42, died a few years ago.
The naming of Kallen also serves to make the link of the next 10 or 15 years.
Burda says the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families that have been dragged along by a bulimia of capital, who have made huge unfortunate speculations that they could climb ever higher.
That was never my strategy.
“I’ve never had a dream of universal power,” Burda said.
I absolutely do not see myself in the role of tutor of the country as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken much too much importance.
Full Beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the goal that El Corte Inglés seems to have set itself, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food section, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relax area to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax with a session of jacuzzi, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, there are 250 m2 divided into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facials, body treatments and hydrotherapy.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual “trainers” who guide the steps of customers, by offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (heating and stretching included), are enough to work all the muscles of the body.
And, if after working our body, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi sign has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Varied necklines
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our festive wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona get the electric car
The electrical company Endesa, in collaboration with the Ayuntamiento de Barcelona, created the "Oficina LIVE".
This is a project to develop and promote electric vehicles in the Catalan capital.
The "Oficina LIVE" (Logistics for the Implantation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the installation of the electric car in the city and will set up agreements concerning mobility, by carrying out procedures, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the Movele Plan, to launch the implementation of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
Among the latter are activities related to energy, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative Endesa is involved in when it comes to the promotion of the electric car.
The company takes part in standardization groups on a European scale and has a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees “a future of tranquility” for the engine industry
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, sees "a future of tranquility" for the Spanish car industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
During the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without a Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production sites,” said the President of the Government.
“Thanks to this plan and the brands’ decision to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can envisage a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), has devoted 800 million euros to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilized an investment of more than 3,000 million euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government measures to support demand, alluding to Plan 2000E, which was put in place in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and contributed to a “strong increase” in registrations, which increased by “40 per cent” in November.
20,000 m2 of classic cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Classic Car Show, a meeting place for professionals and enthusiasts of the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellon de Cristal in the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
It has an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only will you be able to find motorcycles and vintage cars, but you will also find at ClassicAuto Madrid items of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, at the exhibitors of the pavilion, we will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the collector engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Clasicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and catering, or Cochera Clasicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Outdoor aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this show will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Fitness tests with vintage cars and motorcycles will also be held on a circuit outside the exhibition centre.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Sustainable sportsmanship
Mazda intends to prove that sportsmanship is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated into the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is only available on the 2.0 150-horsepower petrol engine.
This second generation Mazda3 is illustrated by the good rating it has obtained as a whole.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driver’s seat, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and attachment.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control panel and console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
Continuing with the interior, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this is a large chest with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for now, is only available on the two-liter, 150-horsepower petrol engine and with manual six-speed changeover.
This engine is a real happiness. It is distinguished by its finesse, low noise, its services and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most requested Mazda3 are the diesel models, those who do not drive a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high comfort of speed and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, in other words the one with the largest number of standard elements.
Among the standard equipment, the Lane Change Assist (RVM) that removes blind spot, traction and stability controls, cruise control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly noteworthy.
In addition, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for 1,500 euros more, includes among other elements adaptable bi-xenon headlights and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly distinguished by the quality of the materials used, by its behavior and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not drive many kilometres per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 150-horsepower 2.0 petrol engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21 770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23 270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
The “First” of Luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark "lady".
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at your email, without offering the possibility even to see certain type of attachments or browse the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
In truth, it’s harder to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half the cost, for example, of the iPhone data subscription.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American older brother, but comes with a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately look for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult his mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and has been working for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
Repeated reminders from the European Commission to offer affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely noticeable effect.
Outside of their country of origin, they are reluctant to use the data, and they are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have Wi-Fi) offers this type of rates, means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals allowing them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other internet searches.
No subscription and no hassle.
It is a connected device and you pay when you buy it, not every month.
And this is what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with lifetime access as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is, without a doubt, the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the office of Barack Obama in the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, she chose, indeed, the same to accompany him in the second moment, without doubt, the most important of his life: the awarding in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar pattern on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow drawing towards the green with brilliant reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabrics, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So much so that at a first glance, it seems that the first lady of the United States follows in the wake of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to put on the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If for the taking of office it was a thick lace, on the other hand, she wore in Oslo a printed velvet.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with medium heel for the first occasion, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now lifted while she was wearing them loose the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their maternity
Discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generation who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study "Feudality and professional career of women in Spain", carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have had their professional careers limited because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether or not the woman works and the type of job held.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time or have an unstable job, get into a relationship earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women with stable jobs, mainly in the public sector, push back entry into life as a couple and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling in as a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised largely influences maternity, but less the date of beginning of common life, "explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
Education is another factor that widens the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference also remains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35- to 49-year-old group, those with elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average, respectively.
“Another distinction also appears between women, depending on their level of education.
While those with elementary education get married and have their first child before finding stable employment, those with middle or higher education reverse this program and prioritize getting stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the brand, intoning the universal motto “Because I’m worth it”.
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities registered at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club so select were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
For men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
Prices of British Fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its greatest representatives, designers and models, past and present, gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Ex-model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, named Best Model of the Year.
The Ace Poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographs" of writers who went through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
He does not do it according to predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by seeking something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither frights nor illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to readings and proofreadings.
I'll leave you with a few snapshots.
On Albert Camus: “In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the very one I felt without naming it: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god.”
On Samuel Beckett: “Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between helplessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that nearly killed him.”
On Graham Greene: “Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven by the way of perdition.”
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-thousand-meter peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north face, on which the best mountaineers are still loose and always taken."
William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
By himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
These two dreams were grand.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: “This writer collected the demented cry uttered from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the depths of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and he did so in the flight of himself and invoking the posteriority with a violent speech to the maggots.”
On Dorothy Parker: “One day she knelt down and prayed, ‘Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman.’
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser: "Sleep after effort,/ after the storm the port,/ rest after war,/ after life, tired death delights."
On Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband very normally agreed that she would tell him that Edward VII was watching him between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was beyond madness.
“What did Marton-Santos do but try to hide Joyce at Baroja’s house?
What's Benet trying to do if it's not to have Faulkner shoot Baroja?
What did it do but to seek the glory of this man to be his pedestal?”
A cowardly attack
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a blood-mele, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they gave him two kicks that left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what is amusing to attack for free a small defenseless animal which, moreover, was on a leash.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for his physical integrity, since an energumene who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, in the end, any person weaker than himself.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., on a Tuesday like any other, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog groaned all day.
We have of course filed a complaint with the police station of the neighborhood even if we doubt that it serves much and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to specify that the cowardly assassins were Spanish.
Indignation led us to denounce this fact.
We don’t understand what’s going on with young people so they find it amusing to abuse a helpless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and companionship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, helmet sets
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as indicated today by the two structures.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, since it is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin said the campaign is in line with its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products” and said it contributes to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new two-wheeled helmet promotion campaign, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, to ensure the widest possible circulation.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles up
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to figures from the employers' union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealers.
The good news, however, is that the benchmark for comparison in November 2008 was particularly poor, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound of last month, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, when all vehicles that fall into the light commercial vehicle category (passenger car derivatives, pickup trucks, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95,853 have been sold.
The large clouds that affect their demand the most have not dissipated, because although they are also bought by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions implied by the limitation of bank loans, other factors must be added such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
Given this situation and the difference between passenger vehicles, the purchase aid for the 2000E has been little used.
In addition to individuals, self-employed individuals and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions level that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) was reiterated.
The dealer association forecasts a year 2010 similar to the one that ends, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of passenger vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency Brake Assist is now mandatory
As has happened with the ABS brake anti-lock system and as will happen with the ESP stability control, emergency brake assist systems will be a mandatory feature on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a waiting period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the kick given by the driver.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study by car component manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident were unable to press the brake before the collision, and half of them did not take full advantage of its strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, back out, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is calculated that one in four disasters with injured people would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum force on the brakes in order to minimize damage.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragossa) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will be launched during the first week of April – probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude Opel’s rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends that each point of the plan has been approved beforehand by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will be submitted first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, is postponed until early 2010.
At GM, however, a decision on the sale of Saab is expected to be made in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, is growing in importance.
In case there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest and precious jewel, Porsche’s engineers started from the Boxster S and managed to slim it down from just under 80 kilos, leaving the scale at just 1,275 kilos.
This led them to do without, in the first place, the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual sheeted roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 15 other kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, 7 kilos of gained, to mount sports bins, still 12 kilos, and with light tires of 19 inches.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, gaining another six kilograms and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual-clutch PDK gearbox, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual gearbox model, mainly on roads in the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behavior can only be described as irreproachable.
The decrease in weight does not prevent the car from driving on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it’s been a long time since we tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees as much safety in turns, including at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles at low speed for the time needed, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
That's what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands on the steering wheel will indicate.
And she will do it with surgical precision.
Sound of motor at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either when stationary or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road surface we drove with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car handled the potholes well.
The electronic assistants barely showed up all the way, while on some turns we found ice in the early morning and gravel later in the morning.
In the end, an ultralight car, the most entertaining to drive and that is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
" Bag Girl "
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house's fashion shows, the singer displays her bad girl face with as much capacity as her Chanel bags.
More than a “Bad Girl” or an “It Girl”, it’s a “Bag Girl”.
Baskonia wins in Israel
Caja Laboral had a brilliant 91-82 triumph during his visit to the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous absences suffered by Dusko Ivanovic’s team, and she is thus at the top of her group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets with three points was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The Vitoria team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great dose of commitment and collective work, even if it had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points scored, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blues and reds, who took the lead from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, presaged that they had jumped on the Israeli ground with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was received with cheers and applause back at his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to be noticed as the best player on his team, with 13 points scored, although Splitter's "minus six" rating already hinted that tonight was not going to be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and the team of Avala wanted to remind the one of Vitoria that we do not win so easily on their pitch, and thanks to "the hand of Elias", they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellows taking the lead over the bright (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from dead, needed to chain some skillful actions to get in the air, and it was at this time that the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic appeared which, with three baskets to three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas put the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the locals succeeded in accentuating the quarter-final.
Avala's team went out to play it all for the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they would not tire of anyone taking from them what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for fouls, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis got closer in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped in Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Wounds prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to Olympiacos and gave him the head of group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not afraid of the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or the size of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter, made the Andalusians dream of an aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the domestic game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, helped to reverse the score 22-20, in the thirteenth minute, when an action, a beginning of a fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of both players.
The Greek team began to operate by showing their superiority in both sides, while the injury exit of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez weighed on Unicaja.
Domestic players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, widened the advantage 44-32, in the nineteenth minute.
An impossible climb
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos who, despite the 19 losses, showed themselves superior and even managed to match the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, making the head of the group stagger.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left a little hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But the win was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos was relentless when the players put pressure and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new app from Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of real estate classifieds, jobs and vehicles in Spain.
The “How much should you be paid?” tool calculates users’ salaries from more than 140,000 job offers Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For the past week that the app has been running, the search engine has detected that as a rule, the Spanish worker “feels poorly paid,” explained in a statement Trovit’s product manager, Albert Ribera.
According to data Trovit has from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros gross annually and a French one, 31,059, while a Spanish one receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34,247 euros gross annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of server, with 11,592 euros net annual, followed by that of seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the past three months have been as a driver, part-time jobs and social worker.
Brazil set a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The ousted president must abandon diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, Chargé d’Affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that “Mel” knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
“He is aware that he must leave on January 27, at the end of his mandate, he must look for another destination.”
The channel also quoted the former mandatary, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: “My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government,” Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you so much
After rosy days since last spring, during which asset inflation has been the dominant rating in the markets, uncertainty is again emerging, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future that is inherently uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at near-zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been virtually finalized and, without calling into question their non-conformist liquidity policy, are starting to put a little bit of sand in the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their one-year auction next week.
As a result, investors doubt the global economy’s ability to sustain an economic recovery without heterodox measures, and we are seeing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
There is once again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the havens chosen by investors, provoking an increase in the differences between eurozone countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a further downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral risk, who were trying again to provoke a case of conscience among those responsible for world economic policy who had curbed the destructive effects derived from credit limitation on the destruction of employment, while what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai looks like a tribal struggle between the emirs to return to power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot aux roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durao Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro zone country to fail to meet its commitments.
What makes sense, however, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we find ourselves facing an episode of transitional risk premium normalization, after a few excesses in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as long as our public debt spreads increase in line with European corporate bonds, we do not have to worry.
If European differences were to decrease and ours continued to increase, then this would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators force most study departments to anticipate their stimulus models and revise upwards their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which are back on track with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not bode well for their warning.
Again, this seems to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment "prudent is the mother of safety".
Connected sectors
Iberdrola's president, Ignacio Sanchez Galon, was the first to speak yesterday before the sub-committee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galon sketched for the press what he had mentioned in front of the sub-committee, eight-closed.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 million euros until 2020 and 60 000 million more between that date and 2030, in case the nuclear power plants currently in operation remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the question changes, and we will have to increase the power.
His bet focuses on both gas and coal-fired power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW more are needed, with other “supporting energies”.
Galon, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with what his company demands, did not want to attack the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to fight against global warming.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this direction, despite the "one-off" measures, as described by the president of Iberdrola.
In any case, Galon believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must begin to be made, as they take some time to mature and a stable income-generating framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling market at ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the role of preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for the services of goods, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcala de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Center.
The alliance expects an investment of 20 million until 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to conduct energy efficiency research on highways and airports.
Acciona competes for its first motorway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, a market in which it is already working as an energy company and water manager.
The project involved a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are his rivals.
A 5-kilometer-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and motorway concessionaire.
The city council wants to be able to dispose of it by the end of 2014.
After choosing the public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Ernst & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be in charge of the construction site and the operation of the toll.
Pending the presentation of their offers in May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros) and in the last phase there are three consortia, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in smooth, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground work.
Against the Acciona team, builds the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium to pass the test is LBRJV, whose capital is split between Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major construction projects and privatizations, but entering them represents a great difficulty, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has just won a place in this market by its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona is focusing on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a wide presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for erecting and managing the Adelaide desalinator, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and leverage synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the so-called Northern Link (northern link), will connect the Toowong Western Highway to the Kelvin Grove ring road (see map), through 4 kilometres of tunnel, the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the auction will take place in the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include twice two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide A$500 million (A$308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make a large profit from Hochtief, which yesterday mentioned getting a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The ACS-owned company will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the national fiber broadband network infrastructure.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have fast internet access and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has divested the 27-story King George Tower construction project in the city of Brisbane, the work has not yet begun and Hochtief has completed the sale for $129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC gets $64 million tunnel in Slovenia
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is being asked to build a 2.1-kilometer-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, for an amount of 64.5 million euros.
The company was awarded this contract a few days after being commissioned to expand the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in tunnel construction.
The construction is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Sra. Rushmore gets ad for Renfe
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, said the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was chosen from 16 agencies that ran for the tender organized by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Telecom fined $63 million to curb competition
The French competition regulator has fined France Telecom 63 million euros for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region owned by the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programs on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still a state enterprise, has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has also been increased because the authority that oversees competition considers that France Telecom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is therefore recidivist.
An app store
On the other hand, the mobile subsidiary of the French company followed in the wake of other operators and opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has netted 476.4 million for Real Madrid and Barça since its inception.
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since its inception in 1992.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, placing them in third and fifth place among the clubs that pocketed the most money in the competition.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for major clubs.
Indeed, the competition has allocated 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament's inception, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served in this split.
The white club was the third on the continent to receive the most money for its participation, and the only one, along with A.C. Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, current title holder and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they lost in front of the Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in terms of money earned by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by UEFA's complex money-splitting procedure.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend $413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification matches (among which Atlético de Madrid) received $2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, in addition to 550 000 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the round of 16 receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarter-finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive $4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million, and at most 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which are devoted 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the largest, and has four places.
The previous year's champion pocketed 40% of the money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other game will be paid based on the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group has listed yesterday the details of the offer to purchase shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not require him to launch a takeover bid (OPA) for all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, the shares of Sos ended at 1.85 euros; the offer of Nueva Rumasa therefore values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 councillors.
Jerez’s group gives shareholders 15 days to indicate their interest in selling the shares.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
If it were to take place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible takeover bids and judicial back-and-forths of her former directors, the Jesa brothers and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of Maria Luis Jordo as the director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a managerial position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal further embezzlement cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernandez Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the misappropriation of 212 million without knowing the destination.
The CNMV authorizes the OPA of exclusion of Paternina presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The watchdog explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with current standards and that it considered the contents of the explanatory sheet submitted "sufficient" following the amendments applied on December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of the share capital, composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been locked up, and that they could in no way be transferred before the finalization of the offer, the price of which he indicated had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the standards in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each claim is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex job.
Calculate by hand the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for claims assessment and maintenance are dedicated to gathering information from manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other competing companies in the area of assessment tools and industry information development are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velazquez, sales manager of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years, more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very difficult job, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image of each model is created on which the different parts of a passenger car can be clicked.
If it is a massively sold model, the job can be ready in a week if the process moves forward very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have for example information on Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghinis.
For vehicles on the road, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and development of databases, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Every year, Audatex invests $90 million to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer various products.
The most common application is repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of breakage parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
Given the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard claims assessment solution, for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes into account repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint scales.
This tool can be purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, at most ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows bidding on vehicles declared wrecked.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, carrying out geo-demographic analyses or knowing common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious claims for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer’s official parts, prices and times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for disaster, breakdown or car maintenance.
The GT Rating Guide is a historical reference product in the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the last three years, and it made a turnover of 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it began its internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and moved to Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on the stock exchange for $1,000 million, today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.

Last October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company’s capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimation and sales service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, scrapyards and professional sellers who must be registered before starting to carry out operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collectible cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex steps.
Garage quote in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are resistant to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are required.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, an actual graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables like labor price, markups, or discounts, and then they can print the quote to hand over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be subject to credit.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics are very happy to see, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and rotate it to see the inner face.
