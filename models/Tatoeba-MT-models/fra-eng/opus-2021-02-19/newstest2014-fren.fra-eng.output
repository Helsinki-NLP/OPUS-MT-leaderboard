Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped Thursday from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination with wings), it went up to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located at more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many bastards had gathered to observe its exploit.
A black box in your car?
While planners in the U.S. road network find it difficult to find the money to repair the decaying highway infrastructure, many are looking for a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches itself to the dashboard of your car.
The aircraft, which record all the miles travelled by a motorist and transmit the information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in the planning government offices to reshape the obsolete system of financing the main U.S. roads.
The generally uninteresting sector of major axis planning suddenly sparked a lively debate and turbulent alliances.
The libertarians have joined environmental groups to pressure the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly the road you are travelling on, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress cannot agree on whether to continue, several states have not waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles travelled.
Thousands of motorists have already embarked these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS surveillance system, for an experimental trip.
This is truly indispensable for our nation.
"It's not like we have a choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, General Manager of the Southern California Association of Governments, who predicts that the state will begin recording the miles travelled by each Californian motorist by 2025.
There's going to be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes paid by the Americans at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars can travel more than miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
"The gas tax is simply not tenable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed trackers on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
"This turns out to be the most logical long-term alternative," he said.
Wonks calls this from user fees to mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces urban liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state's ambitious laws on global warming.
But representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chair of the House of Representatives Transport Committee, said he also considered it the most viable long-term alternative.
Supporters of the Reason Foundation's free market also appreciate the idea of charging drivers per mile.
"It's not just a tax in a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President of Politics at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they receive.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transport Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to move towards payment by mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved approximately 10,000 cars.
But the Speaker of the House killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to their work or to the city.
Nevertheless, several States and major cities are making progress.
The most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the country's largest experience.
These motorists will soon pay the Crown kilometric fees instead of gas taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering one.
Illinois is testing a limited number of trucks.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the American east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their cars with a device, drivers were worried that the government could follow their every move.
"A concern about Big Brother and that kind of thing is a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads strategic performance management in the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
From the start of the trial, the Nevada ACLU warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged localization devices."
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily goings and comings.
Nevada is one of a few states that are now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car is travelling, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, added Khan, citizens will be more comfortable.
Researching this technology has led some state agencies to use a small start-up in California called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to assist motorists who pay taxes to states.
She was looking to break into the emerging auto insurance market, where drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices it tests have pleased the planners of the major axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't record their speed and locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director of True Mileage.
Big mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much cheaper ways and far less intrusive methods of doing so.
In Oregon, planners try the experiment by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide "driving payment" insurance, and create a real-time speed dataset from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Car drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers to them," said a document on urban development.
However, some transport planners are wondering whether the whole debate on mile payment is not just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say that Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing gas taxes.
A single or additional annual tax could be imposed on hybrid drivers and others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
"It is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when we simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, Director of Legislation and Public Affairs to the Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: four new listeners
The English musician has not finished surprise this year.
Starting from The Next Day, released in January, he has concocted a luxury re-edition scheduled for November 4, with several new releases.
Four have already emerged on the web.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone panicked.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he said that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dates from 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be counted on to sparkle the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke has planned to reissue this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks of the Deluxe edition, five specially unveiled songs for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
He introduces both each record, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and covers, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics...
And, above all, he gives a taste of his new Atomica title, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and well-controlled rock electricity.
New ones already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the Web.
The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a light cavalcade that slows down gradually to give way to a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John's Rocket Man or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would it come from another planet?
The bewitching guitar riffs make you want to leave the Earth.
Bowie has fun playing the chameleon with these titles: alternately informant, man aboard a rocket, Martian potential...
He hides and reveals at once, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
It is not surprising that he has a mask in his hand in the photograph of the campaign L'Invitation au Voyage, of the Louis Vuitton brand, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that injured soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was being followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured military personnel - who do not meet the "universal service" rule of the army requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for pension benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by La Presse Canadienne, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, was released from the military despite his request to remain for another year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after Corporal Glen Kirkland, who stated before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before being ready because he did not meet the universality of service rule.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that it was totally different than wanting to leave.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with La Presse Canadienne on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has been struggling to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks, but who are not fit for combat.
Under current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicate that of the 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required length of service to obtain pension benefits.
Liberal veteran spokesman Jim Karygiannis asked Wednesday for Corporal Hawkins to be reinstated, while NDP Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice."
Disney puts on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to favour tablets over its own TV channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24th on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on Disney Group channels is not expected until 2014, details the statement of its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, intended for children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of the pussy Callie, sheriff of a city in the American west where she makes order with a magic lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," said Albert Cheng, Vice President for Digital Products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the press release.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "expand the life of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms," he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 years of age have already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of children under 8 years of age, compared to 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. intelligence services, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he has the right to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter that the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts was obviously positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalise political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is charged with spying and stealing state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make this possible."
Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained by complaints that the NSA had tapped the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member of Parliament who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States," this should be taken advantage of.
Mr Ströbele, German Green MEP, published a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden was testifying in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be "safe" there, said the MP.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "serious and sustained" persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global reaction to “my act of political expression”.
Citizens from all over the world, as well as senior officials – including in the United States – considered the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance to be of public benefit.
The letter puts forward an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix video-on-demand service via their television in a future that does not seem so distant.
Cogeco's subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary testing of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to highlight more user-friendly interfaces and more options," explained Cogeco's President and CEO, Louis Audet, in an interview.
Cogeco Cable is thus following in the footsteps of its competitors, such as Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary does not yet have a specific date for this new platform.
"We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Mr. Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our clients currently do not have access to.
Rogers telecommunications giant has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, could be resolved.
In the United States, the popular video service claims to be in discussions with some major cable companies to make its service available through their broadcast platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in its Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for pay-per-view services.
"It's been about two and a half years since we said that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large chain packages doesn't work," said Mr. Audet.
He hoped, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would lead to interesting recommendations.
"There will have to be a new kind of frame of reference from these discussions to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television," said Cogeco's CEO.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and they are expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the results side, Cogeco reported a net profit of $43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¢ per share.
This is a decline from net earnings of $44.9 million, or 83¢ per share, for the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline by amortization costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired the US-based Atlantic Broadband cable company for $1.36 billion in 2012.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Entreprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for $526 million.
As for Cogeco's revenues, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are $1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, of the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable's revenues increased by 45% to reach 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the 2013 fiscal year, Cogeco Cable's number of customers is up 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried that the number of clients will fluctuate in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very strong competition.
Horse in beef products
Horse meat was detected in canned beef products, sold by two small UK retail chains at low prices, today announced the agency responsible for food hygiene.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA at a height of 1 to 5%.
"Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," explained the British agency.
A scandal about the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to reviews by the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four people early Friday on Highway 131 in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a motorist who was travelling in a northerly direction in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and struck a car that was coming in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic had returned to normal around 6:00 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers carrying carry-on baggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for carry-on baggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them as the aircraft descends.
The new hand luggage charges are for bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free of charge.
Frontier stated that it would charge $25 if the charges were paid in advance and $100 if the travellers only paid once at the boarding gate.
Frontier's spokesperson, Kate O'Malley, indicated that the $100 was intended to encourage travellers to pay the fees in advance.
"We don't want to charge this price," she explained.
Airlines started charging for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these charges put as much as they could in hand baggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no longer room in these compartments.
These charges are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said these new fees will not really be used to raise money.
It is a question of making the most loyal Frontier customers understand that it becomes increasingly difficult to find room in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase their tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
For example, a passenger queued at a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these charges before arriving at the door.
Frontier's carry-on baggage charges will not be applied until the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often blush about luggage and other expenses, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines charge enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, many of them did not pay the cost of baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first carry-on baggage charges three years ago, and low-cost Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant to airlines Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the charges in supplement.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated Spirit's carry-on baggage costs to be $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently travelled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the gate when passengers discovered the unusual carry-on baggage charges imposed by the company.
"I've never seen such a smooth boarding process in my entire professional career," he said.
I expected to see teeth gnashing and a fight at the door.
The aircraft was full, he added, "the passengers boarded at the speed of lightning."
Frontier also makes like Spirit and applies a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who take coffee can be tightened free of charge.
It will always distribute water free of charge.
US Airways briefly attempted to charge for drinks in 2008 but went back seven months after passengers complained and no other major airline followed.
Frontier's decision to charge for carry-on baggage when passengers do not buy their tickets directly from the airline is his last attempt to encourage customers to go to his site.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of using an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their tickets via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she reduced miles' bonuses by 25% on a trip.
For example, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would save 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly from Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in its home town, Denver, but its business is shrinking and it is losing money.
Revenues dropped by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to correct Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
NSA calls into question an "internal error" and not hackers for the breakdown of its site
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said on Friday that it was a bug that caused the breakdown of its public site for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update," the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the breakdown was due to a distributed denial of service attack [SDS] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson explained.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the breakdown of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactic is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly ultra-secret NSA, a time known as the "No Such Agency", has been under the spotlight and has been heavily criticized in recent months as a result of a wave of revelations about its extensive national and foreign communications monitoring programs – which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former disillusioned NSA consultant, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has led to many speculations that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
Delta Downtown now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta promises not to let down his employees.
Employers came to meet with employees directly on site, and employees were met individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains Regional Director of Labour Relations at Delta Hotels, Félix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta is taking place in a highly competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had choices to make.
Either he was reinvesting in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, Chair of Transat Tourism at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for seniors.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totalling nearly 600 rooms will emerge within two years.
For Titan's CEO, "Goodyear Amiens' buying project starts with zero employees"
Maurice Taylor, CEO of the U.S. tyre manufacturer Titan, declared today that he was ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 jobs in the plant after throwing the towel with a crash in January for the partial takeover of Amiens-Nord's Goodyear site.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister for Productive Recovery, had already announced this on Monday 21 October.
After giving up the plan to buy the plant in January, you come back today.
You had violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, "mad" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this volte-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr Montebourg is a charming young man who is trying to save some of the best paid industrial jobs.
If I hurt someone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries we work eight hours handicaps France.
In India, China and many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I don't have any prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has space to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But with a fair price and skilled workers, it is worth a try.
What kind of deal do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance pay, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine Titan buys the closed factory from Goodyear.
As a result, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other EU country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
But he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from among the approximately 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before he tries to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on severance benefits for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the plant.
Mr Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister was 333.
I know he'd like a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance benefits.
If all employees accept them, the plant's purchase plan starts with zero employees.
How can we provide guarantees of tenure when there are no employees left on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages to get the CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan to buy the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier's profit declines, while aircraft deliveries and orders decline
Bombardier Inc., a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and deliveries of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide in-flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft nor did it provide information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial commissioning schedule by September.
After the pilot's inaugural flight about a month and a half ago, the pilot flew only three times, and the question then arose as to whether the test phase was on track.
The results did not match the forecast and the share price fell by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, lowered his rating Thursday from "overperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential for the stock exchange to increase in the next quarter or two.
"Although the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed with the profit margin in the Transportation division," Cameron Doerksen said in a memo to customers.
We expect Bombardier to register new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program moves forward.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft has so far been modest at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's assertions about the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airliner.
At present, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments with 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and CEO, is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders prior to the commercial launch of the first aircraft.
Leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was moving forward in accordance with the schedule.
"The test aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than expected," said Mr. Beaudoin at a conference call, adding that ground testing and software updates were planned during the aircraft's downtime.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to make a first flight and to schedule an update period, and that's what we did.
This will happen again throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, while the others will follow shortly thereafter, said the company.
Yet analysts are skeptical that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that it is in the process of assessing the time frame for entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
"This slowness in flight testing – although apparently consistent with Bombardier's internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be delayed in the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net income dropped to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The adjusted share result remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues decreased slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a result of 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer in the world reported that it had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared to 57 aircraft a year earlier.
Net controls fell to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aerospace division was $32.9 billion as at September 30, an unchanged figure from December 31 of the previous year.
"In Aerospace, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing," said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aeronautics revenues fell 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the largest railway manufacturer in the world, reported that revenues from this division had increased by almost 11% to $2.1 billion.
The Transport division's order book totaled $32.6 billion as of September 30, a slight increase from December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport division have suffered from problems of execution concerning some large contracts.
Leaders announced that new indications would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's share price, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer of Google Inc, would be on the board of directors, dropped from 8.5 per cent to C$4.83 on Thursday afternoon.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third-largest aircraft manufacturer and the closest competitor to Bombardier, reported on Thursday a 10% decline in its quarterly earnings.
Two speleologists of 23 and 27 years of age had been missing in a gulf under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday evening, it was learned Friday from the Speleo rescue of Isère.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one seasoned to practice and the other not, had gone underground Thursday around 9:30 p.m. to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We had no news of them since then, said the same source.
"The speleologists should have come out at around 5am," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to the rescue team in charge of the relief organisation.
Dozens of people on the spot
About 20 rescuers, ten civilians from the French rescue service, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on hand.
In late afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but in good health in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th Battalion of the Alpine Hunters of Chambéry, were found "exhausted, but not wounded".
They got lost in the network, went back on their feet while waiting for help, specified the prefecture.
Refueled, they should come out of the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union called on its members on Thursday to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services in the wake of new revelations about the activities of US and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo's search engines and messaging until further notice," she says in a press release.
It considers the Washington Post information "scandalous", according to which the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected mass of information by infiltrating international networks that allow both companies to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union who claims 38,000 members.
Repainted lights: MP calls for Brigitte Grouwels to resign
Minister Brigitte Grouwels' project to "relift" the posts of traffic lights in Brussels is not popular with everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in the centre of Brussels a test project consisting of repainting 16 posts of traffic lights of the region in the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The aim being both "to increase security" and "the Brussels identity".
In the long run, the idea is to repaint all the Brussels traffic lights at an estimated cost of around EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to the Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content to spend madly the money of the Bruxellois in operations of relifting the signal posts in the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues his operations of Flemishization of the Capital", insurges M. De Bock in a press release.
After her yellow-mague-black taxis, she finally painted herself in dark-blue-black yellow the columns of Brussels.
According to the Member, there is now "no difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The people of Brussels deserve better than to see their money wasted by a CD&V minister who carries out the NVA program herself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
"For the record, Brigitte Grouwels was only elected with 2,245 votes, or 0.5% of Brusselsers!" concludes Mr De Bock.
the portico of Pont-de-Buis dismantled
The green portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which on Saturday a violent demonstration of opponents to this tax was held, was disassembled on Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived at the site shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national highway was diverted in the wake.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the prefecture of Finistère on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecocouv, manager of the portico.
This is the last of the three ecotax porticoes in the state of operation in the department of Finistère, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google's connected glasses.
They can acquire an earphone, a charger or a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a protective cover made of micro-fibres or an in-ear earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with corrective lenses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago, my father wiped himself out of the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I would continue to "follow it".
There is no recipe, no instructions for using to pass the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time was the strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat as I was driving.
Another time, a sweet awakening in the middle of the night to watch his watch that no longer leaves me, placed on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
That's at least what I thought the day I found his body empty, clenched on that bed of a hospital with crumpled sheets.
Similarly, his funeral was an icy farewell focused on the meagre glow of candles surrounding his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by little diurnal or nocturnal appearances, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she resumed her place in the landscape of my thought that was believed to be mourning.
And then, she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother's person in any way, but simply a woman I didn't really know, a woman who embodied that person during her stay in life.
In dying, this woman had perfected her life and released the person I loved, and here I found her, full and complete.
This detour from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved people never leave us.
I look like my father, "both inside and outside" seems.
I've always been told.
I never believed him back then.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he became old, sick.
Now I wasn't afraid of him anymore and I could love him.
One day he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I quit smoking, when I was scared, when I got hurt...
He was talking to me, constantly encouraging me, living in my body.
I could see his hands looking at mine, lend him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who said dead people aren't forgotten, they're invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I always feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life, makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I dream about them all the time, maybe not every night, but several times a week, that's for sure.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only, there is always something that prevents me from accomplishing this moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me on the contrary and fit into my story and actually, they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound where I had to know my baby's sex, I dreamed that I would wake up, get out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the landing and he smiled at me and rejoiced that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he shared with joy what was happening to me.
And of course, he was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and take pleasure in telling about this common memory lived after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year earlier, she was travelling with my family to Cuba.
That's the shock that his disappearance caused to the young bachelor I was at the time.
Nevertheless, I realized my mourning quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested me in the Middle East, to the point of making it a master's degree in a large school, were not, in retrospect, anodized choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and speak of Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she instilled in me are always present, so I sometimes think about how she would want me to act at some point.
The same is true of my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and uprightness of the one who was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes landing on me.
My mother died 19 years ago now.
Dead after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all the phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that triggers itself, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, moments incongruous.
Then time calmed down the pain.
Only the lack, the void without an answer, the need for her, to entrust me, to reassure me in the hollow of her sweetness.
Yet, she's here, silent presence, she's here and she's looking at me.
Every morning, I see her worried eyes landing on me, I see the dark circles that weigh her eyes down, the lines around the lips that are hollowed out by cigarettes, the folds that mark the forehead on days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at 43.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually rehearsed to smile, and uttering his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the hollow of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the morale is a bit reached.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the retreat of time makes us realize how much she was conductor and we try to stay in the path that she had set us.
If a being loved you very much, absence cannot take it out of your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 from asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted on what he thought or appreciated.
I couldn't attend her burial and three weeks after her death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my beliefs sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are consistent with his vision of things.
In fact, I have had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep and I always wonder what he'll think of it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, he will always be my reference.
It was kind of like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk between us.
Anyway, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It's almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6.
The immense pain that then invaded me lessened of course but it is still close to me.
Very often he "disembarks" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that when I wake up I am even sadder to see that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I told him no, he said "I'm going down" but in a voice so real that I woke up in a jump, anxious and I lit the bedlight looking everywhere, convinced that he was going to arrive.
I still live in the same house, and often I feel watched and turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In all the rooms I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I'm 58 years old, I've always lived alone since he left, he's and will remain the love of my life.
I want to make it clear that I am sociable with a responsible profession, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the bloodiest month since 2008
October has been the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
This Friday, Baghdad published official figures: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We don't tell the world to stand by and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," Al-Maliki said on Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not settled, it will expand, and what is happening in Syria will expand as well.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki spoke to the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution established by Congress.
Outside the building, demonstrators protested against the Iraqi leader.
They waved signs accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The Cocainoma lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed in the open.
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Liverpool Assize Court
A great defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug-related activities after having compromised because of his habit of using cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by criminals as a "major case", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police listening operations directed towards Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial related to drug trafficking.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32 years old, dropping three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a bar dinner with confreres.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and on her credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought unlawfully to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were monitored by the police at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire counties.
Together with 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for £1.5 million, as well as over £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, provided information to criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would be revealed.
Today, in Liverpool's Assize Court, Ditta, who works in Blackburn's Forbes Solicitors law firm, has fallen into disgrace after being convicted on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine in a previous hearing.
The fall of the lawyer occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing drugs, 60% pure, under the lawyer's trash cans in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the depot, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner party at the Ewood Park football stadium, home of the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer went home, discovered the drugs, and they called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this Class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and on her credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine. He stated that he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta collected his wallet and attempted to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that clients sometimes called him at home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that he was calling major players in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know that they should not violate the law, they are a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with particular clients.
The relationship we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He obstructed the investigation of the police as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored it.
He has been too close to some clients, particularly Scarborough, and has allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied anything illegal and said, "If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 3 o'clock, I would have done so immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police stated: "Mr.Ditta went from a criminal lawyer to a criminal himself when he began to obtain drugs from criminal organizations."
His addiction to cocaine has compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the ulterior motives of the leaders of organized criminal groups who tasked him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and build confidence with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this confidence and tried to hide behind the varnish of his profession.
The serious and organized crime unit in Lancashire conducted the investigation into Mr. Ditta, who was convicted of the three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstructing justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecute criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question-and-answer session about himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America, his last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be back on stage in December
Detroit News reports that the Queen of Soul will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board room of the MotorCity Casino hotel.
In November, Franklin recorded an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the illness she was suffering from, the famous interpreter of Respect told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she received were "difficult".
She claims to be "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lights
420 patterns, 2.2 kilometers of seashore covered with a coat of light: one could close the hot blow in Menton with the invoice of illuminations.
Invoice which, unlike many municipalities, is also regulated by taxpayers, not by trade associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses leds.
But also a differentiated management of the network of public lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
There was a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to the local police, there were at least two injuries.
This would be an employee of the United States Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the person responsible for the shooting.
The incident allegedly occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff rushed to the exits or to the tarmac.
The police quickly intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is being interrupted.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five saynetes imagined and performed by artists from the region, vignettes with a high dose of humour, teenagers are allowed to tame classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Society of Lyric Art of the Kingdom will come back with its Lyric Destinations, a formula that is now full room at the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists from the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the Lyric Apéro, the benefit concert held last August, with the help of the soprano colorature Marie-Ève Munger.
It was a profit-making activity, in parallel with the artistic dimension, and it helped the not-for-profit organization produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft to the ears as an air of The Bat.
Without giving precise figures, Yves Bergeron, Chairman of the Board of Directors, took advantage of yesterday's press meeting in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness of so many cultural institutions, the future is well underway, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
"The finances are afloat and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a stage we will pass in seven years," commented the administrator.
"I would even say beyond," added General Manager Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was accused of hostage-taking, kidnapping, threatening, carrying weapons for a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Paquet in a press release.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New application for class action against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new application for class action was filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults which this time took place at the Saint-Joseph oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The application is based on the testimony of the complainant, identified as "J. J"., who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, Brother Submissive, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the oratory of Saint Joseph, where he served as Mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was for only three institutions, and when the rules were announced, many people told us: "I was in such a place, can I register?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The special feature of the recently filed class action is that it allows complainants to be added to any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together complaints from 25 persons who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those referred to in the first appeal, as many of the affected establishments closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the Congregation of St. Croix and the Oratory of St. Joseph, which is a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse against children", that they "exercised moral, religious and psychological coercion on the victims", that they "were aware of the sexual abuse perpetrated and nevertheless suffocated them", and that they "sciently and consciously chose to ignore the problem".
These latter accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the Sainte-Croix brothers, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The class action must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once admissibility has been admitted by the Court, the second stage, namely the hearings on the merits, is carried out.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were held on the merits.
Major fire in a business
A fire seriously damaged a business in the borough of LaSalle, in Montreal, during the night of Thursday to Friday.
Rescue was called around 1:00 a.m. on Friday, due to a fire that had declared itself in the basement of an Indian restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
Thirty firefighters who were sent to the scene took almost an hour to control the fire.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said Montréal Fire Safety Chief Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on stage.
There were no injuries, but nearly 20 units on the first and second floors of this commercial space had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested because residents of one of the apartments may have to be accommodated temporarily, said SIM.
Much opposition to medical assistance in dying in the Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Congress on Palliative Care, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical assistance in dying in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay home, very few would like to end their lives, according to a spokesperson for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the focus was on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The president of the Réseau des soins palliatifs du Québec also rejects the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she deplores.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to Suzanne Fitzback, vice-president of the Alliance of Palliative Care Homes.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of Mathieu-Froment-Savoie House in Gatineau, felt that service would be unnecessary anyway.
They never ask us, "I want to die, give me an injection."
Rick Firth, Director of the Ontario Hospice Palliative Care Association, believes that Quebec's bill disorients the public about the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will follow suit.
For her part, Stéphanie Vallée, the Liberal Member of Parliament for Gatineau, said that the notion of end-of-life would have to be clarified before the bill was passed.
Kenyan press indignant at controversial media law
"It is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" said the newspaper, contesting the bill and asking that it be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extension of government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would undermine Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the Speaker will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and refer it to parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to have "control over the media." The Standard, for its part, said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had suffered a hard blow" and castigated the bill calling it "draconian."
The adoption of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists at the Westgate shopping centre last September.
The Kenyan media provoked the authorities' anger by broadcasting images of video surveillance cameras on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack allegedly stolen the luxury shopping centre.
The chief of police, David Kimaiyo, responded by summoning two journalists and a media officer to question them, although the summons was withdrawn following a shielding in the media.
Under the new bill, the media could face fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "deregistered" or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his or her fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations."
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animated blogosphere".
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist at The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Delivered to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering."
Kenyan legislators have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission in charge of wages and restored their shrewd wages of about 532,000 shillings per month tax-exempt – which are among the highest in the world.
A Difficult Year for Pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) in Laval caused a stir at the management of the Hôpital de la Cité-de-la-Santé during 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short-term departures, the pharmacy department was severely understaffed.
Almost 30% of the necessary staff were missing, making this fiscal year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
There was no use of troubleshooting, explained Ms. Beaudet.
Some of our activities within the institution have been streamlined or reduced to a level, as long as things go back.
We certainly worked hard to interest our young [pharmacists] so that they would come and stay here.
There was a competition of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 looks much easier for the CSSS pharmacy department.
Already, three pharmacists have returned to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to retain students were successful, as the four students currently in residence in Laval also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
Now it's much better, said the pharmacist.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
It will therefore fill our departures last year.
Continuing growing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or a predominance of young women in the trade, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is still precarious, because we have a young environment and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancy, we almost always drive on three maternity leave when it's okay, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and we don't have pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old top model doesn't start his career in cinema by the small door.
The director Lars von Trier chose her to play Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This pornographic drama is egregious, in eight chapters that will come out in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), erotic memories of a four-year-old who has been addicted to sex since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin's resemblance to her elder is striking: a twig silhouette, a diaphanous complexion and Franco-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to pose naked on iced paper will appear in much more sulphurous situations on large screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac made the temperature rise on the web: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he had recourse to X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies numerically: above the belt, it is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing her actresses into their last entrenchments, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her yet.
A room of the Narbonne CGR evacuated Thursday evening
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Méga CGR in Narbonne, as a precaution, as a result of throat tingling felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the facility manager had the room evacuated and alerted firefighters for a suspicious smell.
About 70 people came out of the session.
The people were examined and a full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on a tear gas?
Or involuntary incident?
Still, the management of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers in full.
The room was ventilated and everything got back in order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and customers regained the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She's trying to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkins.
Taking advantage of Halloween Day, a woman tried to get two kilos of cocaine hidden in pumpkins into the country on Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug could be detected.
The cocaine had been distributed in three pumpkins that had previously been emptied.
The drug was then transferred to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, CBSA spokesperson.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montréal-Trudeau airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1,653 drug seizures.
Air raid against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese Army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A shipment of short-range SA-8 ground-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new IDF air raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances similar to the one that took place on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting surface-sea Yakhont missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their irritation at seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet Republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's public debt securities goes to "B-", falling into the category of speculative investments.
It is accompanied by a negative perspective, with S&P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be lowered again within a year.
"It is becoming less and less likely that the government's strategy will ensure enough foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs," says the US agency.
The agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and anticipates that the trend will continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.
These reservations, which the authorities rely heavily on to support the local currency, hryvnia, are collapsing, and the agency increasingly considers a devaluation to be likely, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs cash to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of intense tension with its Russian neighbour, furious at Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, which is still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it to be 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, with a budget deficit, has been seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund for months, which in 2010 had granted it a credit of $15.3 billion and has so far released only $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country adopts unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, notably by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF noted this week that "significant external financing needs" were "vulnerability", while noting "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "no improvement can be expected in the short term".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year", with presidential elections scheduled for 2015, reports the expert, interviewed at the AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" associated with the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels is conditional on the release of opponent Yulia Tymoshenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be short- and medium-term negative consequences related to Russia's reaction," said S&P, who fears "trade restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukraine's exports, warned that if a free trade area is created between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen border controls for imported goods.
U.S. green light on the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday they received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the review period for the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the two groups announced in a press release.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the operation to be carried out.
"The merger is also conditional on obtaining further regulatory authorizations and the approval of the shareholders of both groups," they add.
Congolese army chases M23 rebels
On Thursday, the Congolese army (FARDC) announced that its units would hunt the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be about to be beaten after being driven out of the localities in the north-east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) which he had controlled since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurrection.
"We will prosecute M23 and acculate him wherever he hides because he is a criminal," FARDC spokesman Colonel Olivier Hamuli told Reuters.
We must not allow them to reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setbacks would not alter his demands for peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and M23.
There are clashes in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last settlement in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as in the vicinity of Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the government garrison's flight and the passivity of the Monusco peacekeepers.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of strength, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff has been reorganized and the army has gone on an offensive against M23, changing the course of the war.
The rate of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to be coming to an end," predicts Congolese business expert Jason Stearns on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historic - it would be the first time that the Kinshasa government has managed to defeat a major insurgency.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied with Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, which fiercely denies it, of militarily supporting the M23, which was originally formed by former mutinous Congolese soldiers.
British diplomatic leader William Hague invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office.
Last week Kigali raised the possibility of military reprisals following the shelling in Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entry of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived with the M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable that we would ever be liberated by the army," says one resident of this town bordering Uganda.
"We have lived in terror (of the M23), we are traumatized," added this man.
The tests carried out by the Institut Pasteur on a patient suspected of being infected with coronavirus have proved negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 are therefore the only two confirmed cases in France to date".
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient was suspected of being infected, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already caused about 50 deaths.
Chevron, the second largest oil company in the United States, reported on Friday a decline in its quarterly profit due to the decline in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining below the group's targets.
Its net income for the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged a profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company targets 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% increase in production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment spending has increased by $7 billion over two years and is expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Thus Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported on Thursday a declining net profit, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
Transportation of schoolchildren: the complaint deemed admissible
Since the beginning of the school year, the Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) has charged $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students on school transportation to two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is in a position to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contributions were requested.
"There is a mediation service proposed by the commission and I was interested," explains Ms Lefèvre.
In her view, CSRS was invited to mediation and requested additional time to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk about it, talk to each other and find solutions," Lefèvre says.
The Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) did not wish to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation is part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergency rooms of the Hotel-Dieu
Faced with the frond conducted for several months by some of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on 10 July to "decalate the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergencies which will not be able to intervene on 4 November".
An official request made "in order not to run any risk on the management of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but which also aimed not to hinder the campaign of the PS a few months from the municipalities.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Even if the term "transformation" or "change in continuity" is preferred to the APHP.
Starting on 4 November, firefighters who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency passes at the Hôtel-Dieu will all have been instructed to take thirty serious cases a day to the emergency centres of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, emergency interns will give way Monday to five general medical interns.
As for the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the current month.
"The emergency reception service of the Hôtel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4th", assures Loïc Capron, the president of the medical establishment commission (CME) of the APHP, who supports the project of the management.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to receive patients in emergency", he tempers, arguing that SMUR vehicles are permanently present on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will stay there, he also says.
But it is up to the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency reception service.
"Things are being done gradually," said Nicolas Péju, spokesperson for the ARS for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or we lied to him," says emergency doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Dismissed from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for having led the frond against the reorganization project, he defines himself as a "warning launcher" in the face of a "cynic" decision taken by "the medico-administrative technostructure".
"They're emptying and suffocating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he says.
For him, "if the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem".
Yet they are regularly engorged.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours waiting in the Lariboisière emergency room.
At the ARS, it is argued that 30 "dispatched" patients at several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources will also have been strengthened.
Both at the ARS and at the APHP, we defend the "new hospital model" already launched since 7 October and which should continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners are also expected to participate in the establishment of a "permanent ambulatory care".
"Where do we go if people are asked to self-diagnose," asks Gérald Kierzek for whom "the no serious emergency concept" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This is going to happen as for the level 3 maternity wards.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where there's the best care offer.
If the minister does not take any action by Monday, we will change the braquet, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Santé.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, UMP Paris advisor and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Parisian UMP were for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, candidate PS, again reminded France Inter Monday morning that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, she would clearly disagree, says Bruno Julliard, her spokesperson.
Even if the restructuring of the Hôtel-Dieu has its legitimacy in substance, we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to other hospitals.
Obama Stops Listening to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop its wiretapping of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, says an American official on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to regain control of the NSA wiretaps case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that the IMF and World Bank surveillance by the intelligence agency has been mentioned since the start of the scandal.
When asked about this, a US official replied: "The US does not conduct electronic surveillance of the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington."
Speaking anonymously, the official did not specify whether such monitoring had been put in place in the past.
Another official reported that Barack Obama had ordered that these practices be stopped in the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one that stopped listening to UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved Thursday a strengthening of controls over government oversight programs but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced further restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the retention of this information.
United Nations welcomes new poverty reduction goals
The United Nations will now begin to work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been established 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to "exceed national interests".
"I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These SDGs will build on the progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing at the same time as conflicts between powerful personalities break out
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
Concerned about her country's future, she exchanged her work clothes for a t-shirt marked "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd massed in the Independence Square of the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, almost every day there have been reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by Rhodesia ruled by whites and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall back into open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The stakes are significant for the growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal reserves in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale du Brazil, Eni d'Italie and Anadarko of the United States.
Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo reject each other's responsibility for tensions.
The Renamo states that the government was at the origin of the recent clashes and that it launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.
The assaults on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group leader, and Fernando Mazanga, the Renamo spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes the Renamo responsible for triggering the conflicts, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use "all the forces left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mr. Mazanga declared that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
"They are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are constantly fighting," explained Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer from the open university and specialist of Mozambique.
None of them knows how to negotiate well and none of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The proportion of votes won by Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, is expected to win more votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who is due to retire at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is not clear what the capacity of the Renamo is, but it has carried out disruptive flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
The Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that the people responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and that it is up to the president to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said that people only want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "lifestyle models," says the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that "the brute force does not weigh the weight in the face of subtle cunning", while the arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too violent, too scandalous and in some cases far too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland advocated "a careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's great that myths and folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are "overtly didactic" means that children "get out completely", messages being "sublimated" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything needs to be simplified or end well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a history rather than declared.
The known basis of what we show and don't say.
One fighter from Hamas' military-terrorist wing was killed tonight and another was wounded by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, which was learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they were shelled by an Israeli armoured vehicle.
NSA spying: the United States is "going too far," Kerry admits.
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in spying, acknowledged Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first confession of Washington in full controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time that an American government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in the NSA's interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I concede to you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this does not happen again in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London in which he participated from Washington on Thursday 31 October via video link.
In his retransmitted speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has at length justified intelligence and intelligence gathering practices through the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Referring to the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the American authorities had since foiled many plans for attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have in fact prevented planes from falling down, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these projects ahead of time," the US diplomatic boss argued.
And, said John Kerry to the Europeans, "I assure you that innocent people have not been deceived in this process."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far inappropriately," the Secretary of State admitted, who had already had to comment on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday night that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and that he was undertaking a review of these practices so that no one felt mistaken".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, citing documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, says that the program called "MUSCOLAR", and conducted with the British NSA counterpart, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to retrieve data from the optical fibers used by Internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected in January alone - ranging from metadata on e-mails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google denied any connection to these practices.
Over the last ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA has reportedly intercepted massively data and communications from allies in the United States and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the American president was not aware of such listenings, Barack Obama refused to speak on this subject, invoking national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied him that his intelligence agency had received tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even returned the bullet to the European intelligence services that would have seized these communications, before supplying them to the NSA.
This would concern "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and it would not be directed at Europe at all," said General Alexander.
And the controversy spread Friday to Asia.
Indonesia has convened the Australian Ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international spying network that has also sparked China's ire.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient Friday without its master asset, Swede Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the Ligue 1 club in a statement.
The PSG, the leader of the championship ahead of Monaco in contrast to the goals, released the list of players selected for this game of the 12th day, without the 32-year-old attacker.
The statement simply indicates that he is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
He nevertheless suffered from inflammation of the left knee on his return from selection at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the crematized deceased
The Crematorium du Père Lachaise organizes, at 11 o'clock, a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased crematized in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate at the Paris City Hall, is due to attend, and will then explain her proposals on funeral matters at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study carried out on 6 and 7 September among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a relative, the opposite is true: the French prefer burial (53% compared to 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book Death in Ash, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee on Funeral Ethics, emphasizes the "violence" of cremation for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a heap of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is due to the "effacement of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Protestant countries still not well lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," replied Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Apprivoiser la mort.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame it.
Approving cremation is for François Michaud-Nérard, general manager of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to plan for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that to which he would be entitled with a burial.
The annual survey of Ipsos shows a very strong attachment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their loved ones, whether religious (53%) or civil (24%).
From now on, 73% of those who have chosen a cremation wish to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also desire it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For about ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the ashes," says Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the establishments now offer masters of ceremonies, who carry out, in the presence of the body, the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to appoint the deceased, to connect him to others, to evoke him, to give meaning to his death, to organize farewell.
This has been the case at Père Lachaise's crematorium since 1998.
Masters of ceremonies are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the Crematorium du Père Lachaise organizes, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of remembrance, lay and non-religious, to which it invites the families of the people who were crematized in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online, to the attention of those who could not make the trip.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, the rehousing for rats turns to polemics
Earlier this week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the director of the Terres du Sud Habitat office, proposed, on an exceptional and temporary basis, to relocate the couple and their three children to a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
According to Joel Canapa, director of the office, the case has taken on excessive proportions.
Rats, there's always been rats in the cities.
The deratisation company carries out two passages a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, 64 interventions have been carried out.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and the rats do not grow in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, but for two rats, we are not going to kill a kid.
"We didn't invite the rats to our house," defends the father of the family who left his house to settle in the hotel.
We are soon without money and we expect a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo Stock Exchange Ends Down 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended up falling on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating suffered from the dollar's decline against the yen, detrimental to export values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix yielded 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony dropped by more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house preys on flames in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out on Friday noon in Old Quebec was quickly brought under control.
More than 30 firefighters were dispatched to 9 Hébert Street.
The flames broke out in a house of three dwellings spread over four floors behind the courtyard of the Séminaire de Québec.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was brought under control one hour after the firefighters arrived, many of whom intervened.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw some apparent smoke.
"Then there were successive alarms, because it took reinforcements to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck here," explained France Loiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec firefighters.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the audience, in the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it has been taken over more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of the headliners emerged in Carolines, and were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will feature the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of Stand Up for Heroes, a veterans' comedy and music evening at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, as has the world of comedy.
Many of the actors participating in this year's festival have gone through non-traditional circuits, such as shows on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance at the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel ("The League" on the theme of FXX's joyfully lascif fantasy football) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the show "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the casting of the series "Parks and Recreation", but she is better known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young actors with a singular voice (surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction factors of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up actor, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The appointment takes place at the Town Hall in central Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He was telling me that when he was here, sometimes he went down an alley between two buildings and said, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here."
The price of oil continues to fall and is close to $96 per barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about the size of stocks offset a report showing that China's electricity-intensive manufacturing sector is growing stronger.
The price of US reference crude oil for delivery in December fell from 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% drop for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on China's manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, showing growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8 per cent in the third quarter, after a decline that had not occurred in the previous two decades.
Brent crude, a reference for the international crude already used by American refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 per barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Challenge of the right to abortion in Texas
A Federal Court of Appeal in Texas reinstated certain restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This ruling means that a law adopted in July in that State, widely questioning the right to abortion, will be able to enter into force.
The decision of the Court of Appeal means that doctors who practice IVGs will have to have a "privilege of admission" at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a physician, by virtue of his or her status as a medical member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre for diagnosis or treatment.
Advocates of the IVG argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one third of state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "intake privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, almost 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a trial judge held on the eve of the coming into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But the Texas Attorney General, Republican Greg Abbott, who is running for governorship, has asked the Court of Appeal to quash the first-instance ruling blocking the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star achieved a strong return, on the audience side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% audience share.
But was the show at the rendezvous?
Some 10,000 candidates ran for the 10th season to face the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the perched André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
Past the excitement of regaining their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored on this first bonus.
As every year, the first audition shows mix a wide selection of budding singers, for better and sometimes for worse.
Now, on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some have found their account there.
Many of them tried the New Star, and sometimes even went all the way.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of successful singers are still there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make them laugh.
Court blocks decision on NYPD's control and search policy
On Thursday, a Federal Court of Appeal blocked a judge's decision demanding changes to the New York Police Department's screening and search program and dismissed the case.
The United States Court of Appeal (second circuit) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the city's appeal.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and interrogate citizens.
The City appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and training program.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the application for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be removed from the file because she violated the judges' code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she responded publicly to the court's criticisms.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black men of Hispanic origin as part of their monitoring and search program.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and has ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras on the body in the neighbourhoods where the greatest number of checks are carried out.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of persons whose cases are rejected after police control.
The hearing of the city's appeal is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This system of control and excavation has existed for decades in some form, but the number of controls recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 controls that mainly concerned black men of Hispanic origin.
A judicial action was brought in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
partisans advocating changes to the NYPD's monitoring and search program say they will put an end to unfair practices, allow for more effective and trusted police forces, and can change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say that these changes undermine the morale of the police without reducing crime, would be a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after the number of police officers has been severely reduced over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that she was not putting an end to the constitutional control and search practices, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Tenants must go to vote because each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of the accommodation that goes in taxes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each dwelling.
We are forced to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
By going to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to make a difference in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would attack the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to afford $100,000 fireworks, $4 million to $5 million in land in case...
Go vote, it's the best way to express yourself and say it's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entering the 500 m2 of the Elysée kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the way up to becoming a chef nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their holiday homes, and fed an incalculable number of the greats of this world in a near-anonymity that he only breaks today, at retirement time, at 60 years old.
The man with an open face, skull and intellectual glasses, born on October 24, 1953 at Ferté-Saint-Aubin, holds a CAP of pastry.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I have passed from one castle to another!", ironically Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manners of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the Head of State or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Ms Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen", to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
Don't mind heads of state who displayed a relative indifference to earthly foods, "they are all greedy," denounces Bernard Vaussion kindly.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a somewhat more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like".
The current Head of State, who regained the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no request for a specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially during the State dinners at the Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there were mistakes.
The now former chef of the kitchens of the Elysée, who had a drink Tuesday evening with his team, his family and friends, leaves with a pinch in the heart."François Hollande came to greet me".
He said eulogy.
"His human side has come out," he says.
The chef will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who for his part has been at the Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-unit building, located at 15 Hébert Street, was the subject of three alarms from the fire department.
The fire broke out in the front, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid response of firefighters prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where the buildings are built in close proximity.
The burning house housed four units, but no tenants were on site at the time of the fire.
The damage was quite limited, even though the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the origin, but the sappers have ruled out the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wall Street Wolf: exit of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets escape some images of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is embodied by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will undo you in his role as a crazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "long island stockbroker who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a major corruption case on Wall Street."
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort mounted a scam that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow its incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, men chain parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excess of any kind are the key words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have recovered the magic that had united them on Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long installation.
It looks like the movie lasts 2:45.
On December 25th, he will be able to take part in the Oscar race.
Coulson used the phone hack to check a pipe.
Former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson reportedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a bogus tip on an affair involving the then-in-office Minister of the Interior, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his "beautiful special advisor."
It was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, with hacking Pawlby's voice mail and "stomping permanently in front of his door," but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now NotW's editor-in-chief, is not the kind of man to stay in front of people's house hoping to surprise them, it's the kind of man to like to introduce the story to people to see what they say about it," said Mr. Edis.
He stated that NotW used three means to investigate the issues: telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, the monitoring, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says otherwise, but we say, "Of course we do."
Rumours about an affair involving Clarke were picked up first by NotW's editorial office when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said that she had been told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A tape, on which pirated voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private investigator's computer involving Ms. Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the time the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup have supervised the monitoring of Ms. Pawlby's every move.
In a voice message he left to him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he was seeing co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having carried out telephone hacking.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, in the midst of violence
The U.S. President was expected to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, in search of United States assistance to combat the strongest wave of violence in the past five years.
In October, Iraq experienced its deadliest month in five and a half years, according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday, 1 November.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations accounts for even more than 979 deaths and 1,902 injuries.
The violence is increasingly deadly despite intensified security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shia-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total number of deaths in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of American troops, the level of violence raised fears of a further burning while neighbouring Syria was in the throes of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot dead in the middle of the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of political marginalization and unjust arrests, has contributed to this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five car bombs north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunnite extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
The violence is at the centre of talks in the United States with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the American president, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had drawn an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival on Wednesday in Washington, Nouri Al Maliki has increased meetings with the executive and Congressional elected officials.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But they also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, who attributed her partial responsibility for the resumption of violence through her "sectarian and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make Nouri Al Maliki understand that "Iran's pernicious influence in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
Beijing accuses Uighur group of Tiananmen attack
On Friday, the head of Chinese internal security accused a group of Uighur separatists in Xinjiang of being behind the car bomb attack that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, ran into the crowd that was in the famous square of the Chinese capital, symbol of the deadly repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of internal security issues, accused the East Turkestan Islamic movement of being the instigator of this attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority based in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province Eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there driven by independentist demands.
"The violent terrorist incident in Beijing was organized and premeditated," Meng told the Hong Kong channel Phoenix TV.
"The group behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan," he added, as his remarks were taken up by the new China agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he is of Uighur origin and specified that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained gas-filled containers and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican probes on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major survey around the world on how parishes manage sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national conference of bishops, with the instruction to get as many answers as possible.
The information will be used for an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper from the United States.
A spokesman for the Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide on the appropriate way to probe the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
Democratic Republic of the Congo: Army attacks last rebel fief
The indomitables of the M23, some hundreds of combatants, were cut off at an altitude of almost 2,000 metres on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two localities about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It has not stopped since this morning, fighting continues despite the night," told the AFP a resident of Jomba, who was reached by telephone around 12:30, and according to whom a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed the rebels back a little."
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" in Jomba before going up to the front for a "sweeping operation".
There was very clear evidence behind him of crackling with small arms and light weapons.
From Bunagana, a political fief and the last stronghold of the rebellion that had fallen on Wednesday, a journalist from AFP could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the fighting entered "in a final phase", FARDC having "circulated the residual M23 positions to dislodge them".
Since the resumption on Friday of clashes between the 23 March Movement (M23) and the army, the Monusco does not participate directly in the fighting, but it provides decisive intelligence, observation and planning support to government troops.
At the end of the afternoon, dozens of soldiers, well stocked with ammunition, were climbing towards the front line.
They were armed with kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road to Bunagana, border post with Uganda, military personnel with civilian assistance were loading a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, to take over another machine shelling the M23 positions on the hills.
The Congolese President, Joseph Kabila, once again called on the rebels to "demobilize voluntarily" or be disarmed "by force", but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December without a result for the time being.
On the spot, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, only Ugandan mediation has to organise the signature," said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed on the government side.
The M23 was born from a mutiny in April 2012 of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, who were integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23, which Kigali and Kampala refute.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its subsoil is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday, according to the United Nations, the return movement to the Democratic Republic of the Congo that had started in the morning reversed in the middle of the day.
"This morning we went back to our fields, but the military told us to retreat," told AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by nine children, including an infant on her back.
There's a feeling that the shots are getting closer to the people.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical, that beast of the stage
Classic, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, sung and dance productions take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally found its voice.
It's a revolution: the French-style music is asserting itself as a genre of success.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart's opera rock, most attempts would get bogged down in ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Misérables bore the aureole of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the game.
Today, these two scenes handle titles like hit tubes.
The first one takes over this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following the world premiere of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "La Belle et la Bête" may well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other stages, musical performances such as "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are in tune with success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Historys of musicals" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyses the reasons for the success so hard won.
How do French musicals evolve?
The offer has increased.
First there are the "musical shows" that evolve according to the producers...
Some use beautiful screenshots and a real story as in 1789, Les Amants de la Bastille.
Others make a fifteen-year jump back on the pretext that you can serve about anything when you have Matt Pokora in the lead.
Then we have the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that bring us back the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musicals of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Kiss of Spider Woman" or "The Awakening of Spring" have difficulty in being funded.
Do we have enough capable artists like Broadway singer, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in one season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of musicals, it's very different.
Young people are trained in these occupations in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The talent pool is as consistent as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often boulevard theatre intended for adults and not for young adults.
Musical performances fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Offering beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of a craze of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are well kept by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a province Zenith.
Mayonnaise went up to Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the big rooms in France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver in the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury, on Friday morning at around 5:30 a.m., in the inner ring of Brussels near Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is unharmed.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00 a.m. at the accident site, while the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not result in any traffic jams as the accident occurred at the Hoeilaart exit.
Traffic could therefore be diverted by this exit/inlet of the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was seriously injured as a result of an accident at an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged, but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat from the attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: Army prepares new assault
Children play on a charred armour that belonged to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on 31 October 2013, in eastern DRC.
On Friday, the Congolese army was preparing for a new assault against the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The objective is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took Bugina Hill, which overlooks Mbuzi Hill.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by herself.
Only the hill of Runyonyi will remain.
"Celle de Chanzu is not very strategic," the governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku, told the AFP.
Mr. Paluku is planning to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fiefdom and the last stronghold of the rebellion, this locality is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was taken over on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred indomitables of the M23 have been cut off at an altitude of almost 2,000 meters on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who reported close fighting on Thursday throughout the day indicated that the situation was "quiet since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting the day before and buried.
One girl was shot and three other people were injured, one of whom was seriously evacuated by FARDC, added the witness called by AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have not recorded any loss of life.
NSA revelations increase companies' paranoia with regard to state surveillance
On a beautiful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew at low altitude over the British Consulate of Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
By order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explain that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of wiretaps and that the operation led to an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, Director of U.S. Intelligence Services, again stressed in September that the U.S. does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who became a whistleblower, began to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information about the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the manager on word.
Reports, according to which the U.S. National Security Agency spyed on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever sparked business paranoia towards state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that spilled over the vase.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence agencies and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data should be used for their mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," says Oliver Grün, President of ILOMi, who represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the US represents as much a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY.
However, in all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has passed on industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed their concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
"This is not the right way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn't let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal to cars to farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
However, the scale and sophistication of the US spy agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations has been a shock to some companies that previously thought that China posed the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing, as European officials have become aware that data held in the United States is governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, some 10% of non-US members have abandoned their plans to use an American cloud storage service provider after disclosures about the American Prism data exploration program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: "Our clients are asking us a question they weren't asking us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been some.
"This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the context of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Managing Director of the BASF chemical producer.
The Americans are spying on us both commercially and industrially, just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to reveal the prevention measures they have put in place, in case it leaves the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long been hammering the message that it is at least imprudent to get a free USB flash drive at a trade show or to leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the board of directors of the Audi car manufacturer, says that the collection of mobile phones before board meetings, so that they can not be used as remote listening devices, has been common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its managers to consider using simple mobile phones prepaid on their trips abroad because of the risk of harming the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access," the BfV warns in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies to economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty in the second degree of having carried out acts of piracy of economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a well-known German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former French director of internal intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: "Services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
The parents of a teenage boy from Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, believe that their son was murdered
The parents of a teenage boy from Georgia, whose body was found in a rug rolled in his high school gymnasium, think their son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 stuck in a carpet standing behind the stands of his high school gymnasium.
The sheriff's investigators in Lowndes County concluded that Johnson had died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old's family disagreed with these findings.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, counsel for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
"They think it defies all logic, the laws of physics and the common sense," added Crump.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been given for the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a briefcase and were returned to them in a body bag," he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several important questions remained unanswered.
What's the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis" to open a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from "positional asphyxia."
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"A number of questions still need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers evidence that would justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the sheriff's office in Lowndes County was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a South Georgia judge ordered the authorities to hand over all video surveillance footage that the investigators had examined.
The adolescent's parents stated that they hoped that the video footage contained clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on allergies in children for schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines that the U.S. government publishes, as the number of school-age children with food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to educate faculty and staff about food allergies in children, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine – the EpiPen brand self-injector being the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in case of life-threatening anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently updated the regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I feel like something stings my tongue," "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue," or "I have tingling on my tongue."
NSA case highlights total lack of intelligence debate
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand offends itself in public by summoning the ambassador of the United States on 21 October, and on the other hand forbids the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumour of the presence on its board Edward Snowden?
In my view, there are two levels of response on the part of the French Government.
When François Hollande telephones Barack Obama or when the foreign minister Laurent Fabius summons the ambassador of the United States, they react to a real discovery, which is that of the extent of American surveillance on all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart on the one hand the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the listenings of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't there be a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy of political and other issues around the world, we consider that, in the eyes of American power, this is an important light.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means to outrage us with this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA concerning terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American collaboration?
The implementation for roughly ten years of very powerful interception technology tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States in particular have established almost daily procedures for cooperation and exchange of information, which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, Mohammed Merah's presence in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through NSA resources.
France can be led, for example, to transmit whole blocks of data on the Sahel region to the US services, and, in return - as has already been said - Americans can give information to the French about other regions of the world.
So the substantive issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to acquire interception tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, especially in Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be their own, and ultimately the question of breaches of freedoms.
What is the real risk of the United States? a deterioration of its image?
I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk to the Americans can be twofold.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest summit of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case for Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to American providers subject to American laws, and thus to the control of the NSA.
The last element: the vast movement of revelations by media from around the world, which helps to trigger a debate on the surveillance practices of intelligence services hitherto almost non-existent, could lead legislators, including the United States, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children may choose "undetermined sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of the newborns will no longer be rigidly attributed to the birth.
Under the new Act, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to register a sex "undetermined" or "unspecified" on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions about sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex persons.
According to the BBC, an intersex person said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors created, bruised and swept away.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, the intersexuality being part of the group of about sixty diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term referring to persons having chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) atypical or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to attribute it, then to wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York City and a sexual identification specialist, said the new German law "seems to be a good idea."
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious illnesses that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without operation, and see how identity develops.
The science of knowing how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as either.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual traits (such as muscle mass, hairiness, chest and stature), primary sexual traits (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young boys of non-compliant gender now have special camps for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "neutral" after winning her appeal trial that allowed her to keep an "unspecified" sex for life.
The German passports will have a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators in this land, which is fundamentally Catholic, signed a petition for the removal of "gender theory" from school books.
The American website Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, we are reversing two other pillars of civilization."
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also stated on Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be attributed to babies at birth.
"The role of parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know your child's gender," she said on the young parents' website.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the beautiful Greek god who had a double sex.
And barely a decade ago, the medical community considered the gender as a slate, which can be erased and redrawn.
But from now on, many are questioning the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignment as he grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, the psychiatrist was not called, and the surgeon was called.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was initiated by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be malleable.
He stated the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories were controversial.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a sloppy circumcision to castrate him completely, also removing the testicles, and raising him like a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn't," Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher stated that some physicians "always repeat this model."
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex-change operations say "[that] they are not satisfied with the result."
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors could not really say if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised like a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
When he was 18, he had a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he found horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDD) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, taking testosterone treatment and getting his breasts removed.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based non-profit organization Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law "invites labelling and stigmatization."
"Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their child a "undetermined" sex," she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized as third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal genre," she added.
German law deals with the attribution of sex at birth.
It is not a battle that young children should lead at that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter suffers from a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that German law "will empower" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because of the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed feminine characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, 29 years old, Katie is married and an intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
"The law gives parents some latitude so that they don't have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
This allows them time to do certain tests and understand them, and a delay before registering "male" or "female".
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don't have to rush for surgery that's irreversible.
"This puts children at the heart of the decision and alleviates the sense of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid that they will not do what is right," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/she feels most comfortable with – and it is something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself or herself.
Letta confident in the longevity of her government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta judges that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition as the Senate votes to withdraw Silvio Berlusconi from his mandate.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the centre-left leader said he "firmly intends" to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax evasion in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where it has more opponents than supporters, pronounces its dismissal.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on 2 October by his refusal to yield to the injunctions of Berlusconi who already wished to bring down the cabinet.
L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transportation Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of gunfire.
Firefighters called to the scene of the drama claimed to have responded to a call for "multiple injuries".
"The police are on the spot," says the airport on its Twitter account, while television footage showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesman for the US Transport Security Agency (TSA) told the AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a stretcher, and a second one carried on a wheelchair.
The incident occurred at approximately 9:30 a.m. local (12:30 a.m. in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that Teminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The ASD spokesperson was unable to confirm immediately whether one of his employees was injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport were suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas operative in Gaza-sces
Israeli tank fire killed an Islamist Palestinian activist from Hamas on Thursday and seriously injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, according to reports from health-care sources.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in this area, as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli army merely evoked a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called a "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign regarded as dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers to President Barack Obama have considered, secretly, replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event that appears in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's highly awaited 2012 campaign book, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times got a copy of the book to be published and told Thursday night that the president's close collaborators had conducted "in-depth group work and polls at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's eviction could help Obama with his re-election as his hopes diminished.
According to the Political Correspondent of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House Secretary General Bill Daley, to measure how the replacement of the Vice-President by former Secretary of State Clinton could affect the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been staunchly kept within the Chicago Field Headquarters and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's close advisers – including Daley, Obama's former campaign leader Jim Messina and former White House councillors David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was under consideration.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal ties", before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said I'd looked at a whole series of questions, and that was one of them," Daley told the newspaper.
Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so we thought, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley described the exam as "cooperative," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would be beneficial in the election.
"The campaigns don't spend a lot of money on surveys and focus groups unless they seriously consider taking action," Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was reviewing the replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss then knew about the possible reshuffle.
Although Daley said he did not think that the president "was aware" of the possible change, the former secretary general admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not definitively answer the question of whether the political polls had arrived on Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden's eviction from the presidential list was being examined.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
Do you want a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world's first jellyfish-based fluorescent ice cream.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since ice cream starts to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more licks you lick, the more shiny it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", said: "It's something incredible but we're still at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about £200."
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts to shine.
We tested it in the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've created because jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about £140.
But it tastes pretty good!
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice cream flavours such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But its next creation looks even more ambitious.
He added: "I would really like to develop an invisible ice."
This is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to do it.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
The singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, revealed on Thursday his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for the residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, as he looked at the trees and made the famous 21st tai chi movement, with his hands as a musician who split the air," writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was master tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised her husband the week before her death to get him out of the hospital and take him to their house in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we're city dwellers, it's our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of living he had," she adds.
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more pincer.
Over the past two years, I have not distributed a single candy and I will certainly not do it any more this year.
But the stats show that I'm the gallant sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion in candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is trends.
Costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are all the rage.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, burgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that men from Daft Punk's space will be featured in our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no harm in staying traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my astonishment, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans are going to spend $330 million in animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of curious dogs disguised as hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, you don't drowsy.
The Americans are going to spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
That's great news for the 41 million kids who go hunting candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, don't tell us stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion grains of maize.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and this includes these amazing pictures of you pissing on them that your friends put on Facebook and that you can't remove and on which a guy you like leaves a comment of the "beautiful head" style.
Well, let's talk pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and sculpting a pumpkin in the shape of a lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – it's something we've been doing since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the "baby pumpkin trend" only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these pots and didn't have to sit in them.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million in pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The creepy pumpkins that slowly wilt on your home porch probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you're looking to get more notice, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try sculpting their 922 kg pumpkin.
Royal Bank of Scotland will in-house create a bad bank with 38 billion pounds (€45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to ease its relationship with London and speed up its re-privatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of doubtful assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned up the balance sheet within three years.
RBS also stated that it would enter a provision for depreciation of additional bad debts of £4 to £4.5 billion over the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free up from 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thereby strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would make it possible to draw a line on the past, the government having in particular been accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and the UK," Ross McEwan, new Managing Director, told the press.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior features bucket seats and 6-point harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, a service that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between events.
Bowler's CEO Drew Bowler said: "The rally fans joining Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced, some seek excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try out different forms of rallies in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of the raids.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is going to be really exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornice in a quarry
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, had escaped after a no-gravity road accident.
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry.
Firefighters came down as a reminder along the cliff to pick up the bitch and save her from a certain death.
A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after the firefighters were called to recover it safely while he was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable projection of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a career on Wednesday.
Its owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Department.
They had desperately searched for their lost bitch and made a call to social media sites after she disappeared in the career following an accident without gravity.
Around 2:15 p.m. Wednesday, a sharp-sighted person walking his dog spotted Ruby on a cornice in the quarry, stuck 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station rushed to the scene and came down as a reminder to save Ruby using an animal stretcher to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical Relief Specialist Andy Clayton said: "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She did not move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate biscuits afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical Rescue Specialist Peter Lau said: "Ruby was very lucky to get out of it unharmed."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for check; his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified when I watched the rescue."
I didn't think she was up there first.
It was surprising to have him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and fainted, she would probably have fallen.
Firefighters were amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely wonderful.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid that she would fall but she did not move."
Firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never dredged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "he draped me when I was 18."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very nice."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger stated that he " categorically denies having made advances to Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Perhaps she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, « Prism », landed in the first place of the charts this week.
Beijing calls into question a Turkmen Islamic movement
"Backstage support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia," said the head of Chinese security agencies to a Hong Kong TV channel, according to a video posted on a website on Thursday evening.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Political Bureau, spoke in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a particular organization after the attack on Monday.
According to the Chinese police, three Uyghurs from the same family in the predominantly Muslim Xinjiang region, bordering several Central Asian countries, threw their car loaded with gas cans at the entrance to the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that left two dead and 40 wounded.
The driver of the car, his wife and mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, which claims to be fighting for the independence of Eastern Turkestan, a former Chinese Xinjiang, was classified by the United Nations in 2002 as a member organization of Al-Qaeda.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disturbances in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The Breakup of Europe Gives Scots a Choice · Global Voices
Another day, another worrying history of independence.
This time, we are being warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European free movement zone in order to be able to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wires along the Hadrian wall.
Although Strathclyde's newspaper pointed to the possible economic consequences of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the headlines (and it was to be expected).
Neither did anyone say that EU Member States spend much of their time circumventing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continued non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from Scots.
So it's a story that's not one.
And a story so old that it is now frozen: I heard for the first time the boobard that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
Yet one has forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why exchange the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the major post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at a standstill.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe officially died.
Throughout Europe, parties that oppose the EU or campaign for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the alternative eurosceptic party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the September federal elections and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has been a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the carcan burdening national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many people to believe that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments with excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has put on its members favourable exchange rates for German exporters – something German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe find themselves with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise linked to productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidise French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a staggering cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Not all wage freezes in the world will prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt is rumbling, particularly in France, one of the leading leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy struggling.
As a result, Marine Le Pen's far-right party, the National Anti-European Front, has just won a crucial by-election, sending the socialists back to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split of the right will automatically favour the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with his new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create a single anti-currency and anti-European bloc in the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties are well represented in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-currency feeling unique in Europe will unite and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like the free "Europe of Nations (sovereigns)" favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will look soft in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of little England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels for a walk.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a freer European agreement if we kept our own motto.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – and it should be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour Exchequer, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent Conservative/Liberal-Democrat coalition.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Growing older earlier
Studies show that African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter's breasts and pubic hair start growing at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr.Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young American women and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassurance to parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid shift towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as the budding of the breasts, hairs under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first period in the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, compared to three quarters in 1970.
"Once the chest has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual appearance of puberty, but it is considered "early" when the development of the chest is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution may justify tests performed by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
Treatments are available to delay the onset of the first period and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on child age, development rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with drugs but recognizes that "controlling puberty can alleviate certain behavioural problems and the feeling for girls to be different from others."
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their period.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will deal with hygiene issues," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period at the age of 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about the rules, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public's attention about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz states that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study of girls aged 6 to 9 years who linked the percentage of fat to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their face and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians attending the PAA conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
Acne and pubic hair are common, even in infants and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the real appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to speak with their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early need to be reassured that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The tribute to the folk of the Coen brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémathèque française, had won the Palme d'or in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Without being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen set their sights on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the global pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich beauties in "Gatsby the Beautiful" for less glamorous clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the swearing out at the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" recounts over a week the tribulations of a folk singer who can't break through and gets angry with the whole earth.
He accepts backwards replacements at a raised foot in the studios.
Without accommodation, he makes the tour of the sofas of his friends who still want to receive it.
A documentary air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not careerist but integrity, with self-destructive behavior," Ethan Coen told the press, crowned with his brother Joel with several Oscars and awards in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis didn't exist, the two folk music fans built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this neighborhood of New York called to become "the epicentre of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as writes journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes on documentary appearances, from the dusty music label invaded by 33T unsold inhabited by an old unsold secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafés where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by integrating a strange character who constantly crosses the film: a magnificent red cat with a crisp look, companion of fortune of Llewyn Davis.
Asked about how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled that he had "grown up in Tennessee, bathed by blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is needed to "be considered good", "random can also launch someone's career", and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to be caught by anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves".
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", died.
He'll never know the word retirement.
Gérard de Villiers, who passed away on Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times dedicated him as "the author of spy novels who knew too much."
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theatre of the 198th and 199th opus of the famous series of spy novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was moving on this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published each year, Gérard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, was unaware of the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"Undoubtedly between 120 and 150 million all countries together," he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment in a building on Avenue Foch just steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which SAS adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Not counting pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books on the coffee table between the bronzes or ivorys reported from the 130 surveyed countries to situate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with a picture of a young woman with a advantageous chest, carrying a pistol or an assault rifle.
Inside, his serene altesse (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, an Austrian aristocrat who was disagent and a contractual agent of the CIA to pay for the repairs to the family castle, launched himself after all the wicked of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, then jihadists from the 90s onwards.
With each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never had the pretence of being a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people I don't send messages to.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, the Albert London type, who went there and came back with real and long investigations."
SAS' father said "do some kind of geopolitical soap opera."
"I am constantly following my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of the AFP, diplomats, people of the services that I know for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premonitors: for example, a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command centre killed several high-ranking officials, he had told the story in "Le Chemin de Damas".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Cairo Conspiracy", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he recounted the columns of 4X4 jihadists who founded on the Malian capital.
I am not guessing, Gérard de Villiers defended himself, I simply make assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions are realized.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 IBM daisy typewriter "whose pieces have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to the pen.
On the walls of his office are hanged assault rifles AK-47, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Gérard de Villiers was regularly pinned for machinism by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, and dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always well received in Africa where I have many readers.
Gérard de Villiers had said it: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is no age".
He won't die or retire.
No more than I do.
Aviators quarrel about seat width while large controls are at stake
The dispute is raging between the major aircraft manufacturers about the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Air Show which is taking place this month.
The conflict concerns the width of seats proposed on long-haul flights for economy-class passengers – who are not always the most courted by airlines, but to which the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but its big American rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as the aircraft manufacturers sought to sell even larger versions of their long-haul twin-engine aircraft, hoping eventually for a record number of orders at the event that will take place from November 17 to 21.
The manner in which the seats will be placed at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the "mini-jumbo" segment.
Boeing states that its redesigned "777X" will accommodate 406 people in economy class in seats more than 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus states that the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
The aeronautics giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X should take over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We have recently seen what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept that?"
" Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than regional turboprops," said John Leahy, Commercial Director of Airbus.
As eating habits change, people grow, but seats in airplanes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing Jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American weight from 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average size of the 21st century American is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival clings to a concept of seat dating back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly-named jet set was narrower.
Airbus added that it commissioned a study that indicated that an additional inch in seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing contests Airbus's figures regarding seat width and asserts that it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also said that the study shows that the cabin experience does not depend solely on the width of the seats.
"It's really about providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their business," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more a matter of having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute lies a race to control aircraft for an estimated amount of at least $700 billion at market price in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first pointed out in July, seat configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim seat-per-seat performance in their latest long-haul twin-engine models 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's announced performance depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in unit costs is small compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
" Boeing is doing this to be able to set up more seats and make its aircraft more competitive with our products," said Kevin Keniston, director of Comfort Passenger at the European Airbus aircraft manufacturer.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favour of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper rates.
"A seat width of 18 inches would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus' proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777," said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Aircraft vendors who travel around the world even take with them a meter to check competing configurations.
While venturing to offer comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus highlighted the need for greater cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern large aircraft, the experts say that it is unlikely that his call to the aviation industry to set a size standard for seats will succeed, but that it could make it forget the wave of sales of 777X.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the compensation proposal for founder and general manager Larry Ellison, in view of the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding but comes to tarnish the image of Larry Ellison, the third fortune in the world just abhorred by the victory of his boat at the America Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group that he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had had a negative vote on his salary.
Oracle's boss gave up a $1.2 million bonus for the fiscal year 2013 ended in May due to the group's poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but it collected about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is just a symbolic dollar.
Over the 2013 offset year as a whole, Oracle's net profit increased by 3.5% while the stock market price jumped by 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index which took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotin vaccine could suppress the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
Only one dose of the vaccine has been able to protect mice from nicotine dependence for life.
Further tests are needed before starting the human trials, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track all nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting his nicotine dose.
During the tests, mice vaccinated with nicotine were continued to perform normally.
But mice that had not been vaccinated "were soothed," the researchers said, indicating that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines were found to be ineffective because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be repeated so frequently that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms liver cells into antibody plants.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't get any fun because of the nicotin vaccine, and it can help them lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but pointed out that much more in-depth research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in an American drone strike on Friday in Pakistan, which was learned from the security services.
Hakimullah Mehsud's death has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the activist movement this time claimed that he lost his life in this strike, which took place in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone fire," said a senior security official.
The previous day, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, travelling to London, informed the British government that discussions had begun with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labour Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied having changed the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to find out whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeid own two restaurants and a coffee shop, after they expired in August 2005, without a call for tenders.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former Deputy Secretary General, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
In the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government has been pressing for a competitive bidding process for leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, leases for Circular Quay companies, which reported to the Obeid approximately $2.5 million per year, were renewed without a call for bids.
Mr Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tendering.
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr Obeid, who, admitted Mr Tripodi, was calling for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to the CICA showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under the direction of Mr. Obeid at the Department of Fisheries.
"Is the subject of these telephone conversations the development of the policy on commercial leases?" asked Mr. Tripodi, Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheaty.
"No," Mr. Tripodi replied.
I don't remember what we talked about, but anyway, it wasn't that.
At least certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, says official
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, says a military official at Fox News.
The official did not specify the target, but said that there was at least one target.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to take a "authenticity" test.
The Government is currently studying the possibility of introducing a "authenticity test" for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while considering extending enforcement measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion designed to prevent visas 457 from being used for unskilled positions or as a diversion to bring family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was released today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's foreign worker speech, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"The shattering statements about "foreigners returning to the end of the line" and "jobs for Australians first" are an unpleasant return at a time when trade unions were demanding a protected labour market," she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the whites had to be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historic artifact.
The discussion paper outlined the 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, while the others are under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for "whether the job offer is genuine if the applicant is a personal relationship or partner of the owner or the person concerned within the sponsoring company".
Companies may also be required to declare the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The panicked son of the 9-year-old man was travelling to Australia with him and has found some comfort since his father's death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A study to multiply the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring the United Kingdom together."
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will cover a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government increased the estimated cost of constructing the high-speed link between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of journey times for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travelling between Glasgow and Edinburgh for up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."
We push the HS2 project because its benefits are enormous.
Without it, we face a problem with the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to support "undoubtedly" Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland to the overall high-speed rail project across Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British government to explore options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps."
Rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being.
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the United States' move to relax electronic device regulations.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases provided they are in "air" mode.
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people find it difficult to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision that requires U.S. carriers to do significant work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they have no immediate intention of changing their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was reviewing the announcement but noted that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in effect in Australia.
"CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft," she said.
The issue is subject to regulation that requires aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained on an ongoing basis and passengers to comply with the safety instructions issued by crew members.
Virgin, who has already spoken to CASA about her intention to expand the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a review of CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (onboard entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft," said a spokesperson.
Qantas stated that it is currently complying with the current rules.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA's decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will be required to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as to review manuals, training equipment, hand baggage programs and instructions provided to passengers.
"As soon as an airline has checked its fleet tolerance, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stowed under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: At least four injured in a violent fight
The small commune of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday evening.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about thirty people according to testimonies gathered...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a fight involving several people broke out on the side of the Post Office.
At least four light injuries are reported to have occurred.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore’s pledge lenders take advantage of middle classes forced to tighten belt
Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, ring and pair of gold earrings at a pawnshop at Bendemeer Shopping Centre in Singapore to pay for her daughters' tuition fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, this week became the third pledge loan company to be introduced on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
To pledge jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Mrs.Amirthalinga – but it's almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore pledge lenders charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local funder with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawn lenders have the advantage of not asking for credit checks or proof of salary, and can release loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to pawn lenders as families feel the pressure of rising costs of living and the over-indebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and low-cost credit fuelled by overly lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pledge lenders to make up for the difference as their economies slow down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency cited the growing household debt, mainly due to the rise in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has just emerged this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the salary scale] are looking to supplement their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have made people quick to pledge their personal belongings to touch the cash value of their jewellery.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the pawnshops in the city-state's 200 pawnshops are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's pledge Grandma's gold chain and we'll come back for it next month."
In Thailand, EasyMoney, the largest provider of pawnshops, has registered a 20 per cent increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months.
The increase is such in the pledge lending sector that ValueMax, an operator of the Bendemeer boutique and 15 other boutiques like this one in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia – where it already has four boutiques – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its Managing Director.
The company will fund them using 60% of Singapore's $66 million raised this week when it was introduced on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have been criticized for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah indicates that pawning not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Customers mortgage property they already own, and monetizing their personal property does not increase household debt," she says.
Pledging is becoming increasingly socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed financing in the short term.
People who go to pawnshops are not only those who have financial problems.
The wealthy people of Singapore also go to the ValueMax pawnshops to pledge gold ingots or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see clients from all walks of life.
"They can be well-off people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment, or small businesses that need cash to get through a difficult course," says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor charged with child pornography in Nova Scotia
A minister who cared for young people in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia was charged with child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor officiated, was deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials indicated that Mr. Hudgins had resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under 18 years of age or access the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being chased out of it
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barred by an armband with a swastika was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complaining to the management of the establishment that called the police, said the store on Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesperson for the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to rescue her, but "by the time she arrived, he had already left without a break," she added.
I was in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were mouth-to-mouthed.
"You don't go out on the street like this unless you want to get attention," said 60-year-old Rosina Rusin at Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, Halloween Day, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a hoax.
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS armband twice a week for three years at Asda," said Paul Dutton, explaining that I'm suffering from "mental problems."
$325M Lifesaving Plan for the Tasmania Health System
The federal government maintains that the $325 million rescue plan for the vacillational health care system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the government of the state will not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking "emergency action" to end a crisis caused by the aging population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The funding, planned over 4 years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmania's independent MP, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-emergency surgical operations.
2,600 additional operations, including orthopaedic surgery and cataracts, will help to catch up.
Funding is also provided for non-rendezvous clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved external care, training of medical professionals, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, this is the best way to treat Tasmania's health care system," said Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Tasmania government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The government will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on the areas where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the government provides services in the most efficient and effective manner possible.
Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much "unless it is followed by a real reform to strengthen Tasmania's public health system."
However, he congratulated the government for responding to the urgent request for assistance that he made to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will go a long way towards removing Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "rich solution."
"The reason we're here is that the state Labour government has withdrawn $430 million from its health care system," he said on ABC TV.
We can't have a state government that rips out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that pays $300 million, and pretend that it's a great day.
Mr Dutton visited Mrs Plibersek to ensure that no dollar in the rescue plan would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel boasts a remarkable artistic direction and a meticulous period reconstruction, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Taking place in France in the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebelled, she faced the boundless cruelty of one Mother Superior deliberately sadistic and became an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pours into lubricity or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says surveillance agency
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, said the international chemical weapons monitoring agency on Thursday, while violent clashes were raging in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived one day ahead of the deadline for the
November 1st set by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or "make unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machines for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
It is estimated that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made at a time when fighting was raging on Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights based in Great Britain.
The group of activists, following the evolution of the human balance through a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, an estimated 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces were killed, of whom 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Of the deaths, an estimated 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 were opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated this figure since then.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
Al-Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom have been linked to al-Qaeda groups in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but gave no clarification.
The fighting stressed the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they have to complete their mission of ridding Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a continuing civil war within tight deadlines.
A statement by OPCW, working closely with the UN, stated that its team was "now satisfied with having controlled – and seen destroyed – all declared critical production and mixing and filling machines."
She added that "no other inspection activity was planned at this time."
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected".
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
"I salute the moral strength and courage you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of al-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the sentence handed down against one of the Bali bombers
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence handed down against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a firing squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old was convicted of mass killing for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and resulted in numerous injuries.
He was also convicted of many other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have requested a life sentence, yet they could have requested that the man, who was described as "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in bomb manufacturing, be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators almost 10 years ago.
On the brink of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"He should be dragged in front of the firing squad," Ms. Corteen told the PAA.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded into a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He sank into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he "dead" three times while under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues stated that Patek should have known the same fate as the three other members of Jemaah Islamiyah's terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
To spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American forces will kill the former leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in order to re-establish links between the South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaeda.
"He did not surrender," Ms. Corteen added.
Until recently, he made fun of the grief he had caused others.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of crying this year," said Corteen.
However, Patek can appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their mobile phones – under the highly anticipated new directives issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines will be required to demonstrate to the FAA that their aircraft are complying with the new guidelines and that they have updated crew member training manuals and aircraft storage rules to be in compliance.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"Based on the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to turn them on until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives its green light.
Passengers are expected to turn off their aircraft when the aircraft descends before landing and not turn them on until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground rolling, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Waitants, said she was pleased with these changes.
"Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers for this – it will benefit everyone," Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room supervisors" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, said the agency.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in air mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble-style game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was thrown out of an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the aircraft was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stored because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones rests with the Federal Communications Commission and not with the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national expert in transport safety on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if they are used on board," said Rosenker.
An industry advisory committee established by the FAA to review the issue recommended last month that the government allow for wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on its use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there are no valid security reasons for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become pervasive.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their aircraft, or deliberately do so.
The FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 as a result of reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the then high-tech gadget.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand FAA-approved electronic interference.
Airlines have allowed their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only issue minimal transmissions when you turn a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those who are pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's executives loaded a line plane of Kindle e-book readers and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has led members of the FAA Advisory Committee to have mixed feelings about whether or not the use of the devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers stated that he believed the interference from the aircraft was real, although the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA authorize pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings under low visibility conditions.
A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling for sensible arrangements for technology-equipped travellers.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not inconsistent with safety," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicopter bird from a platform in the North Sea was released into the wild
A bird, helicoptered after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, was released into the wild.
The water rail was flown aboard a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before it was put back on its feet by the Scottish SPCA in its rescue centre in Alloa.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This water rail was probably a winter migrant who came from northern Europe and found himself caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil rig.
He added: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help."
The water rail was healthy when released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing companies together and defining what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK entrepreneurs and asked them what they thought of Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 entrepreneurs, who are broadly representative of all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many.
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and developing while the EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than getting stuck in the long and arduous process of reforming Europe's institutional arcanes.
When asked for their views on specific policy issues – ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competencies should go back to Westminster.
The single market has caused general dissatisfaction, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area – 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and more importantly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based relationship with the EU rather than policy.
This conclusion, which can be found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world is insisting on a "significant change" that restores power to the UK.
The stakes are high – achieving a change in the Treaty and better representing Britain's interests would allow us to see a changeover of 16% of the votes in favour of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is embarking on a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for companies this means re-focusing on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in Brussels.
The United States with Halloween colors
In the United States, President Obama has not deviated from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed treats to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States were cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the partymen caught up with each other.
In New York, thousands of costumed people took part in the parade in the "Greenwich Village" neighbourhood.
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to wear the suit I had planned for last year.
We're having fun like crazy, Rhonda adds.
People are happy.
It's good kid, it's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated on the eve of All Saints, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom states that Bulgaria's gas pipeline is inaugurating a new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said Gazprom Director.
"A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project," said Alexei Miller, Managing Director of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout Europe.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine, through which most of the Russian gas destined for Europe flows, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into service in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, announced Thursday the daily Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, taking up information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago, is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory is 47 km2, with three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the mutineers of the Bounty, an episode in the history of the English navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the mutinies of the Bounty, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends 95% on the generosity of London.
The Island Council unanimously voted in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, i.e. 836,000 km2, which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would enable the United Kingdom to safeguard these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to monitor them, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port to place military surveillance vessels.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the ZEE of French Polynesia, close to Pitcairn.
The FAA eases restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on aircraft – but it will always be forbidden to make calls on mobile phones.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese vice governor
A former vice-governor of Jilin Province in northeast China was sentenced Friday to life imprisonment for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of hitting more than 19 million yuan in bribes, reports Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Vice Governor, who was also the president of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and officials to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared the first Beijing Intermediate Court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, considering that the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the Head of State promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "maches" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were condemned, among them former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CCP chief in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest positions within the state.
But the government has not shown any intention to reform the anti-corruption system by, for example, creating an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault following allegations against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two employees of the New South Wales YMCA were charged with sexual assaults against children as a result of allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it "had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization."
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: one YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education instructor from the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he was aware of the first case but was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate, noting, "external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that the safety of children was a top priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst ratings on four institutions during a quality audit carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that personnel management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA had a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failure to protect children.
Staff members testified that they had observed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that he kept them in private, seated them on his knees, told them that he loved them and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was under Lord's supervision and had requested child protection training because she was concerned about her behaviour, said that she found YMCA Caringbah's child services manager, Jacqui Barnat, who supervised Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General said that he rejected the staff testimony that they were reluctant to report these breaches to their supervisor.
Instead, he stated that their friendly relations with Lord have blurred their judgment, so they have not reported his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his views before the New South Wales YMCA Council that, for the organization, the lesson from "the Jonathan Lord incident" should not concern "reporting" by staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations were raised was made by the YMCA Director General for Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence, but that it was an “excess of zeal” and that it had been misimplemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, i.e. between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on child sexual abuse, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He indicated that there were “serious problems” in the recruitment, monitoring, induction, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but acknowledges that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old made his opinion known on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair would have replied, according to London's Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but it may likely happen, so..."
When many equestrian experts gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old child, to win.
Not yet in school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the toddler and his pony Shetland Toffee trotted during the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparables – which are of the same size – were praised for the presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition held at Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting himself against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side casually to scroll his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his unusual natural training qualities for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good grades for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and has since trained with his Shetland pony every day.
Her mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are making an excellent duo."
They presented themselves against each other, but both took the gold cut and the rosette.
It was only the second time he was competing with Toffee and we were crazy about the joy he won.
On the trail, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in southern Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air and everyone was encouraging and applauding it."
He ran through the entire length of the track and even though he seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
From the way he started, he'll probably be participating in the Horse of the Year event soon – and I'm sure he'll be doing a great performance.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee presented well and how they paraded on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he really looked great.
A Chinese newspaper that has launched a call "will be reworked"
A Chinese newspaper that has launched a front-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be revamped, says a press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based New Express issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express is going to undergo a "full overhaul," said the regulator.
The order of "reshuffle" comes from the administration of Guangdon for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"New Express's writing was disorganized," said the regulator in a statement.
He stated that he had decided "to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card."
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete overhaul of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into those responsible for New Express and immediately remanage the newspaper's management team."
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a front-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing false stories for money.
"In this case, I harmed Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told the CCTV public television network.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express released his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several prominent suspects have recently made televised confessions.
Specialists say that people are systematically forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier this year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is on the run.
The radioactive vapour leak detected on one of the Charles de Gaulle's two nuclear boilers in mid-October and while the ship was at sea was "safe for the sailors", but is not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royale has confirmed to us "the unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, DCNS, a naval defence specialist, assures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "are currently intervening on the carrier aircraft".
For them, among other things, it is a question of changing a pump on the defective boiler room.
"Everything is being done so that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013", explains DCNS.
And the National Navy to certify that "it does not in any way call into question the programme of activity of the ship" with nuclear propulsion.
Recall that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier is coming out of an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had flown from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, in order to qualify young pilots as hunters.
A "small damage", confined to the containment space of the reactor, had then occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a great deal of discontent on the part of the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, deluge of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs not to be finished.
In short, siphoning our pockets without limits.
Millions of dilapid dollars could be saved to allow a much respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money forcibly taken from taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no problem with the lavish expenditure and maintenance of lame ducks: a cultural centre with a deficit, a strong subsidy to the Cité de l'Énergie, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, sell them to private companies or demolish them.
It is also gratifying to note the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honourable mention to the transformation of the former Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to tax payers?
It is not at the public level to invest in such companies, but at the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that the lakes at the Peach and Batteries will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water users) and the large population decline, water use has declined significantly across the country.
Without meaning to waste it, the city will never run out of water and severe regulations on its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We've been managed for over 40 years by ties with good degrees for the most part and I don't think a sheep breeder is doing any worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, was discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the four-foot-by-three tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzaging along a length equivalent to nearly six long football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, USA.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, making it easy to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out by passing unnoticed, the authorities said.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They shall be sentenced to imprisonment from 10 years to life imprisonment if they are convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate large underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major crossing discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the harvest of marijuana in central Mexico in October, thus posing a challenge for drug cartels who must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railway tracks that started from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue extradition warrant against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a “notice of surrender” against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not do so, he would be subject to arrest.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after exhausting all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June, asking that South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asks him to report to a police station at the time and time of his choice," a spokesperson said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of spying, after having unveiled more than 250,000 American diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting against secret information.
How biometrics will invade our lives
No more passwords to type to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French and Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy director general of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person making transactions in a universe as transverse and transnational as the Internet.
Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this craze for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
In 2011 alone and in France alone, the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés has authorised 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the form of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified anywhere and anytime," said Justin Brookman, consumer privacy manager at the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometry will be based on new techniques that will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people who work the concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible," says Philippe Robin, Technical Director of the domain of identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand presuppose a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
This is both a security - we cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been conducted over the last twenty years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the coloured part of the eye).
By increasing the accuracy of the sensors and the computing capacity of the computers required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the past five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture's R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today, we're doing research on voice recognition or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sridhar Iyengar, Intel Labs Security Research Director.
A unique and falsifiable marker, DNA is also a source of hope and concern.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective Studies at the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers the criminal investigation police a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in one hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is the one they claim to be).
Identification has so far been concerned with the issue of identity papers: biometrics (fingerprints, photographs, iris) must be compared with the information the State has on all citizens already registered.
This ensures that a person does not attempt to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance to a hotel or store.
"We collect images from surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities who circulate freely on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, NEC France's manager of business development for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: take a picture of a quidam who queues in a store, track his progress through facial recognition and calculate wait time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens, etc.) or logical access (opening of a computer).
In addition, more recently, presence control has been introduced.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend who points for another," explains Cyrille Bataller of Accenture.
But, more and more, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors by introducing their card and placing their hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the keystroke of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and retail stores: when paying in-store with its credit card, the customer does not type his code, but inserts his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Tracks to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in the box 30 seconds less, it is appreciable," explains the manager of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
And, finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect the databases.
"The fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which is blocked if you try to move it," says Philippe Robin of Thales.
But, due to the lack of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Privacy experts continue to be concerned.
"The progress of facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance," predicts Andrew Patrick of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.
A driver travelling 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was given an almond of £1,000.
A motorist was fined £1,000 for driving 210 km/h with a warm drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old, from Tiptree in Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they found the drink to take between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the conduct offence without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points removed from his licence led to a 6-month licence withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of £90 and a victim surcharge of £100.
A tax on foreign homeowners to break the London bubble
The Consolidated Revenue Fund has provisionally quantified the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision by Mr.Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, recorded a stamp duty of 7% for properties costing more than £2 million and annual fees for buyers who choose to own properties in a corporation rather than as an individual.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea boroughs, representing £708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, exceeding the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Cook said: "Following the increase in the stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of anti-avoidance legislation in this area, it is very difficult to argue that high-value properties are under-taxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
Prestigious real estate – the 5-10 percent of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous area south-west of London stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by a record 11.8 percent over the past year.
Prices in central London show steady annual growth of 5.6% but have been overshadowed by a growing "domestic market", with the southwest of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) recovering, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog's tail are related to his mood.
Previous studies had shown that happy dogs moved their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs moved them more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "Everyone knows that in man, the left and right sides of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what was happening in other species.
He added that just as in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disordered tail movements of other dogs, the researchers followed animals watching movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behaviour.
It probably won't take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We presented to dogs films featuring other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion – and we were able to traffic the movement of the tail and present it as going more left or right."
When the animals saw an unexpressed dog moving the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog moving the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail drifting mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog moving the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that dogs deliberately communicated with each other through these movements.
Instead, he thinks that dogs know from experience what movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you meet more than once with other dogs and notice that most of the time their tail movement to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience."
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Canine Behaviour Expert John Bradshaw, visiting professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University discovered that the dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "The dogs went more easily to a robot dog when its tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study."
He indicated that the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs that participated in the various studies did not fully consider the animals of the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although there are many elements in different mammals that indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why their tails sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpones concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after his singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
Sheffield's band was scheduled to perform Friday in the downtown The Hydro concert hall.
However, his laryngite forced singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the band was forced to reschedule a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after seeking medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show to the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1st."
"Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets that he cannot perform in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the show at the Glasgow Hydro will take place on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest churchmen placed in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – it is therefore a group of 120 "cardinal voters".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting bringing together all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops would be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as the Consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the Consistory of February in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal voters will likely have decreased.
He said that a pope usually appointed as many cardinals as necessary to ensure that the number of cardinal voters reached 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
Next year's consistory will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, said Valero.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will name cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world to examine ways of reforming the church.
Previously, the pope decided on his own.
"Now François has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "very possible" for Francis to seek advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is totally new.
Valero indicated that the popes generally raised bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was "full of surprises – so we don't know who he will name".
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the seat back
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to resolve a problem with manually tilting files, according to a statement by the U.S. vehicle safety regulator on Friday.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a defect in the tilt mechanism.
As a result, records do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the head restraint may not adequately protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) site.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the first U.S. car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect in the first fortnight of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the letter of information to owners due to the 16-day shutdown of government operations, which slowed down the growth in vehicle sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM's stock price climbed 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks on Thursday afternoon in Montreal.
The drama occurred at approximately 11:00 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the borough of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations had been going on there for some time.
A adjoining foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the site to recover his tools.
I was driving by and saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who remains close to the construction site.
I came down and went to remove the big bricks that covered him.
You could only see part of his back, it's so unhappy.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his 50s who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation manoeuvres were attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was dispatched to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
The cry of despair of an Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says Obama has made commendable efforts thwarted by the obstructionism of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor drone attacks
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Faculty of Medicine.
I'm reading a awfully sad book these days.
It's a book that I thought would encourage me during the morosity of the second year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's the memories of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical reports of my patients in the evening and went to bed, this book takes me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and where speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and newscasters took the time to reflect on the historic nature of the moment.
My comrades cried with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was advancing towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before taking office in 2008, he had 82% favourable views.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of our army from Iraq, to the end of the "unseen and unknown" and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the brink of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
She cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the government's misdeeds.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the escape of public funding and the overexpenditure allowed during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report which says that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive ... since the administration of Nixon".
And, more recently, she cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unsophisticated alternative that did not seem to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we had heard about for so long.
Yet, while the index of favorable opinions plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He makes me want the many promises that have flown away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton in Pennsylvania's Primary.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they had to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We have to remember who we are.
We're five years later, Mr. President, and I don't agree with you anymore.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, didn't wear a helmet.
Despite the rapid emergency response, he died in this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest regarding the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from this system.
The mining magnate, challenging the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, argued this argument in an attempt to rule out issues of potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be eliminated.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to benefit personally from these policies.
"He will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying for parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the election commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr Palmer put forward the idea of reshaping the system of counting votes in order to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why couldn't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your contact information in a computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6:30 a.m. the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission had considered options for electronic voting and had recently issued a joint concept paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new duties "very seriously."
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We are not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, scientific mission manager at the Observatoire pour la Conservation et l'Etude des Animaux et Milieus Marins (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprise you?
That is good news, but I am not particularly surprised.
While in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge of species classification sciences.
Moreover, it is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology call into question the classification or membership of a species in a genus, family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are being questioned due to advances in genetics.
In the same way, two closely related species were distinguished morphologically by genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
About ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have identified four species.
Why is this an important discovery, as the Wildlife Conservation Society has stated?
From a conservation perspective, knowledge of these genetic differences is essential to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
While this population had been known to researchers for a long time, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only there.
Therefore, if there is a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than with a local disappearance of a population of a species that is more widespread on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered based on the number of existing individuals on Earth, that is, the stock, and the potential for recovery from neighbouring stocks.
As for the Sousa chinensis species, whose population of the new species was discovered, its stock automatically became smaller, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene brewing limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which may eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It is important to know that the marine environment is the least well known.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, than to know what lives in the Mariannes' pit, only 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent on finding life on other planets than on marine research, and it is high time it changed.
RBS suspends two traders in the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division according to two sources close to the file, again showing that the regulators' global investigation into suspicions of currency market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where US$5.3 trillion is changing hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the scandal of manipulations of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this case is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the CFA and other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file reported that RBS had sent emails and instant messages to and from a former trader to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European currency cash trader at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European cash exchange trader at Citi, was on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, adding sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it had brought an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, stated that it was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
Around the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating allegations about bankers who have agreed to manipulate exchange rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from regulators, reported sources close to the file.
Banks scan instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
The news about these investigations has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest growth engines of investment bank trading units in recent years, but has been questioned this year because of the low volatility of currencies that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the large highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
One senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at little cost".
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had sent a trader working in its London Stock Exchange fund office this week after it caused a $6 million loss at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case has been mastered," said a representative of Credit Suisse.
Mayor Rob Ford's investigation has been sloppy, says lawyer
After the police confirmed that they had taken a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby argued that he had never seen an investigation that was "so messy".
Ruby told La Presse Canadienne that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional driver Alexander Lisi, 35 years old, and accused him of extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police said they also observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, point to new court documents.
Ruby described as "unexplainable" the fact that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or tapped his phone, arguing that Chief of Police Bill Blair knowingly chose not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and carried out a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash described Mr. Ruby's remarks as "obvious and desperate attempt" to make himself known to the media in a case that is not of any concern to him.
In a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" for bringing a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Stock Exchanges down at mid-meeting, except London
With the exception of London, the main European stock exchanges are moving down Friday mid-term, led by some disappointing company news, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
On the other hand, investors remain cautious as they believe that the US Federal Reserve could undo its policy of quantitative easing earlier than expected.
On the other hand, after the announcement of inflation at 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spreading among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could relax its monetary policy.
The futures of Wall Street suggest an opening up of American equities, after two consecutive retreat sessions.
In terms of values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest decline of the CAC 40, driven by the warning on results of its Nissan Motor partner on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, having also published downgrading results this morning and announced the creation of an internal bad bank with 38 billion pounds of riskiest assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the top of the EuroFirst300 increases in response to press reports that AT&T is studying a possible takeover.
On the foreign exchange market, speculation on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy is well under way, as evidenced by John Hardy, Saxo Bank's strategist.
The ECB's single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for a fall in the euro.
In this context, the euro continues to fall against the US currency and hit a two-week lower in session at $1.3517.
These same conjectures, on the other hand, support the euro area bond market.
Supreme Court validates Obama's Health System Reform Act
Great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court today declared that the health system reform law ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, or to pay a fine – and declared that it was constitutional under the government's taxing power.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page law and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered under penalty of losing all federal funding for the programme, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates in the 2012 presidential election, including candidate-designate Mitt Romney, were fiercely opposed to the law.
Vibrant tribute to veterans in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid a tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and deceased of all wars.
Garbage was deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by MP-mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Israeli-Palestinian clinging on the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on Thursday, October 31, 2013 in the evening during a violent clash on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory in the past year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip stopped operating on Friday, 1 November, after its fuel stocks were depleted, the Palestinian enclave energy authority announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another Hamas operative, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by shell fire during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Yunes in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local Al-Qassam Brigade officials, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armoured bulldozer made a 100-metre incursion inside the territory before withdrawing afterwards.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had died during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell defending the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupier into Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," the spokesman threatened.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, for “terrorist activities”.
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the purpose was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military statement.
During the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive device targeting IDF forces (the Israeli army) and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel to attack Israeli civilians," said army spokesman Peter Lerner.
In addition, Israel struck an air force base in north-west Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hizbullah, reported on Thursday, 31 October, the satellite channel Al-Arabiya.
An American official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not give details of the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he added.
Officials from the Israeli government refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that she did not name, the Saudi capital chain indicated that "the bombing targeted a shipment of ground-to-air missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", in reference to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions heard on Wednesday at dawn at an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
The organization, relying on a network of medical activists and sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents Dance Dance with her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by Henri Michaux's inks and poems, the second inspired by Satie's famous piano solos Gymnopédies.
An evening that allows to see the whole prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and black ink to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Théâtre Maisonneuve, progresses, profile, fine as a line and clothed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink by Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, simple trait, takes its form.
And this form will be that of the whole room: a string of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, entirely dressed in black, only the hands and face discovered, wait on either side of the playing area, rush when the next graphic appears, incarnate it, come out running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is done in relay of solos, in group in unison (a mass that makes solo), in large group of twelve solos where each one executes his sign.
We think of "Glory of the morning", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, posed online at the forestage.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is strong, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rhythm is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, part of Michaux' poem, monocord and monotonous in the scream, and will continue while dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to go back.
This loud and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up deafening and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are a few beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - like those hairs that swirling or those black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, has established herself, with her tics.
The result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux inks, like Gestalt forms, open up a broader and gibbling imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers chopped by a strobe light and white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches magic.
The audience liked it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopedias, after the intermission, is richer.
The scene is partly draped with grey, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a neglected house.
On the piano, dancers take turns playing the scores.
Their clumsiness in music, touching, gives a real fragility.
On stage, spend couples, in romantic duets, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving ensembles, choirs, writing is less binary.
Buffoons appear, also familiar to Chouinard, with a red nose, in highly polarized male-female loving parades.
Loves are carnassiers, fugitives or players.
The gesture, the laughter and the little cries beautifully translate the archaic, the grace and the ridiculousness of the bodies into coitus, beings that melt.
But the play takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back on stage when the audience leaves.
There everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the dancers cabotinate, descend among the spectators, glare, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, spread the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness transpire, and it is Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are being prosecuted for Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents began an avalanche of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company he put on the pole during the patent auction that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the U.S. Assize Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that make it possible to display advertising in relation to search terms on the Internet, indicated the findings of the trial, which is the core business of Google.
It was not possible to reach representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that operate under Google's Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, finally offering $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market partly based on Motorola's patent library.
"Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at issue during the auction, it violated and continues to violate those patents," said the trial's findings.
Rockstar claims greater damages against Google because it claims that Google's patent infringement is obstinate, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
Grandma would have lit a cigarette in a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a faulty water heater, said Friday night the King's attorney's substitute.
The expert dispatched by the Public Prosecutor's Office ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette when there was a leak and a build-up of gas.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is still engaged.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and companion, was at his side and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on site before being taken to the CHU in Liège, she by helicopter, him by ambulance," said the mayor José Paulet, who went down on the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the CPAS.
Andenne and Namur firefighters and Arches police intervened.
Crisnée's civil protection has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks the first freely elected president to take the oath
Mohamed Morsi took the oath of investiture, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he took the oath of investiture to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was expelled from power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the Constitutional High Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of State of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before the 18 judges in black robe of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for better tomorrows, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations of a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer formed in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal and harshly repressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the Court to acclaim the new president and, standing out from the presidential fascination of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs.
Considered to be the uncharismatic "saving wheel" of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has been considerably strengthened since his victory and his speech on Friday during which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian President Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges present in the room decorated with woodwork where he took his oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he delivered his investiture speech.
He was officially greeted by a military band that played the national anthem while he was on guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song "The People and the Army, Hand in Hand...", which was enthroned by thousands of people gathered in the university's large amphitheatre.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a fief of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, from which the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian regime last year began, and vowed to regain the presidential powers of which the military council, which replaced the former ousted president, dispossessed him.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
Shutdown in the USA has curbed the rise in the car market
The 16-day closure of most federal administrations weighed on the growth in car sales in the United States in October, showing figures released Friday by manufacturers, with five of the top six achieving performance below expectations.
Detroit's three major manufacturers show double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts forecast an average of 15.4 million sales on an annualized and seasonally adjusted basis, but the market was estimated to be 15.3 million according to Morgan Stanley's analyst Adam Jonas.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight brake is explained in the first place by "the government 'shutdown' and its impact on the consumer's feeling during the first fortnight of the month".
However, GM reported an increase of almost 16% in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands have seen their business performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pick-ups, saw its sales grow by 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194,301.
For its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also show below-consensus sales, despite year-over-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, the GM share won 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford gave up 1.1%.
Renault leaded on the stock market by Nissan's warning
On Friday, Renault recorded the biggest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced that it had reduced its annual net profit forecast by almost 20%, traders report.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a review, also announced a realignment of its management.
Several traders reported that the Renault action was affected this morning by the "warning".
"It's clearly Nissan's warning profit," says a trader in a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to data from Nissan's website.
Greece: Two dead in a shooting near a neo-Nazi party local
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night by shots fired by two people who were on a motorcycle passing in front of a room of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party in the western suburbs of Athens, it was learned from police sources.
The police were not in a position at the moment to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had claimed that the victims were guards from their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Anti-terrorist officers dispatched to the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio suburb, where the incident took place and sealed the neighborhood.
The incident occurred a few weeks after the indictment of six deputies from Golden Dawn, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in "a criminal organization" as part of an offensive against that party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal dismissed
Scott Brown, captain of Celtic Glasgow, has been dismissed and will be well suspended for his club's next two Champions League matches against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against the Barça for having shot Neymar, the Scottish community saw its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed", considering that his appeal was entirely justified.
Nearly 50,000 households are without electricity throughout the province, shortly after noon on Friday, due to high winds in many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The sectors most affected are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the dark, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The Greater Montreal area also has its share of outages with nearly 7,000 households without power in the metropolis and Laval.
You thought travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be reversing the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecasts upwards and hopes for record results thanks to vacationers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects to realize an underlying profit for the entire fiscal year between $325 million and $340 million before taxes, compared to a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in 2011/12.
Director General Graham Turner stated that Flight Centre had made 8 per cent of profits in the first half of the year and that the second half of the year had started hard, particularly with regard to non-business travel to Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present have been profitable, and several of them are on track to achieve record results for the entire fiscal year before deducting interest and taxes," he said.
This applies to Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the biggest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half of the year, compensating for a slight decline in the domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the United Kingdom, Flight Centre's leisure travel industry performed well while business customers spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses in the first half of the year, when seasonal demand was lower and was expected to earn a profit for the third time in a row.
Flight Centre stock increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknowns shoot at a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Unknown hooded people opened fire this Friday on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without causing any casualties, the result of an apparent quarrel with dismissed employees.
The attackers fled, said the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, police general Abdel Latif.
This attack comes at a time when Egypt has received almost no tourist since the army removed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi at the beginning of July and repressed the protests of his supporters in blood.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English literature classes, students will have to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also introduce "new texts" to encourage a more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
Starting in 2015, students will have to pass an independent GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish tomorrow its new English and math programs – the raw materials to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other fundamentals next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Board of Examiners, will unveil a redesign of the GCSE structure, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking over the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was a "wide consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence," stressing that the GCSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and Singapore students do about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government indicated that the in-depth GCSE of math – as well as the greater emphasis on subjects in international rankings – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of instruction.
The program will place more emphasis on "real world problems", including financial mathematics.
This ruling means that a law adopted in July in that State, widely calling into question the right to abortion, will be able to enter into force.
An octagenarian welcomes children with a rifle at the Muy for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 were door-to-door asking for candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy district visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The old man, 86 years old, told the gendarmes that he had been afraid.
His gun's been seized.
The former head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without his trace ever being found, was in fact buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte in 1945," he assured the daily newspaper with a large circulation based on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, would answer one of the great enigmas of the Postwar era.
The German secret service, the BND, thus ensured that during the summer of 1949 Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were totally wrong.
"From August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando," Tuchel said.
He was wearing "a general's uniform."
"In the left inner pocket were his service records with a photo," he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the district council of the district of Mitte in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The president of the Central Council of Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, expressed shock at this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists be buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormity of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is grossly trampled with their feet," he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the prominent figures of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroon's villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, just 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect him "CNN Heroes of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his or her extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of conscience and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a haematoma that he would carry the sequelae for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could get.
"It's not easy," adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, walk to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr. Bwelle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the country's health expenditure is in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," said Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr.Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed over 700 surgical procedures free of charge over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaoundé.
And it has created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about 30 people, they pile up in vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and crossing difficult terrain to get to the villages most in need of help.
Chance doesn't always follow them.
They had to push the vehicles many times to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best available accommodation.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to party, and Dr.Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began receiving hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people each time we visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
Sometimes they live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical procedures under local anaesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school, town hall or house; after the procedure, the patient gets up and goes to the wake-up room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of equipment, Dr.Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a grueling rhythm, but village musicians usually help the team stay motivated.
"They're hitting drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working," said Mr. Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 surgical procedures free of charge over the past year, and knows that their presence can make all the difference for those they help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"It will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to living this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr.Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer with Dr. Bwelle's group.
He's still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is an on-the-ground learning opportunity they don't have at home.
"We were able to take part in operations to help wash the blood or get Dr. Bwelle through the instruments," said Ms. O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in the second year.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their pensions, transportation and teaching are taken care of by Dr Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not nearly extinguished.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," added Mr. Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons why I do that.

Pierre Nora's two Frances
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheatre and classrooms?
Undoubtedly, but emphasising its weakness for the crossroads, Sciences-Po, the Hautes Etudes.
Arbitrator of the works of others in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the editor.
Heir of the armchair that Fontenelle occupied at the French Academy?
Certainly still, but knowing that such a sacre cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, of which it has happened.
They readily recognized in him a great awakener, animator and unifying of their work, but pointed out that he was reluctant to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked languages were able to see there a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, endowed with a keen glance and a lot of erudition, but incurably dilettante.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the one who passed away from writing had much and well written.
The book here should definitely do him justice.
Yet, once again, we find there the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagrancy, jubilation set to jump as if at feet together from one subject to another.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the dealer back to one and the same passion: to discover the constitutive knot of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: this is an ancient concern.
Not long ago, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our then leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliging, was entrusted to the prefects and the sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora is chasing is quite different.
He does not pose as heir of an eternal francity, he refuses to define.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders in a forest of symbols, stopped every step by an object in the form of a rebus, tormented by irritating questions.
Of which this one, which is born of the company itself: why, in a country so long-term settled in its borders, so formerly built and solidly masoned, do we hear these dramatic calls to unity?
They are only so pressing, Pierre Nora suggests, to ward off the disorder born of the discords of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one that splits national history in half.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French had two stories and they had two nations, one monarchic and the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without succeeding in denying it; on the contrary, anxious to regain its sacrality and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility because it had cut off the head to the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And, from there, an invinciblely binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity felt, nothing is worth the four steps out of the Hexagone, so that Pierre Nora's American getaway might well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But the American cousinship only makes it better to emphasize what is unique to us.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men congested by an ancient indigenous regime, and all the more radical.
There a consensual revolution when here it sows drama and confits it.
There are still honored founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors who are struggling to make models, and who have killed each other.
There is institutional consistency, and here there is a cascade of constitutions, like mistakes to catch up and attempts to resume.
France is leaving, France is coming.
Yet there was a time when the French believed they could stitch the torn dress in their history, and overcome the curse of number two.
At this third republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed great interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything that in ancient France was obscurely preparing modern France and proposing them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity only had a time.
Here it is again in debate, shaken by a new kind of immigration, threatened by the rise of minority claims, absorbed in the European area.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France that goes away and the circumspect sketch of France that comes.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve a few surprises.
We discover that the chemineau was a casanier.
The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The edger stood in the centre of the centre.
And he who had tabled, more than half a century ago, a subject on the idea of a nation, but had avoided the initialistic exercise of the thesis, confided to us, cum grano salis, that he would eventually have done it.
Certainly in a less stiff form, more burst and more subtle.
But let us not be mistaken, just as binding.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis speaks of the inner necessity of a life.
Former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is quite complex to manage"
Abducted in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his team of "Antenne 2" who came to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the hostage defence association "Otages du monde", which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the possibility for hostages to lodge complaints and bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
The four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, little by little, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" asked 62-year-old Jean-Louis Normandin, former great reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages du monde".
By the night of your release, you were on the 8 p.m. set of "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
On site, in Beirut.
When I get released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's dark - Roger Auque.
He says, "We're free," but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but we're very tense too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They're dropping us off on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the Summerland hotel site where the press is present.
Frenchmen take us to the French embassy.
It's time for the first calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a t-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night talking to Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How was your arrival on French soil?
We're landing in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible rush.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three television channels.
I'll be right back and there's plenty of them.
The descent of the plane stairs, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers pull themselves to take pictures and follow me to my home where I have to do a little police to prevent some of them from climbing.
The media pressure is huge.
It doesn't stop, we're in a good position to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We're out of a hole and suddenly we're under media fire.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to manage.
But we did the hardest.
That night, I'm at 8:00, and the next day, I'm on TV.
Then start some kind of rehabilitation to life, very slowly, for one or two months that are a bit like a vacation.
How did the medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing go?
I had a first medical check in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Grâce on the following days: radios, exams of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can rely on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not given to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostage takers.
That made sense.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I'm listening to what I'm saying.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things piss me off, others less.
I'm trying to make a difference between the questions about my past as a hostage and my hat as president of the "Otages of the World" association that allows me to distance myself, and I think it's much more interesting to talk about.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I fight, with others, for recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there's a semantic problem.
Hostage-taking must be described as "political" - most often the case - and the hostages must be allowed access to justice, to lodge complaints and to bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages might also have access to justice?
That's what a court in The Hague is for.
Why don't we say to the hostage-takers "you've flouted the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva Conventions, we're going to bring you to justice"?
It seems to me, however, well founded, legitimate, common sense.
This message is heard, but not heard, and I am shocked.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the streets to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger is raging in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of the fallen President Mohamed Morsi began, they went down the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the re-establishment of the country's first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial, this militant of the Muslim Brotherhood points out.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a prank.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial and he's the one who's supposed to have Sisi tried, not the other way around.
Morsi must try Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Fighting broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed in front of the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses 9 US states of violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state recognized homosexual marriage, "all military spouses are entitled to an identity card from the Department of Defense and the benefits that come with it," recalled the minister in New York in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League against Anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities" located on their territory, he denounced, accusing them of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided at these bases, or access their shops.
The Secretary of Defence said he ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure that the federal law was implemented.
The frond of the nine states began with Texas, which refuses to implement these services on the facilities of the Texas National Guard, due to a conflict between the Texas law and the federal law on homosexual marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defence officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage to be about 5600 active persons, 17,000 including the National Guard, the reserve and pensioners.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place on Saturday 2 November at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump association, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registration takes place on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will begin at 10 a.m. before the final scheduled for 3 p.m. and the award ceremony at 4 p.m.
The audience will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend the competitions at the highest level, like the young hyerois prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years old, he has already won his place this year for the European championships in Copenhagen and he likes nothing so much as to bring back competitors who exceed him by three heads.
Mayor of Toronto hunts journalists to question him on a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drugs, according to several media outlets.
A video delivered to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The individual, Rob Ford, has always denied having consumed crack, while acknowledging that he has a tendency for cannabis.
On Thursday, he chased several journalists from his property to interview him.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in Val-d'Oise
On Thursday, 31 October, the authorities announced that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in Val-d'Oise, obviously of foreign origin, while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies has been confirmed by the Institut Pasteur.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and take care of people who could have come into contact with this kitten between 8 October and 28 October," the ministries of health and agriculture say.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In man, the preventive treatment of human rabies, given after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the press release says.
The ministries now call on people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or skin damaged by this kitten or whose animal was in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"France has been free of rabies since 2001, this kitten or the mother have been imported from another country, not free", according to the press release.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "aboriginal" case of rabies recorded was in December 1998 on a fox and that "France was officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE)".
One case of rabies on a bitch illegally imported from Gambia had been recorded in 2008.
"Rage is a fatal disease if it is not treated in time," said the ministries and it is transmissible for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama reverses his reform of the health care system
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that "if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received termination notices from their claimants, Republicans criticized the president in the last few days accusing him of cheating on the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with appropriate health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "a rush in the news" about terminations, President Obama urged the Americans who received these notices to look for new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better adapted health plans for the same price, even less expensive than expected.
"You'll win," he said.
The Authority has announced that it should not be surprised if the 5% of the population who take out their own insurance were forced to change their plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius in his testimony before the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, indicated that the launch of the online market in October had failed "unfortunately."
"I'm as frustrated and irritated as anyone," she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, when she believed her microphone was cut, by speaking to an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday's Assembly session following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, the Republican representative of Missouri, as to whether she should join the Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long repeatedly asked Ms.Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts of millions of Americans.
Vettel struts a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky winner, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colours of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the level of the track.
Germany's Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula 1 world champion, drew a special helmet for the free practice of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday, designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen among 1,500 drawings sent from all over the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, an automobile brand, of his stable.
He was invited to follow Abu Dhabi's GP, with a friend, and can thus see closely the German champion, on the track and at his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday, at the test.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
A Resident of Aubervilliers Launches Suburban Party
Let us not deceive ourselves.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Suburban Party" is not only aimed at the suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of the suburbs, I speak to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
Nevertheless, his project, presented Thursday in a press conference in his native commune of Aubervilliers, was born out of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes the neighbourhoods above all.
My first proposal is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attaché, claims today to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are linked to the left, but if the right-wingers are ready to support me, I will listen to them too, he continues.
Only extremist parties I don't talk to.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program - available on the Internet - based on many themes that are supposed to speak to suburban residents and especially young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years old, the rehabilitation of the function of building warden...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, it is likely to be fair," he admits.
It's a matter of time and money.
The Suburban Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune claims to already have seven lists in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails I received since yesterday do not all emanate from the suburbs" he rejoices.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that American espionage "had gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry pointed to a softening of the US defensive attitude towards its surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions espionage "had gone too far inappropriately."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had ruled on "automatic pilot" when a series of incendiary revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities came into being.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have learned of certain things in autopilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War until the difficult years of the Cold War, then of course on 11 September."
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had gone beyond limits, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far inappropriately."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels mistaken.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force acting for the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We did stop planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to fight terrorism with the U.S., the Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut indicated that he had spoken to the members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had made to a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration generated by the surveillance of the National Security Agency.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain at our side in the mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and chair of the United States Senate Sub-Committee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has received millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with some of the US allies, but the agency's director said this week that this was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the US.
Other revelations referred to documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other Heads of State.
The Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified the Allied espionage by stating that it was necessary and common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a congressional trip, scheduled to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and of both chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was not only to improve relationships, but also to show "loving firmness."
He explained that European heads of state should be honest with their citizens about the type of spying programmes they have been implementing for years.
"We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world who do spying," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry has planned to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the resentment generated by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by United States surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, driven by Shell's poor performance and in the wake of an announcement by the Fed that it will continue to support the economy as planned.
Australian woman appeals her sentence of imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident of Sydney, sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the judgement and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Province Court on June 15 of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance footage later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket's police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to inventing the story of all the pieces.
She was detained in a cell at the local police station before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who called on Canberra's foreign ministry to help her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
"We've obviously had an agonizing time, but we hope to get her home safely as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after a 50,000 baht bail.
In Australia, the press reported that, in the meantime, it was on vacation in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer from Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years' imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to restore her damaged image with tourists, which could lead to acquittal.

Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
One year ago, this prompted a consultation with parents, students, teachers and educational staff to consider how to better integrate students living on horseback between different cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
Vision diversité has been walking around schools for a year to help students of all origins discover common landmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of origin or have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"So we create projects so that they identify with all this," explains Vision Diversity President Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne of the Institut du Nouveau Monde has identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the sense of belonging, the support of staff in the transformations we are experiencing, within the student clientele," he lists.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board has created a research centre that will give tools to teachers who, too, sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz of the Université de Montréal will be its Scientific Director.
Preparing to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"Different educational strategies, that's the real need," she sums up.
Research will focus on inclusion from all perspectives: linguistic, academic, social and cultural.
