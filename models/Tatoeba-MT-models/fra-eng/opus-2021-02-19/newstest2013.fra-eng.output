A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers the latter a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
Indeed, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the U.S.
It is in this spirit that a majority of US governments enacted new laws from 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon grew after the November 2010 elections, which added 675 new Republican representatives to 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day and remove the right to vote from citizens with judicial records.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana's law in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present photo ID cards.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have universal identity cards such as the health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID card.
Much more.
Students, voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID card issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators in 2011 sponsored laws abolishing voter registration on election day in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register approximately 10 million citizens.
However, measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter accounted for only 13% of the state's voters.
The same was true with Hispanics.
They represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In return, the whites who made up 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of the democrat governors.
The US Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They may have partially limited the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have enacted legislation requiring the presentation of photo ID cards.
Nevertheless, the new rules introduced will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as a clear objective to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes necessary for the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: whether to take the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes present erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men who are already reluctant to take screening tests even more hesitant.
Do you want to take the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In studies in the United States, there was a lot of contamination among control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, found a difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
This study also demonstrated, with follow-up after 12 years, that there is between 30 and 40% more chance of metastases if undetected.
So I recommend the test from 50 years of age, or from 40 years of age if you have a direct parent who has had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once we've detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the level of risk of his or her cancer, by offering him or her options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect life in the long run, and by opting instead, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest that they do active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
Increasingly, criteria are being determined precisely to decide who should or should not be treated.
So I recommend taking the test anyway.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with his doctor to determine whether or not we should go through it.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the APS test.

Preventing disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, the adoption of good lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of harm.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, this rate would increase to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many also remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Cigarettes are linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
This is a huge harm to people's health.
"Also today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
Weight
Overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease, according to CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer," it is added.
Food
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
Too much, it increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
Charcuteries too, and they should be avoided.
The storage of meat by smoking, drying or salting may result in the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"These can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," it is explained.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research is, however, inconclusive at the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to CSC.
While one noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also unclear.
Mr. Beaulieu also stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his physician.
"Take a screening test, it doesn't give you cancer."
The Higgs shelled boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created a great stir last summer, and for good reason.
Indeed, we believe that this boson participates in the responsible mechanism of the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that this is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be absolutely certain.
Let's assume, however, that this is the Higgs, since the chances of getting wrong seem slim, and let's see what it's about.
There is, in this world, a fatally inescapable law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
But even if particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - that "state" consisting roughly of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner there are good citizens named fermions, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
And in the other there are bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, depending on the site (absolutely extraordinary, moreover) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not address here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosons, we must emphasize here, are not all animals as exotic as we might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "messager" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "dranges" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a bit like a rock thrown into a pond.
From this "drangement" arises an electromagnetic wave (from light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "carriers of force".
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, except that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
However, this Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to reach very, very high energies, a bit as if it were a frozen pond of which only a very large rock could ride the surface.
This is why it takes a huge particle accelerator like that of CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and mass.
Not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do it, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never stand by itself on a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, you) do not.
Now, what can "bring" all this research, Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to examine any discrepancy between observations and predictions of MS.
There are many who wish to find them, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has huge deficiencies, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oops!).
But we haven't found such discrepancies at CERN so far.
Implications
The impact of this research on Mr. and Mrs. Tout-le-Monde's daily lives is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
Here: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser, in the Bell Laboratories, had no suspicion of the revolution that their work would trigger.
They were sending scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already been told by the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 - initially the laser was rather seen as a "Labo Gadget".
Imagine...
Applications can also come from the entire instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his optical work.
This sensor, although not at all its original intent, now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras in the world, and earned it the Nobel Prize in Physics 2009.
This of course does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, you never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die...
With its Commission to Die in Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is expected to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this crucial area.
The Devoir tried to look more closely at it.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that gnawed him had left him with a two-year respite.
"They gave me five years to live, I did seven years," he said, half-figue half-raisin, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois hospice home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents him from going alone to the toilet, and even eating alone.
Attached to an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even smiles, talks to strangers who work around him, bring him his medicine, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is that I be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man, it pisses up," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the house Victor-Gadbois.
Regressing at the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to accept regression," he notes.
Because, in the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor Gadbois hospice all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this point, the "team of doctors and nurses around them" no longer provides "curative" care.
For Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "conscious and suffocated".
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more wishes in life," she said, before accepting that a mask be placed on her to help her breathe.
In the next few days, however, she is waiting for a last visit from her son from Italy.
With a group of volunteers, Victor-Gadbois provides body care and food assistance.
It is palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 people.
It's very little when you know you all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, says Dr.Christiane Martel, one of the home's doctors.
Whether it is physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
If you die, you'll be willing to take care of your mouth with brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served Mr. X a beer, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the deceased's feet.
"We help loved ones as much as patients," says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow each other but do not resemble each other.
Along with an old 93-year-old man who enjoyed his last family assembly in the courtyard, well stuck in his pillows while being toasted in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically died, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after trying everything to survive.
"For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois house arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his or her life, whether at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Maison Victor-Gadbois and the Société de soutien palliativee à domicile du Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec health care that makes many physicians specialized in palliative care fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by leading figures in palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health care system is not strong enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before they agree to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency, in great pain, without being taken care of.
I'm afraid patients are only asking to die because they don't receive proper care.
And at the same time, several oncologists work on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she gave up trying chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she told me she was sorry I stopped fighting, she said.
But she told me I was done!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not having responded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Palliative Care at the Society of Home Palliative Care in Greater Montreal, patients would be resistant to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which amounts to falling asleep until the time of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Sick people who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me", it means "I want to be relieved".
This report was made possible through a Canadian Institutes of Health Research Journalism Award.
Large-Scale Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know of a formidable "system", mixing the building industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
A "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers a lot, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's curious how the system has crumbled since we took the big steps," ironically says Jacques Duchesneau, MP for Quebec City and former chief of police for Montreal.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a thorough investigation into the malfeasance related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, had consented only backwards.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, hidden party financing and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the survey in 2010, he points out, the only Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars on contracts", some rebutting their instincts to get a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he added, hoping that it will succeed in "demonstrate the stratagems behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also working with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More the policemen of the "Marteau squad" who, since 2009, have led the "cartel of sewers" of Montreal to put the gentle pedal on the swellings of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and laid charges of fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as Mayor of Laval, Quebec's third city.
He is suspected of taking bribes repeatedly in exchange for public contracts.
There are also formal charges against Montreal-based engineers and Italian-born entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the committee the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who paid the money to Union Montréal, Mayor Gérald Tremblay's party.
Mr.Zambito sowed in the 2000s, giving more than C$88,000 (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
He also admitted to having organized an illegal fundraiser for the former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts which he inflated the costs of
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked roundly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, gave a detailed report to the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totalling $736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts, the costs of which he inflated.
Other road officials confessed to getting their leg greased by inflating bills from 30% to 40%, by fake extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget feeding his caisses with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, immersing Montreal in a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected officials to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million to developers, in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, she says that she "draws on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin the wrongdoers".
The process, she says, is "sweet but positive".
We're cleaning up the wound, but we'd need a Montréal-specific investigation unit and a watch, so we don't have to see suspicious practices come back.
Just like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "chosen in the knowledge of the scheme", when they did not soak in the mess!
Estimating 70% of the dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he ironically said: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but this will not change the situation, according to him: "As long as election expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He called for a complete revision of the system of awarding public contracts and of party financing: "We cannot go any further; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will make it possible to rebuild the house on a stronger basis, with more controls and laws."
While this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I make progress by their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And in the game, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not inflamed.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training centre to my visit to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced in stages.
So you take advantage of the competition set up by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won a lot of titles with hopped clubs.
He's been with great players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a heartwarming discussion with him.
Then I came out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What look do you have at the first part of the season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as leader.
But we're still ambushed.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the club's objective in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
First we want to finish first of our hen, in front of Porto, so that we can receive on the 8th of the final return.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and register for the duration.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the MTP is providing the means for this project to materialize.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to take the title of champion.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a really big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, achieved an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
It's normal that we expect a lot from us in view of what's been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
After that, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame for, it's sure it's a bit frustrating.
We wonder what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We've proven in the Champions League that we can answer the questions.
Look at Manchester City who has not been able to qualify for the 8th finals for two seasons, they have also made huge expenses!
In view of the money invested, we imagined you with 15 points of advance to the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can have a smile by telling ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Good thing we say there's a "Zlatan addiction."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and has many goals.
He came here for this and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
He showed everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He too respects the men he has around him.
What he did was really exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I was keen to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grabbing game time.
I saw things there and I came out reinforced.
Today, I manage to make good matches in selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized with the Blues.
Lessons have been learned from what has happened in Ukraine and we must now have exemplary behaviour.
What look do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifier group for the World Cup.
The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the winner.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good draw (1-1) torn off on 16 October in Spain a founding match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never had a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite is true of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between stakeholders.
Moreover, as is often the case in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure trading protocol like BitTorrent, which allows peer-to-peer file exchange.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded with 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to 2 dollars, five months later, before coming back today around 10 dollars (prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin stands out from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to advance in a video game that you win while playing or can buy (and sometimes trade in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But each time, a central authority controls and processes trade.
With Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are both book depositors, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the same way as an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double key encryption system.
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to make sure that the bitcoins exchanged exist in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction into this book.
It involves solving a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner, a sort of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file hashing phase, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hash" the whole.
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to fraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, leaving some margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also met with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The flaw used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also mentions the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Big actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant balances" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, believes much in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus return cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
All they have to do is provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that thousands of users are available.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for bitcoin to impose itself, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, if this currency is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain ownership of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for us.
It is mainly Afghan peasants that we have punished by treating them as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse foreign armed presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, these will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done in order.
The convoys of trucks and armoured personnel joined Kabul without being attacked, flying over by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban rushing into Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood as a result of struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then seen as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants who were overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved these days.
Former Mujahedin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmen, seizing government land to sell it to refugees who had returned from Iran and Pakistan and benefited from huge American subcontracts.
They have turned their backs, and most of them have not fought themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to benefit from the American broads: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They came together with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
Government schools in cities are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that will order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and far before.
No industry has been restarted, no dams are in repair, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor has been spread that Afghanistan has immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that Westerners were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine in Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the province's largest employers.
It will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are heavily dependent, to restore normal relations.
The departure of French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: secondary school for girls, boys, department of French at university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "gain hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a "civil-military actions" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has carried out, and had carried out by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, which is greedy of local labour, has helped to contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and an increase in arable land.
What will we leave to remember, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys often located at more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, which the farmers have told me to wish for, a small, well-controlled and directly affected civilian aid should be maintained in their favour.
A Forceps Constitution in Egypt
It's a new poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, it has decided to play its game.
Taking everyone short, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State gave this House an additional two months to finish its work.
Egypt has been relying on a provisional text for almost two years, several times amended, which undermines institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "cross his word" and "peet the law".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to give up their plans to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, this is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy as the protest rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since this resort to a hasty vote is due to the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: "Whether you vote for my text, or I keep the full powers", these are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted yesterday in favour of the text.
Most Liberals were missing.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, considering that they had not been able to put forward their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society had done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added in haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it was most often unanimously that the articles were voted on.
Commentators had fun that one of the only differences of the day had been expressed around... the hour of prayer, with some members of the committee considering that the constituent pendulum was wrongly settled.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
The object of all attention, Article 2 remains finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the liberals replied, who saw only one blow of communication.
For according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
These include article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular in verifying compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is worrying because "the people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the first fruits of a theocracy."
The Liberals' fears are further compounded by the fact that the next president of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" tempers Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used borrow from religious vocabulary.
Reference is made to "fiqh" in particular [Islamic case law].
And the question might arise in the future as to to what extent civilian judges are competent to rule on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the former regime.
Another contentious point is the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will trials of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
The latter also expressed their concerns about the text, which they considered to be liberticide.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, particularly in the press.
In addition, there are no more articles that echo the protection of women, says Human Rights Watch's Heba Morayef.
In her view, the only positive point was the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was due to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
The head of state's supporters will march on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the center of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has five main reasons for going to Israel.
Go and worship the holy places
Make yourself a must: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone entering these "baptismal depths" will be touched by divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of Jesus' miracles: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he soothed the storm, or where fishing was miraculous.
It was at this precise place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
Believers travel the Rue de la Souffrance or the Way of the Cross (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This road begins near the fortress Antonia (the court), where the trial took place, then leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the Anointing and the tomb.
Here lies the Christian center of the world, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to the Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which is the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people from different faiths leave small words with prayers that are then answered.
Travel high
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, former refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 B.C. for his family.
These ruins are on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can go there by their own means.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont, which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to have once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
They could not be visited all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth a visit.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It houses the ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
Also worth seeing is the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
The paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are exhibited.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of moulds of visitors and overseers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum or Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter in total darkness.
Stars sparkle.
You then hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and welfare
Israel's three major seaside resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each offers swimming pools, water parks, delphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the temperature of the water does not fall below 21° while the temperature of the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year long.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, i.e. 417 m below sea level.
Azure-coloured water contains brine and very easily retains bathers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of surrealistic beauty.
We come to perform a treatment based on salt water, silt, curative sludge and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of Antiquity
They are guarded by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in narrow alleys that bear the name of the zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile on you.
In Jaffa you will be able to meet newlyweds who have come to make photo sessions of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk in the Roman theatre, "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, especially Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you leave for Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, because they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar equals 3.8 shekels).
As far as urban transport is concerned, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, composed of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport stop their activity.
And the work week starts on Sunday mornings.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, scaleless fish and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also humous, traditional Jewish paste, different sauces, balls of ground chickpeas, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are a lot of well-fed cats walking around in the haughty air.
We can see them at night sleeping on the roofs of the parked cars.
These felines love passing places and do not refuse to be eaten.
Car rental varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mostly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists travelled to the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011.
"Who language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
As MPs and human rights activists debate what the law on compulsory language testing will give, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families who stayed at home.
Since 1 December, a law had entered into force and stipulated that every migrant worker would have to pass a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language, but also of the history of Russia and the foundations of law, will have to be validated.
It will be necessary to validate his knowledge of Russian in order to obtain and renew his work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Persons who obtained educational certificates or diplomas prior to the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not covered by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be hosted by the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to take examinations in every city in the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already asked the question in the press many times: What will it do?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service respond, it will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery at work".
Many speak of the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the office of the Russian Federal Service for Migration in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellow men will torment him for months without food and paper and will have to work between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive numerous complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they take their passports, and they do not receive the expected salary," confirms Tolib Charipov, Head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of Tajikistan's Migration Service.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many Central Asian republic nationals who want to come to Russia to earn money say that they do not only know the language of the country to which they wish to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to attend even fair primary education.
Indeed, their families don't even have enough to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's difficult when you don't know the language, they confide.
"You feel diminished and diminished."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the Language Act.
The examinations will be intended only for migrants with legal status.
Without status, there will be no examination or formal work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or defense to come in"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then you can get a fake recording quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have a record, hence the cases of extortion.
"They're asking us for 100, 200 rubles, enough to buy cigarettes, tea," told journalists Umed Khushkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan.
"Make it quick, don't skimp and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that migrants' registration papers were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by Federal Migration Service employees.
The falsified papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: every migrant who thus hoped to facilitate the task of examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The representatives of the government and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible simply to buy these "paper tips".
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination for the first time time time to take language courses.
Moreover, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to tighten the law against the carrying of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it is the shooting at weddings or the killing organised by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to prohibit the wearing of rubber bullet weapons in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a weapons permit from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the arms law would be introduced in the State Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, demanded to abandon "this insane hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, said to the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that strengthening civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from accessing the black market.
According to them, any weapon can be found today in Moscow for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market supplies itself through several channels.
There are five main canals, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years in the Department of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking arms controls
The first is "the military trace", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians," says Baranets.
The second type of black market weapons is those stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stocks and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
The illegal pistols go for sale from the military warehouses.
Many of the latter have often experienced explosions.
"Attested versions indicate that some fires were deliberately triggered to conceal the deficit," the former military officer explains.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers have something to do with it.
"We see private arms factories that do not compete on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," one expert says.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A large proportion of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply," adds the former military.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of illegal weapons on the black market for each source.
A report on this issue was established in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analysed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data of the weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the army and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found there "because of the fault of the employees whose work is related to weapons", it is explained in the report.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from military conflict sites, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture, and 5% come from "clandestine searches".
A seller and consultant from an armoury who asked to remain anonymous ensures that for a long time no one buys the weapons found by these clandestine searchers; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, the sellers will pick up the new goods from the military warehouses.
The person buys through a sign a unit, e.g. a TT gun.
We deliver it to him by passing the goods through a fence.
"He transports it to town and sells it for 900 € per unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so, when crimes are about to be clarified, they make a purchase of control from the illegal arms dealers," adds the seller.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I consulted websites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered me to come to the Begovaya train station where someone was going to take me in a "corner" to bargain.
The price of the gun, they gave it to me on the spot.
Victor Baranets as Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the salesman. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers on the markets, but there you also have to come by saying, for example, "From such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter has lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of someone I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, according to him, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
"I thought I was in a luxury store," remembers the soldier.
There's no secret to the buyer, says Baranets, we can try anything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, we're going with the forest salesman and we're setting up a target.
"They let me shoot and when I'm convinced that the weapon works well, we start negotiating," the expert describes.
A shop from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, there is no need for any documents and no one to meet.
"It is enough to have a precise sum of money", we write in advertising on the website "Buy a gun or a combat machine gun".
Users leave their requests and ask questions.
And we sell to the miners?
"Without permission, of course", asks the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of fake sites and picks up people who want to buy combat weapons.
People rush on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia

I have heard of this type of scheme: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take the lead.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden", explains the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets states that by making a request on the site, you can find yourself unarmed and behind bars.

Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "Right to a weapon" association, one can buy a Makarov gun for 100-300 dollars.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
He was removed from the long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the Ministry's official data, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes overall decreased in Russia by 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles while the cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
USA: Employees of fast food and supermarkets on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teens go through cashier work at McDonald's
Over the past few days, a wave of protests has been mounted against the low wages of Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave is going to expand or run out quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In parallel with the increase in the modest wages received by basic employees at Walmart and in fast food chains, the organisers of the events want the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests started last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", at a time when a rain of sales grabbing millions of people fell on America and sometimes triggering skirmishes.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs to organize picket strikes with the unions and left-wing activists in the company's stores whose products are intended for consumers of the modest and middle classes.
Walmart markets everything: from diapers to hunting rifles to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many poorly paid employees at Walmart shop only at their workplace.
Price and product choice have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products, especially because of the low salaries of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of portable forklifts or scanners.
The participants of the "Black Friday" protests demanded a wage increase, they complained that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the base employee at Walmart who earns $9.5 an hour, that's an amount he can't afford.
Scientists at the California University of Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
This is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all wage increases to consumers, every race in the store would be 46 cents more.
They'll only spend $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart's supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did not harm the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in the stores from 8am to midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5000 items per second on this period.
His caisses have made a total of 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".
The spokesman for the company Dan Fogleman assured in an interview at the website on the left Huffington Post that in any case "less than five" Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a "com' operation among so many" on the part of the organizing union.
"Next client!"
The protests continued this week in New York City and were not about Walmart stores (in this progressive city they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet located there) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-foods are increasing over time, but on average, their base employees are getting $8.90 an hour in New York.
No one touches less than them in this town.
For me it's inconceivable to live with that money in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum there are comments that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast food be paid at least $15 an hour, a multiplication more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing trade union protesters through bullying or dismissal.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, grabbing fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the most important is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree.
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the rally in the middle of the day near McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several local democrat policies, including that of Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly!".
The protesters were supported by other New York Democrats in view, notably by Mayor Bill De Blasio's candidate who said that "we all need to support fast food workers so that they get a fair salary and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the most important event in the fast food industry in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated and not all of them were fast-food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
For the moment it is difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
"At the moment, we only manage to deceive the brain moderately"
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to seeing augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November we learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it appears from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already of ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to widen the boundaries of this interaction.
For the time being, humanity as a whole has remained on flat screen pixels and sometimes on touchscreen.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in ordering by gesture.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although the Kinect has made the physical interaction, many things happen on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information entry has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance at this time, not really.
We are trying to change this and we are working on truly 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out of ours, into the physical world, to make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the surrounding space.
Thus, we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
It is appreciated, but is it not overestimated?
It cannot be said that this is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of his actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-held bracelet recording the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to put this can on?
You would do it with words and gestures.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or won't do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like about modern cameras?
They lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, adding work to algorithm designers.
We must keep in mind the resolution according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, of our Redmond laboratory, gave the sensor touch a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 μs, the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device of this type in my work, but not having to touch, to have more frames on the second.
- But shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define the locations.
- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around all the time with a smartphone with your hands up is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be an augmented reality "transitional" that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and that is what makes them strong (the personal elements are the ones you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is only accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to mere mortals.
There is one problem that opponents of this idea point to: there is no tactile sensation!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image carrier.
She's recording pressure perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the fingertips.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also an axis of work with perspectives.
- And you tried to deceive the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still one task below which it will take a long time to get hurt: the way to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that he is walking in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the moment, we can only manage to deceive the brain moderately, there are still many years of work left.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The peterbourgeois avant-garde" dedicated to the city's people who are in advance, the avant-garde of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the art scene of St.Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city border and who have found recognition in Europe, after having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extrovert painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that you can meet near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in the trendy parties and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather crowds, regardless of where they are exhibited.
He is one of the peterbourgeois storytellers, fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the peterbourgeois avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took a Barbarian organ in his hands and became the symbol of this instrument in St.Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role because of its existence, philosophy and image as a Bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you travel the city all red and not yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a fashion designer specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not grey causes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Cultural Palace where my works were located.
I realized it was my way.
So, the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new ones, free, like me, were misunderstood.
I began to be friendly with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina which gave birth to "Puchinskaya-10" and then there was no wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
- It was important for me to be in the centre of St. Petersburg culture where the best creative forces must gather.
In 1995, I took my place in Pushkinskaya-10 which housed before the works a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the peterbourgeois bohemian.
Many were born there: The NAMEs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arriving with the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in play-back in tight jerseys, they included Igor Vdovin, composer today fashionable.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg played a lot of shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that's when his great career began, but his training and his basic education, it was at home that he received them.
Galerie "D137", Club "Gridoïedov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees went there as regulars.
I'm a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named Painter of the Year, and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very topicality and a strong acuity.
I'm going to have a planned exhibition "The Russian Museum Through Clowns."
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it's afraid of being like this.
But with clowns, everything fades, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we have to spit him out.
And the lie will be erased by the disguise.
Recently we saw you in the role of the organ player of Barbary.
Who other than me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today, commercial art must be cared for, delicate, liquid.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into herds, bohemians loved one thing, denied another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw away who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and in the end it's less management, less money, everything dies.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with paintings that usually are the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money precisely for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the reign of the good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand the culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow today there are good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are out of the way, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and pave the way for them.
At the moment, it is the "regne of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- What do you think St. Petersburg is?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for that.
And on our stones, art has a hard time pushing.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions and concerts.
In our house, this layer is very thin.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Delivering in Space
Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with Earthmen on board set out to search for a rescue planet.
In order to save humanity, a great question arises: how can we continue to live our species in weightlessness or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
"It's Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the surface temperature of Venus is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitudes or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, we were experimenting on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from earth varieties.
Then we put in orbit insects, small breeding drosophilic flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to see how an embryo was developing in weightlessness.
We get a perfectly normal chick at the exit.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a support, he has to get on his feet and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By not finding any support, the chicks were agitated in a disorderly manner.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophying.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
"We shook their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature arch" with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the "Bion" biosatellite will only ship species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"They were still biosatellites and then it's the only experiment. We have to do this kind of research," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions are not yet possible directly in space.
It's no small deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike beasts, man is capable of it, in principle.
Homo sapiens possess abstract thought, he is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
This type of experiment is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the feminine organism is what humanity has most precious.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could say if it would stand after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the robbery.
"No one answered this question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadze, retired from the rocket and space sectors.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been in orbit twice and even working in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts that have had nothing and that give birth to healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it poses a danger even during orbital flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train for extra-vehicular outputs.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults, the water is comfortable but however a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Little amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby progresses about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's stomach, it is easier to get used to water.
This is logical in principle, because from his birth until his first bath, it happens only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a weight force.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, of the pelvis atrophy very quickly, the ability of the baby to push is lost.
All right, let's ignore that by using birth simulators.
Of course we can prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will manage to get him out.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite reflection on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the Earth's attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or muscle system.
You can't dress an infant like an adult with a special combination for workouts.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experiment that we would consider in this case imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely maladapted", foresees the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a theory.
However, with time this will become a reality, when the Earthlings travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their descendants born in space.
The head of the ISC (Superior Institution of Control of Public Finance) said: "The control of pseudo self-employment (in Czech " Švarc system ") failed because of politicians.
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is lagging behind in its implementation.
This is what Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Higher Audit Institution, said in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in us," Kala said in her comment on the current situation.
A joint monitoring by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice Petr Nečas' approach to the "Švarc system".
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that the ODS was not going to bother contractors with controls, so is it allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it forbids something, even the head of government cannot prevent an inspection authority from acting to demand compliance," Kala says.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project in which the public procurement legislation of these two countries was compared.
What was the concrete question?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for the way in which public procurement and specific national legislation and practice follow it.
We have gathered all this together and although this monitoring procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "more stringent and of better quality", nevertheless, according to certain parameters, practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continually develop increasingly detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote itself to the very implementation of the law.
How can this project help you concretely and what does it result for you?
Common control of this kind should help us stop trying to clarify laws, lower and improve thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering market thresholds will not necessarily achieve this goal.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by red tape that those looking for loopholes will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our SAI or a different method of organization?
As far as the institutions are concerned, as in the case of the SAI, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised in a similar way, also has a council set up a little differently, but these two institutions basically proceed in a similar way.
The competences are also, to a certain extent, similar, however, with a nuance vis-à-vis our system: since Germany is a federal structure, it therefore also has such prices of accounts at the level of the various Länder.
The ORH can only control federal money, which in our case corresponds to the resources of the state.
The public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the Länder's accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it does better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better detectives?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I don't have any comparative data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we see as a model, is also faced with a whole range of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has been meant for you, as an institution, by the amendment of the law on public procurement, are its effects already being felt?
As this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our control operations.
As we carry out post-audits, there is a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the time being, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument of "detection of the risks of mismanagement" with which we have screened nearly 14 000 public contracts - there these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions for certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law to be more of an advantage or an additional burden on the administration?
I believe that this legislation is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and cannot be respected.
Already under the previous regulations, the provider (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the contract law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal mistakes without affecting the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on administration.
So what's the solution to get out of this?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the SDO was not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it forbids something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect and demanding compliance with the law.
He can say: "We will change the law and allow it", but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing happened.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder should be eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that, in my opinion, is what is lacking in us.
The roads are frozen in places, but most remain practicable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snow-covered.
However, the network remains largely practicable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary area, the roads were this morning practicable, but in frozen places and also snow-covered.
Temperatures have fallen and range from -5 ° to -10 °C but are expected to rise slightly during the day.
Snowfall has stopped in the area and only a thin layer of snow remains on the plains.
The ridges of the Metalliferous Mountains (Krušné hory) are covered by about 30 centimetres of snow.
The data from the regional road maintenance service show that, due to fog, visibility was reduced in places.
The R6 expressway and the region's national roads are now easily accessible.
However, vigilance remains to be exercised, for example on certain bridges whose surface can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also feasible.
Some of their sections still have frozen snow left over and in places full of traffic.
Especially in areas above sea level, drivers need to be more vigilant.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Highways and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in Eastern Bohemia are threatened by the formation of ice, and that traffic-packed snow can be found on roads in mountainous areas and at high altitudes.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in areas of the Pardubice area at altitude.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on the departmental and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kn+nou and Trutnov, a layer of traffic-tackled snow is present on roads in areas above sea level.
In Eastern Bohemia it will be dry today, most often clear, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a weak wind and temperatures will generally oscillate between -3 ° and +1 °C.
Pilsen region
Roads in the Pilsen area are now feasible, although there is a need for increased vigilance and adaptation to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures vary between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communication routes may be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to cross areas of fog, however visibility will gradually improve.
This is reflected in the information provided by the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is almost easy to operate, but road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The surface of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the South Pilsen District and in the Tachov District.
The departmental and third category lanes are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers need to be vigilant, especially on less busy roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc region
Drivers travelling to areas of the Olomouc region at altitude must now count with a thick and soft layer of snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" pass and on the road towards Videlský k
The snowfall forced the road maintenance personnel to go to the field this night; according to the road services, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of Šumperk.
In the other parts of the region, most roads are easily accessible.
" On the heights of the district of Šumperk are snow remains.
Drivers travelling towards Jeseník should expect to meet a thick and soft layer of snow at the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" pass today told ČTK the head of road maintenance services in the Šumperk district.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also visited the area during the night; according to them, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are easily accessible, however in the district of Šternberk drivers should pay attention in sections in forest areas to the roads that remain humid.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, maintenance services on the northern Bohemian roads reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some areas covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, and therefore snow and ice are expected to remain on the roads. On the plains, especially in the southeast of the Central Plateau of Bohemian, there are no problems, on the contrary, and roads are generally dry.
No traffic problems have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice, particularly in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snowmelt during the day, clear sky and freezing during the night.
From the main traffic routes, there are also difficult conditions on national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees which have bent under the weight of snow until reaching the roadway.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
It's just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our band The Tap Tap, we laugh about it and we think that we are the only group able to collect a positive balance of energy in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you set up a very unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
It is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end almost at the end of the Mayan calendar on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, over a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who had that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world entitled "End of the World Cancelled " (in Czech " Konec světa zrušeno ").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will it be heard also during these charity concerts?
Of course, at the end, at last, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in all three concerts.
The anthems will also join at some point as part of a very unique live broadcast on Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tom+ Hanák who also holds the leading role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X sings there as well...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize numerous concerts and charity events...
We strive to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world be for?
To equip the Studeo training centre, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on as part of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit students of the Jedličkūv Institute and offer them activities that interest and amuse them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Several music groups and performers will be on stage at each of these concerts?
By what criteria do you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustrator with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji
Full details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the Prague spring, and here too we will certainly prepare a quality programme with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the Czech Republic's house in New York and personally, once we're there in the United States, I'd like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not that bad that it looks at first sight.
We have five members in electric wheelchairs whose vehicles have to travel in the hold, naturally we also carry a lot of luggage and instrument boxes....
So far everything has gone more or less well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that in the east all are still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to travel alone in electric wheelchairs in the centre of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there, too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities is being created.
How do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to note that improvements and refinements continue to depend on the efforts of the individuals concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on this point you, The Tap Tap, are on the contrary at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and ease of access are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers among us.
For the time being, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this band?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by a lot of young people willing to get involved in something.
And since I myself am a musician (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a musical activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator, Angelovič, says, we have lost a little control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I'm not mistaken?
It's true that creating connections with known singers and actively working to promote the band helped us.
We understood that if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to the European Union's grants, we can also afford to have quality teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you aim to achieve such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was potential for change.
The show business is full of stuff that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts for a long time.
Few are the original projects, and I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it's natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with a disability are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, whom we must take pity.
They are people who can live a life in their own right and thrive, provided they have the necessary means, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities can achieve something, it is not only a step forward for them but for the whole society.
Isn't your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we are to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and demand some discipline.
But I think it's quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, L·a Angelovič.
We're an open group, people go in and out, there's nothing we can do about it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would want to join us.
This will be the case the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, Brno in Fleda and Ostrava in the Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when the song of the band The Tap Tap "End of the World Cancelled " will be sung together.
The purpose of the concert is to bring together financial resources (up to CZK 25 million) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training centre located in Prague in the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years old, pre-sale tickets are open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was admitted as 20th member of the Agency, it is the second member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed participated in a number of the Agency's projects.
However, Poland's journey to space began much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, at which he presented ideas from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr.Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his work "Introduction à l'astronautique".
Dr.Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagator of the world-renowned astronautic, his contribution was especially rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the Moon.
As early as 1925, a draisine was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket should be used to propel or brake the draisine.
The only known information about this draisine is that of the press of the time.
Starting in 1933, Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was carried out by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
The documents kept show that this research had reached the testing stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search stopped.
In 1937, plans for a photoelectric hunting rocket, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietoobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all plans for the use of rocket technology were carried out by the provisional scientific advisory committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war put an end to its activities.
After the war, further work on aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is a company in the November 1954 issue of Problem, in which four more detailed articles on aeronautics are published.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the international Astronautical Federation (created in 1951) and in the autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently an improved version was built, RM-1A, and during the summer of 1959 tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were started in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket was 1.4 metres long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and should have been used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded the first RM rockets.
This rocket, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they distinguished themselves by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space offering a volume of 0.4 liter, while in Meteor-1B the volume was 0.34 liter and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liter.
The maximum range of all these types of gear was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the Aeronautical Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were later built.
Poland's entry into the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later are worth mentioning.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this programme.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision raised a lively debate in the public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberalist-oriented economic systems, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means in concrete terms that the different economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour prices (wages) create a pressure on prices.
The meaning of the term is as follows: a producer tries by importing goods sold at low prices to resist economic competition by "making the price of the competitor more expensive", with the aim of removing a greater share of the market and thus increasing its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, buying cheaply or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the State's social charges necessarily increase.
This whole situation is intensifying the perfect unwillingness of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
Unscrupulous practices of private capital create a situation in the different economies in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to their homes.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to existing laws.
The aim is to force its own population economically to accept the diktat of private capital prices, especially in the area of wages.
This is due, on the one hand, to a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, to the restriction of workers' rights in the field of labour legislation.
The result is growing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, for years there have been public food distribution points for the poor who cannot support themselves with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the State is forced to pay a supplement to reach the minimum subsistence level.
Such a scandal has been brought to light, for example, in the case of employees working as auxiliaries to the federal parliament.
The economic measures of almost all the southern EU Member States undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as in the 19th century) or to live with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
The question here is: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will change from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or then a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media claim that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory intervention.
We must then ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence and, even, does not control today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same token, the entire state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The evidence is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the drafting of legislation to law firms closely linked to industry.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
The totality of power does not come from the people, as Western constitutions state, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberalist-oriented democracies are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Times of Caesar and Pompey": "The State had long since been in disrepair and functions were attributed by violence.
The bribes, the favours obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The under-tables and corruption were proliferating without limits and the people were going to the elections with already sold votes" ... ... "The honest people were not trying to get jobs, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls". ... "It was really beginning to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that one had to choose an energetic man" ... It is true that Appianos had Pompey in mind, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interest of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and asserting the interests of society as a whole.
Today, as in the past, the result is an unprecedented decadence of elites, without any effort to carry out profound reforms.
We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the present state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a sort of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises that we are witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from past and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and internally, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen the state's capital investment in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will," says Sting in the song entitled Fragile, whose main verse of the chorus is "don't forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons didn't want wars, there wouldn't be wars," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, there have been many reactions.
Some take the side of Israel, asserting its right to self-defence and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is a victim in its waves of recurrent killings; all in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a view located "behind the curtain", on the one to which mainly benefit from the tensions that have already persisted for more than 95 years (from the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others emerge from my own understanding of the one, or more precisely the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At each time, we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individualities acted independently or whether they owed their actions to the throne to someone who directed their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We have to admit that we are living in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers could not be achieved over a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
As early as the 19th century, they acquired the first worldwide news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their names and serious criminal acts in which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortune or both.
They own major holdings in almost most of the world's central banks and prepare or wage wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only of 4, in the meantime Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew to the Rothschild Bank of America the status of central bank and began to issue his own money during the civil war (I understand it) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to sue the EDF for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a freemason initiated in the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The purpose of the first war was to eliminate Europe's great state monarchies, the second was to suppress colonialism, particularly British colonialism, and the third was to reduce the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a large quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and ultimately acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families headed by the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the EDF intended to prevent crises such as those they caused in 1907 from recurring).
After having succeeded in unleashing the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir Habsburg to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers allowed politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed fierce war reparations on Germany thus generating the conditions for radicalisation of the impoverished masses (they then had to place a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing at the guilty, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia made up of different nationalities, including a strong German minority which had to play the role (which it actually held) of the fifth column to set fire to the powders and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had broken the chains in which the international bankers had originally held him; or whether everything he had done was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel lit a fire pit that could cause a third world war.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong causes another wrong according to an endless circle of violence and where, at the origin of everything, there is the greed of certain individuals and their desire to gain power over the whole world?
Here we have to distinguish between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as in our home, international bankers only propose to people in elections their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything in order to trigger a war with Iran, which could, because of that country's membership in the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz through which 20% of all world oil flows (this naval corridor has a width of only 2 miles) and leads to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light now appear the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every new born is implanted at birth an electronic chip making it a totally controlled being.
"Let them compel all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to wear on their hands or foreheads a mark with red iron, so that they may neither buy nor sell one who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that he who has common sense counts the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number designates the man and it is six hundred and sixty six."
The film Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters composed of Islamic students stormed the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not give the US administration a positive outcome, it could not abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, a blow further aggravated by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The sequestered diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate stirred up a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle strongly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered America a small victory.
Just before she was busy, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated events, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran with a rocky cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who came to make scouts for the shooting of a science fiction show.
Combination of genera
Exfiltration expert Tony Mendez's plan required Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
On the one hand, it is a political thriller designed realistically but also a "caper movie", the account of a successful blow, a treachery - like, for example, in the Ocean's eleven, Twelve and Thirteen trilogy.
The atmospheres follow each other: sequences of Tehran in documentary style (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and the way in which, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no great differences),
lighter parts of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
And then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting game stopped generating ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It's also Affleck's first film that doesn't take place in his home town, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where Tehran's role "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity which also suggests confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in fictional scenes (the fake shooting team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director must have contented himself with a subject that in fact offered few thrilling scenes, in the cinematic sense of the term.
He does quite well, he sometimes adds some elements to reality and there the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is ruled out by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the airstrip is quite drawn by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he lets himself be seen with moderate interest, enjoying the realization and retro style of the 70s.
He trains the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a history still, in a certain way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omnicious, it does the job.
Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipopoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry into the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU has recently been considering adopting a quota of 40 per cent of women for the management of large European companies has been at the root of our decision," said the newspaper Právo, the organiser of this survey, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned are already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, however, women have been advantaged in terms of life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lesser risk to insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013", informed Nacher.
Among the controversial EU regulations are, for example, the requirement to add organic components to fuels, which has adverse consequences for the environment, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, solely because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance or the Directive on the size of hens cages, which has led to an increase in egg prices.
Criticism has also been expressed in the past against the de facto prohibition of the use of the term "butter to spread" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimetres.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of states (e.g. the Czech Republic is currently imposing the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto power).
The interests of pressure groups are also responsible, for example, for the fact that bananas in the Union must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curve".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was simply harmonising non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite opposition from some States, claiming that existing guidelines result in food wastage.
The first prize may be awarded in this investigation to last year's EU regulation requiring that a warning be placed on inflatable balloons that children under 8 years of age should not inflate without adult surveillance.
The EU referred to an American survey according to which balloons are the leading cause of child death from suffocation among toys.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when blowing in fair trumpets.
We have weird ideas in our home too.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is rather absurd: because of the sensitivity of this topic to Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and should instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the liberal economists' association "Laissez Faire", the Bankovnípoplatky.com server named in this survey, in addition to some absurdities mentioned above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then, for example, exceeded the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and, as a result, risked a heavy fine.
The organisers of the survey found the idea of paying money to certain countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to apply for subsidies to be interesting.
These ideas, however, do not originate from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea handicaps us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund." In autumn 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) said.
He argued that, as a result of our wheat production, and following so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks that it had to export afterwards.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to Czech demand and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for obtaining grants were proposed to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which were to be used in concrete terms to draft applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "Weird regulations are rare".
While regulations are often criticized by many experts in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning and its overall development are rather commendable.
More serious, for example, is, according to experts, the problem of using EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but have been imposed by the Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (which it does not always win) arouses strong emotions among Czechs.
If, after six years of fighting against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs have successfully defended the name "Olomucké tvar+ky", for what of the name "Tuzemskýrum" that dates back to us in the nineteenth century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only cane sugar alcohol products, not beet sugar products, may bear the name rum.
The official list of EU registered products now includes world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck's marzipan or Parma's ham, Karlovy Vary's cookies ("Karlovarské sochary"), Pohořelice's and Třebo's carps ("Pohořelický a Třebořský kapr") and Žatec's hop ("Žatecký chmel").
The Pardubice gingerbread ("Pardubický perník") and the cakes called "Hořice cornets" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their Community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura.
Senator, how does it feel to run for president?
It is not being a senator or chair that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn't be a candidate anywhere.
But I can't stand seeing how the country has been looted for the past twenty years, that thieves are not under lock and call and taxes and the retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I try to find a way to change it.
And since I am more than forty years old and I am independent, a member of no party, I have no other way to influence the situation than to run for office in the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but quickly set out for the Castle (N.d.T.: seat of the presidency).
Don't you turn your back on those who elected you?
I've always said that I'll start the battle for the Castle according to the results of the senatorial elections.
Later, I said that if I was elected as a senator, I would run for president.
My purpose is not the function, it is only an instrument for me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we grumble at the bar or in front of our television station, but also that we trample on those who try to bring change.
To this is added the press that breaks people's reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I have been told that I bribe journalists or that I have been the advisor to Ji ' Parubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You started the fight for the Castle with as a battlehorse the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax declarations beyond twenty million [of CZK].
To that end, you must change the law.
As Speaker, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I lobbied for tourism guides to be a liberal profession, I won.
The problem is politics: when someone arrives from the left or right with a good project, it is deliberately refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without partisan categorization and dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
You think you're more like a man on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are putting me on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we're moving forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right, but that people are gathered together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS, and I also act impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you're a populist?
But doesn't what you said prove that?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have spoken about them.
But without the support of parliament, all you have left is slogans.
You won't survive long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I must convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my side in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then eventually explain why they don't want it.
When there is a strong personality who will identify abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the election of the president by direct vote, it was obtained thanks to pressure from public opinion.
I admit, unmistakably, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I have just entered politics and I am trying to get the support of the majority for my programme.
I'm trying to move things forward on my own, and if it doesn't work out, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can't make a difference, and that's why I went to see a number of personalities and asked them to run for the Senate election as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the fuel oil fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty per cent of the people did not vote, and what did, for the most part, gave their votes to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that will hardly be able to impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and regional prefects.
Are you planning to form your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to see if the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I don't have any money for my presidential campaign either, I only have twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property at about 60 million.
I have in Prague a plot worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving in the car, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You're riding in Aston Martin, you have a fortune worth 60 million and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I've already invested two and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program does not attract much interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign in my own pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live with it, for example, paying my son's English school for 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I won't run for office.
So you're going to continue your business activities so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd be deafening your activities?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take over the direction of the travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I was winning and I keep winning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I'd end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV firm prove that true adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To convince oneself of this, just contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a large neighboring company, tells us: "Yes, it is indeed beautiful, this building".
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
Today, no one goes of their own free will to one of these rincade libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that has nothing to appeal to the gates of Rotterdam, has a rather special record.
The commune of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brains, the city decided a few years ago to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro notes in the form of pretty small miniatures of painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
Thus, the city authorities realized that there was only one way to regain control over statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, of the architect's office in Rotterdam MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of buildings full of mind and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and presented himself to the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a snitch on his face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at each other, disconcerted and shrugging their shoulders, Maas, the dismayed one, stacked his books of choice in order of size to make them a pyramid, and ended his speech supported by militant arguments by a: "common heart!"
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the €30 million mountain sprang from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project including an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a few adjoining buildings and houses for a total of 50 dwellings.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, this dull little town, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a town hall of a staggering ugliness, whose white facades invite to think that they are home to a dairy, has been enriched by a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Certainly, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open to you when you walk the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant reverbers speak unequivocally the language of the municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We're already looking at public benches, dogs and little boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally, library shelves are located along the façade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," says Willy Maas.
We have completely changed the classical spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from inside to outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been elegantly designed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the centre for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes panellings, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircase ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the hardened building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
One day we found in a Frisian farm an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, synthetic membranes of one millimetre thickness have been used as substrates in greenhouses and fields for years.
It's cheap and we save time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into four centimetres thick plates.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 meters, the literary café offers a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and potted ficus.
They create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity in the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the new soul
"It's incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in the field of ecology," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is controlled by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only illuminates the interior for a short time, even on beautiful days.
The thick wooden beams mounted across the glass façade serve as a sun visor, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The ambient atmosphere is very pleasant.
The completely automated blinds handle the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "found soul".
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure made it possible to fill the gaps in the library which was not yet fully stocked (today, it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
This is how MVRDV reached the master discipline that is called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
Even though she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans need to play a bigger role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request for observer State status at the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must exercise caution because it has special relations with Israel.
But I also believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but was not too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 insurgency in Libya, Germany also chose to abstain in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany have any difficulty in adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy as defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore clashed with several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to find this role, but are on the road to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
What, then, does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for Germans?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including on national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the Middle East conflict and its abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany first has important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to clash with public opinion, but also with the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a determining factor.
However, I would not place too much emphasis on it, because it is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a determining factor in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany undermine its relations with the United States by opting for abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I believe that the fracture is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will be even more respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly demonstrating a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you observe the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm for Netanyahu's policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think that makes it easy for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
That is what they are currently doing about the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will take on a role as a locomotive in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been a delicate one.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that is more marked by their independence.
Does Germany see itself as a major player on the international stage, and does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or does she still have difficulty taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still finds it difficult to play a more important role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
In fact, it's always the same problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to deal with a wide variety of neighbours and opinions, and it's not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is diminishing, but at the moment the EU is not filling this void, so who remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're less appreciated, it's life!

"Trademark protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name is an officially registered trademark in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the company bearing its name cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, it is not certain that she would win the case.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, lawyer for Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in violating property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators need only a few additional letters to register their trademarks.
So instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods.
Pattloch opens a workbook containing the registrations made at the Beijing Trademark Office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company filed the trade mark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become world champions of copying and infringement of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell virtually nothing but counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his constituents charge him with tackling the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a relative brand.
The term is derived from Bang Dakuan.
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are referred to.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame for.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is huge."
The financial losses and legal costs amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to expensive flagship products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest growing one.
However, it is not easy to remove questionable registrations from the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch refers to the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time the criticized name had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains to us that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist because he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump producer Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's acquirer, used before a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW's. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the plagiarists of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO trademark office in Beijing admits that it experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office would have passed last year from an "emergency situation in the course of work to a recovered normality".
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22%.
Almost 57,000 cases of this type were reported to have been closed, an increase of 75% over the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 proceedings remain outstanding at the Office.
It's expensive to take action.
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office would have recorded 1.8 billion yuan of registration fees.
In other words, each record yielded an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Of course, the Germans were able to obtain that the illegal manufacture of vehicle components was suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
"It's our fault, because last names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office had therefore rejected the objection of the Munichers.
Freudenberg has certainly won the case in the following two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is in order
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "The procedure is long, difficult and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to estimate internal costs. The archives department has even had to review the acts of the last 100 years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg even offered the opposing party in vain a "large sum in six-digit euros" to settle the dispute.
"That's what we see for ourselves," Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East threaten even to spill over to Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region ensured the exploitation of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file Freudenberg's name for a shoe and leather production company in Germany.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but could still have prevented the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "vigilance is in order".
Pattloch and he advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, in their view, to rely on international trademark law, that foreigners should rather "register also in China everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay licence fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland rejoice at their coming.
This is the story of a link that crosses far more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First of all, we hit our feet: cowboy boots, sneakers, women's escarpins and men's moccasins seek the rhythm by hitting the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers grow slowly - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they get carried away, bewitch and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost loses his canvas shoes when he directs the orchestra with his wildly flexible gestures.
It's Monday night, the Imbongi choir repeats a new song in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years of age have come, from geneticist in human medicine to man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, every singer has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa and parts of Swaziland.
To be helped to help each other
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are infected with the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany through the "Voices for Africa" association.
70 of them attend secondary schools.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a godfather.
This money guarantees the child money for the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo centre.
Imbongi means in Zulu "storyteller" or "singer of praise".
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this region, but all can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign language that she brought to Germany to now return it to her native region: South Africa.
Because at 8,733 kilometers as the bird flies from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of straw or land and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has taken away their parents.
In Esitjeni, we can see on a smaller scale the ills that afflict Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population hardly ever accepts male circumcision, a measure that guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population is infected with the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in spring 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis mainly saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is simply no perspective.
At first, they were only a few people who personally committed themselves to paying a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since been almost professional in the care of the AIDS orphans of Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The pubic lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STIs.
Which groups are primarily concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhea often occur in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is responsible for at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections are among young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany, human papillomavirus is common among young people.
What is the trend in the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure has risen from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has declined.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one-tenth over the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white loss, pain in the lower abdomen as well as the appearance of buds and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through lubricating infection or close bodily contact.
Experts therefore recommend that any person who often changes sexual partners take regular examinations.
Most rapidly detected STIs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds raised by the singers through their voices throughout Germany, the means are accumulating.
"In all, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well housed, for example in one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, so called the old Zulu women, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them welcome up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and ensure that they go to school every day on time in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed in a safe place, in Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chicken coops. With the help of the American health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many inhabitants.
This is not self-evident, for even if the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a taboo," explains Annette Lennartz, "because it's a subject that touches sexuality."
It is rather curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned customs, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
However, condoms are found in every corner of the street," adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote some cultural exchange, Imbongi's choirs travel together every two or three years to the South of Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still experience during the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in the African language is a sign of recognition such that it not only generates good humour and joy, but sometimes also tears out a few formidable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the choirs visit their godson.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there," say the people there.
And after a trip of 8,733 kilometers as a bird flies back to Heidelberg, in front of those singers who tapped their feet in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Straße, there is also light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of ice on planet Mercury.
The ice layer could be 20 metres thick.
The American space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of an ice cover in the region of the planet that is constantly diving into the shadows.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimetres up to 20 metres.
The water probably comes from comets or maybe asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one links the discovery of water to the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other life-critical elements have arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Unseen of the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like small interstices through which one observes infinity.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "new-born" in the delivery room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope has discovered this region where stars are born, called "W5", a name not very romantic, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flamboyant glow of a star dying.
The donut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the huge Trifide nebula, at 5,400 light years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
Pleiades, clusters of stars also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope enhances colour.
In this infrared photo, Helice's nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
His resemblances to a land continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo allows to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest riddles of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
Depending on the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the trifide nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light years away.
Trifide's name comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), for three dust drags divide the glowing heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation of the Serpentary: 400 million light-years from the Earth, the nuclei of two molten galaxies rush to each other, collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Southern Fire Wheel".
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a detail of the Iris nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light years old and consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than the common domestic dust.
This photo was developed from optical and X-ray photographs taken by different telescopes.
It shows the circle composed of black holes which is located 430 million light years from the Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette nebula, also permanently create young stars at 5,000 light years from the Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists think he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was largely composed of hydrogen.
Our View of the Universe: The Main Telescopes
The telescope was allegedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter still reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the method of economic construction is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also attached to the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great capacity to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help with the "Search for Extraterrestral Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by using the computing power of his machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The construction of a European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take photographs before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A huge new telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows us to admire it.
However, the most important space images come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, he has been giving us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope's mission will be to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that Mercury's South Pole is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data showed the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
With the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists are now certain.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is a complete romanticism.
At the bend of the many turns of the road, the small bus cahoots along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
It's all green and fertile, it's almost like the Black Forest.
But here we are in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group, called Talysh, lives, about which we do not know much, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azeri and that they have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small plastronne town with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not at all agree with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one lane.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, 48-year-old Pilata Fatulayeva is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva explains.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
We can discover the lives of about eight dozen Talysh of the region who are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather. He's 120 years old.
Have another child at 136 years old
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
There is, however, no birth certificate.
And when one thinks that the oldest person documented was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems more than dubious.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man allegedly married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a daughter.
Would Şirali Müslümov have been wrong for a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of man in the middle of Central Asia.
"Amazingly old people also live in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the lack of documentation, and there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
However, people in the Lerik area often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
What, then, is the reason for longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the museum's director, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink daily a glass of melted butter, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village close to the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a bar, whose content she beats tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two little kids are also swarming in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical armadus glasses in the shape of a belly.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf hide long braids of a dark blond that his son reveals with pride.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and they kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never bought any food in a supermarket in my whole life.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the lead.
The language of propaganda is astounding in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who has led his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, after which his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats (about the same amount as in euros) monthly for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-grey son is right: "the elders enjoy great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "human rights" omitted from the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Competitor demonstrations reveal the deep fracture of the country.
The draft constitution based on Sharia law is violently controversial.
The Egyptian President is not stupefying with words full of emotion.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was intended for the entire people, but also especially for the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and lay people.
Because all members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost by apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his powers "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer wants to save, who holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 hastily written articles by the majority Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour night tour of power are indeed disturbing to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that case law is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
This was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal leeway to apply a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
In any case, it suggests a newly introduced article stipulating that, with regard to all matters relating to Sharia, al-Azhar University should be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance radiates on all the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will supervise the legislature, which would de facto lead to the guardianship of the judiciary.
Many points in the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is the probable maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts tried to suppress opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The project also states that the State must protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that State institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
In short, it would simply be censorship.
In addition, there is no article that expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a cartoon of the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a man of law?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft which Morsi put to the vote and which, in his own words, will be "very soon" the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution Reborn"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual harmony on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down the sharia before it came into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the dustbins of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of trying to foment a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," exclaimed Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated," said Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its nullity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of Cairo University.
The veiled women and the supporters of the Salafists, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean up our country!" they asked Morsi, saying that "the Qur'an [was] their Constitution."
A fight for sovereignty over the symbolic place Tharir, where everything began, would soon have produced a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, this is what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that opponents of the draft Constitution, along with its supporters, had spoken loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot box what direction the country should take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process, which should have lasted until February and encompass all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or before the courts under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights were indivisible.
That is why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets in his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant breaches of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto takes away all his powers," Saeda said.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels left behind, including by the international community, who looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could be paid for.
A protestant in Tharir Square warns: "You give birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway's rakfisk: is it the most fragrant fish in the world?
The five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to local appetite for an extremely fragrant fish?
Have some advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty soccer clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt sprinkled trout and fermented in water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can last up to a year.
When the darkness settles and it's cold, Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," explains Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time firefighter who is also known as "Rakfisk General", responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people get small pieces of fish and get a lot of drink.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," Havard adds.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid putting it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in airtight water barrels, then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, when well fermented, the fish came out and - without a doubt with the senses diminished by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians had been forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is regarded as something important, a vital, though fragrant, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to displease it.
Here, people are unwilling to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about "the incident of July 22".
The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country one of them was able to commit such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has owed its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the unique reason for our success," explains Anna, our waitress, with blonde hair and the eyes of a piercing blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a tray of rakfisk in her hand.
We are - how do you say - cautious people.
His English, like most people who live here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw money out of the window, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep its purse cords tight.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Not forgetting the rakfisk," she adds in a careless laughter.
I stand under the snow and line up to buy something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a burger made of elk, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I stay in is one of many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most fragrant of them.
There's a TV show where the presenter wears a bow tie, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It's like the Eurovision contest.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of the fish emanations.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, is interested in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, which are numerous.
Road traffic in Mexico City is currently particularly poor.
In a city where traffic jams are widespread in normal times, a safety dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the objective was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, from the results of outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Pena Nieto was the governor of the state of Mexico before joining the U.S. president.
A very populated and sprawling state that engulfs the capital. On its favourite land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic commune of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in everyone's memory.
The premises attribute it to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the commune.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once bumped and full of crevices.
Plates bearing its name are hung outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to make lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and the party of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy, in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years of unfailing power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the critics of opponents who accuse the new president of lacking charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he can listen.
However, this is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more obvious.
Hidden under the autoponents of the highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called to the rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the past two years have been found on the edge of the dump.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place sadly famous for the number of innocent women killed there.
The critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to stem the problem of murders against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version refers to a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says the Señora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the cadaveric rigidity was already started.
While her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross where the word: Justice appears.
However, this is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old gossiper, a troublemaker, a whining woman.
They want us to accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it's not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised that he will make it his priority during his term of office.
"I hope he will be as good as he was as a president when he was governor," Olvera told Congressman Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, state the prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the allegations of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning was subjected to during detention.
The trial concerns Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to close the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of causing the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. Army -- missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claimed to have suffered during his military detention.
During cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein stated that recordings of weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a motion demanding that the Manning case be closed on the grounds that the kidnapping took place in very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified that he wanted to commit suicide while in detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
During Friday's hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had filled out after meeting Manning, during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein spoke about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment his guards had given him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had received in the prison was "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about certain problems orally and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the problems mentioned.
"They wrote "no problem" (after addressing the concerns), but that didn't mean I didn't raise any problems," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military stated that they assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted staff to know that I was fine, and I wanted to be removed from my status... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison of the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he had considered suicide while in Kuwait and had fainted once because of the heat.
He added that not knowing what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning stated that he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items at his disposal were mattresses, blankets, flip flops, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion because sleeping or lying down during the day was contrary to the rules.
Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned at night, they woke him up so they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation in his Thursday testimony -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the appeal.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning stated that he had deduced from the order of his guard that he should release his cover that might have hidden his nakedness, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to release it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the night before, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning allegedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or flip flops to hurt himself, but that he had not done so.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he experienced during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is found guilty before a court martial, a trial that should be held early next year.
The defence has stated that Manning is considering pleading guilty to the less serious crimes and fighting for the abandonment of other charges deemed to be too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include the theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, illegal publication of information on the Internet, and transmission of national defence information.
If all charges are brought against him, he shall be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says Mexico-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, when I arrived in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two routes: one for "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), and another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I remained motionless for several seconds, not knowing which line to lead me.
I grew up in central California, where I was called the Mexican my whole life.
This is an ethnic qualifier, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish", or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian".
Then I became Mexican-American.
But, here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that saw my grandfather born, there is no need for any special qualifier or trait of union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to manage an interview in either language.
But I don't have native vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed for the "Foreigners" line.
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favourite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risking themselves in the United States.
He wants to join forces with the United States and Canada, and create a Union for Trade like the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory in writing at the tip of the gun.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and no minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans violate the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And Montezuma's kids are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer opportunities.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person was a typical person -- dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that this is the American dream we are living, and not the dream of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is evident.
We grant it to the United States.
On the other hand, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they hold us as if we were inferior and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
Had our families not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we wouldn't be stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexico Americans, because Mexicans more firmly claim their identity and Mexico Americans are upset.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels that she is part of two countries.
On the other hand, many Mexico Americans I know don't feel like they're part of one country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexico Americans to work as makeshift ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the pervasive wage inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to take care of yourself, amigos.
That's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexico Americans always blame them for the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there never be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is in vain.
While the same futile arguments persist as to who started, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
The Arab Spring has shattered everything, and whether we like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify even further.
Yet there is every reason to believe that this could help them to overcome this deadly impasse.
A war that doesn't make any losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Although the ceasefire granted on 21 November continues, this week's fighting has reinforced supporters of the force on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has led Gaza since 2007, will boast of forcing Israelis to abandon, even though Gaza has been beaten up.
Having killed some of its leaders and turned the 1.7 million people of Gaza back into one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a booming regional power, once the Muslim ally closest to Israel, has taken a stand for Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in Golf.
Hamas members jubilate and say that the growing Islamicist bows around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where Hezbollah's militia exercises its domination, through Syria, where Islamist-oriented rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas' allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders rely more easily on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel's hard line will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been put back in a box.
The so-called Iron Dome missile interception system has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have criticized Hamas for being at the origin of the latest wave of violence.
But above all, Israel flourished, notably under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although rocket fire from Gaza has killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide bombings, including through the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality under international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more belligerent party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the election on 22 January, has the beautiful part.
Why are these damn Palestinians pampered by giving them a condition?
If they were heading the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they pull their heads out.
Perhaps the hard-line supporters will win; but the Arab Spring may change the deal.
Even if Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel very much, their priority will be to tackle problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to secure a ceasefire, which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel — much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by the reasonable people on both sides, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give the outsiders an opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now put an end to the flow of weapons to Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal for a pseudo-state in the United Nations.
Obama also has every interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term of office, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back at the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packages came into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law came into force in Australia as a world first, the logos and colors were replaced by a dark olive green and horrible photos of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to deter youth from smoking by eliminating glamorous portrayal.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have revealed, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said this would boost the black market trade, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
"There will be adverse consequences from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask horrible packaging, has increased sharply two months since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in the high court of Australia.
Ha has stated that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting a renewal of stock.
For us, business is good.
The only boredom, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the segment of population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting TV advertising, sports sponsorship and the requirement for retailers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign websites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and only have a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the ultimate place to go," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some Lambda citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves whether this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has bothered to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry is focusing on the new regulations in force rather than on marketing.
Industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries have told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in 2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make warning photos on packaging mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and put the package away," said Victor El Hage when buying a package with a picture of a tumor in your mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna be arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in central Sydney, said the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on displays.
"Before I needed an hour to unload a package, now I need four hours," said Yu.
"The government had only to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's okay, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to be bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in child development praise boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to be bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, even to nurture creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome open-armed boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll come back to it.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case," says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The trouble goes back a long way," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, dating back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and discussed, in various ways, said John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After going through many publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as "an experience of wanting to do something, but without getting into a satisfactory activity."
What distinguishes boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although he or she would like to do so.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the process of attention, associated with a gloomy mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Trouble can be very much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while both can be related, bored people tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an older experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the next room, the too high sound of a TV show that had no connection, others just heard the TV show, and the third group didn't hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low noise level said that they had become more bored than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this concentration problem to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or challenging task, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "like looking at objects on a editing chain, music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when you swirl or scratch, these actions, often considered signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to giggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay unmoved," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Scale of Predisposition to Trouble" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements like, "Among the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and in particular need numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are blasé quickly.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of teens reported being bored at school and while homeworking at home, while 23 per cent reported being bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether today's boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: Is boredom good for you?
Sometimes no, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"Neardom is the way the brain found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at the N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't have learned to take care of himself or self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant bubbling generated by activities and technology is the goal we should strive for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this.
"We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it is difficult to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a university student and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and a few friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons to appear for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his use - minor offences, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But is it one?
During the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado's vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been dismissed.
The police have stopped charging adults 21 years of age and older for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative ridings have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to charge those who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana sales businesses in their neighbourhoods.
"Things are moving so fast that I don't know what the future holds for us," said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora Chief of Police, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators are also asking a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidance on how to install a permit system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most states in terms of marijuana regulation, first of all in terms of therapeutic use and now in terms of personal use.
" Colorado has a more regulated market and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr Smith admits, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves," he said.
Washington's I-502 law takes effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, during which the permit system will still not exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical issues remain unresolved: how to balance the state's mandate that guarantees appropriate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the establishment of cannabis sales shops within a 30 km radius around a school, park, playground or crèche.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up a licensed cannabis sales business, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson for the recently formed Cannabis Legalization Centre.
On 21 November, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City Attorney" (representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office) would no longer prosecute persons 21 years of age or older who own small quantities of marijuana, and that the police should cease charging persons for this type of "immediate" crime.
Chief Oates stated that the police would implement the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that they would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, the "district attorney" (Procureur de la République), Ken Buck, embodies a more stringent vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, primarily in order to pressure users to be detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are charged with other offences.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those persons who committed an offence that, at the time of the offence, was a recognized offence," said Mr. Buck.
Reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative to restrict marijuana use.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer summon adults for possession of limited quantities.
The representative of the County Public Prosecutor's Office, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss all marijuana detention cases.
"I don't feel like wasting my time continuing to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and government framework for personal marijuana use is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different American cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with representatives of the Public Prosecutor's Office, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing people accused of marijuana use and speaking as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They spent a good deal of their lives prosecuting people who used marijuana, so they find it hard to accept it as legal," he said.
As the first states to treat the restricted use of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are about to become a case law case for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and government officials are planning a new legalized sales border, they are looking forward to the federal government's directives, which still sees the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will yield.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients on therapeutic marijuana and vendors, the federal government has mainly allowed businesses selling therapeutic marijuana to operate in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police are probably not going to break down the doors to seize small drug bags, it is likely that they are opposed to licensed marijuana sales for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political advisor to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments have approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales businesses, even if this is only a one-year carry-over.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a six-month moratorium, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
"We don't want to end up in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we face a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mistreated and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not only today's students who are being attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and began to cry.
My friends were disconcerted.
The L'Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson pretended that I was gone after being forced to drink in chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I had been subjected to intimidation and constant bullying.
Not because of my rather outspoken name, not because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for a single reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behaviour: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential counsel to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why are you talking about this today, you'll tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of centre-right students suffer the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The Conservative members of the Student Hall (JCR) of Corpus Christi College stated that they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable" because of their political views.
They want a representative on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their views can be freely expressed.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right"), devoted to student politics, which portrayed "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
In particular, the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who travels in Rolls-Royce, wears a silver complete and moves with a chromed head cane.
In other universities, conservative students claim to be treated as scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper "that there is growing left-wing bias in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate was "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the Ouca, said that there had been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who were centre-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one who thought that way during my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and paralysing shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted against granting Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title because of the reduction in funding for graduate studies.
The atmosphere was loaded with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students got to know each other and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen afterwards.
I discovered that professors not only participated in sarcasm towards Tory students, but also took pleasure in it.
It was as if the policy on striker miners, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were engraved in the woods of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm of which I was a victim was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a small man with a pustulous face, was easily carried away.
"Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears were burning my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he said in a harrowing tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and then felt a slight slap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student, named James, who introduced himself as a member of Ouca.
"I know who you are," he said, nicely.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Any person suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me already, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most Tory youth claim to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I loosely tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Ms. Thatcher had said.
This scheme has failed.
A first-year student in philosophy, political and economic science who ironically had studied in Eton said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students have taken over the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Would I have only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
Have I been forced to meet people who share the same points of view only after dark?
Should I have become Labour and denied my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a Conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy advisor to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his adherence to the Marxist-Determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents' home in London, finding refuge with my more open-minded family and urban friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I told him why.
He was unbelieving.
During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But this is the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreaming bell towers.
Even my communist friends had flawless manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a session of work conducted the following week, when another history professor suggested most seriously in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Rumbling inwardly with shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and called them "old fools."
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who stuck the last nail in my oxfordian coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I never went back there.
You can call me a whiny chicken.
But no 18-year-old child should be subjected to such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Prime Ministers Tory, but also enjoys an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place of British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his couture house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the highlight of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there is an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from the modest designer of the city of Voghera, in the north of Italy, to the idol of the international jet set.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least they don't crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop music stars do," said Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of the beauties of time such as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charisma of the designer.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Square in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
One could see and feel his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", which started working with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He will never pass from fashion, because his creations are works of art," she concludes.
Parade of nobility lineage
Garavani's life is not a matter of obsessions but of shared love.
He likes the well-bred and with the greatest titles and they like it too.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre wide podium that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to march on the podium to admire a dream "public" wearing Valentino's main creations, such as Jackie Kennedy's tailor for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, Monica Vitti's costume in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
This public of models includes names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria and Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006
Many of her clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember perfectly.
These were trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-72 collection.
"It was a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to all others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimates our beauty," adds Feria's ex-duchess.
I very much like the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion girl Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of being the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward of Line.
It was a red evening dress, with a flying skirt, a draped bustier and a neckline to fall.
"It was a dream come true," said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the intemporel," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the evening dresses of the couturier with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also all the memories that she carries".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the designer thus calls his seamstresses) to make this dress in ivory silk with inlays of pearls, twelve different kinds of laces and a drag of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the haute couture of the late 20th century, "the return of the clients of the high society".
Obnominated for years by the "know-being" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani holds as many honours as any spouse of her clients.
"His refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance have always jumped in my eyes," admits d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If a princess says so...
The hardest job in the world: Kawah Ijen's human mule
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their life and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by carrying sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It has to work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas emanating from the entrails of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After collecting large sulphur rocks, which weigh a total of nearly 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 meters to the peak of the volcano that peaks at 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a tortoise pace, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euro for each kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once at the top, he made a way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and painfully carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the scale that a mining company installed a little below at 1,850 meters of altitude.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) per kilo of sulphur.
She then sells it to the petrochemical industry at 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro), since this ore is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes him 3 hours and he finishes exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is the triple of what it would gain in the fields.
"The income of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)", says the bearer who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) a day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and her eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life defying the danger on the Kawah ljen, but sulphur has already begun to charge him the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and her eyes are irritated by toxic gases released by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work for another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in an English that is more than acceptable.
Misled by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unsanitary wood massure with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because sulphur does not cease to spring at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the midst of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater by lighting himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the baskets of sulphur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work for themselves and are paid by weight.
Moreover, they also do not receive a sub of the 30,000 rupees (2,50 euros) of increase per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1,20 euros), that the guards of this natural park charge to the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protestes Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which are obviously added their usual breathing problems, arthroses, pains in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on its back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometres away by a weed-covered goat trail.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says, opening her mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of her five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult trades in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah Ijen volcano.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame this lack of children for the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and let us give life!
It may seem implausible that these words come from an advertisement for mint lozenges, but despite that, or perhaps because of that, the video spread like a gunpowder trail on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polichinelle in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people "feel their national duty."
It is intended solely for the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt that it was a theme that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things, such as throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative but they did not necessarily work.
So we said to ourselves: what more creative to solve this problem than to make it a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singapore government does not take it so lightly.
He spends US$1,300 a year on politics to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favour of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, in accordance with its national population distribution, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, it was in 1976.
Why, then, do Singaporeans not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family formation," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and to delays in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound in barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese who are accused of drawing salaries down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's party has had its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box", which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the EL Developers real estate company, claims that its "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger housing.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer instructions to proponents, who were previously put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small housing units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new regulations may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by discussing with Singaporeans working in the centre's financial district, they do not seem to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that's why people put it back," says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But for me, it is important to be able to dispose of my money and my time," another young man, about twenty years old, tells us.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as reasons for preventing them from having children.
Thus, while the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for those under 16 years of age?
How can this definition be applied in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share off-line?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, who were frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" with "password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
"I won't reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says ten-year-old Jorge when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I'm not going to share one of my photos or someone who's making a fool," he says.
The boy acknowledges that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked people, crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge assures that he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are family.
Her mother is one of them, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends quickly," he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust someone who would recommend a stranger to him.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
"It doesn't worry me because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one made any advances or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today under the name of cyber-harassment are no stranger to the young boy.
A relative of one of my friends was racketed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he says.
The victim, according to José, didn't close his account.
"He only spent it in a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to set up his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or angry.
"Even though I know it's cyber-harassment," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to look for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras reports that academician Marc Prensky, who has a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are they, children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are learning ourselves," she says.
He added that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a definite criterion on what it is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or say at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them reflect.
"Their saying not to do so is useless," she says.
Then Porras lists some examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to publish a picture of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"Outside the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary schoolteacher and education counsellor, says it is essential that parents carefully read the conditions for using social networks.
By understanding each term, they will have a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to talk to foreigners.
The Unasur Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was announced earlier and theoretically adopted by the seven representatives present.
Efe has tried several times to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of the Unasur Heads of State and Government, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be disclosed after the closure of the summit, and then said that it would be published from one moment to the next on the Peruvian government's website.
When questioned on the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to summit information has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information circulated between journalists was that given by press officers of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some unease among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were calling for more important information.
Later, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South America-Arab Summit (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although it was requested with the press, it had also not circulated the statement called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to set up safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited their access to information to the maximum extent possible.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement between Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court which divides a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and declared that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleas of both parties in the Lima trial against Santiago, which begins on Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are bringing before this international court today," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of controversies, treaties and international tribunals," added President Piñera, giving a handshake to President Humala, next to the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia had denounced this week the Pact of Bogota by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua which it considered to be gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host President, Ollanta Humala, was instructed to open the proceedings in the morning and close the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action for 31 projects had been established between South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship by developing agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve access to medicines, access to low-cost Internet throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalistic matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to see a better future for our populations", concluded President Humala.
"We decided to focus on a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a speech.
Of these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were located on the transverse axes of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a larger connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide further details.
Similarly, the outcome document referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, declared, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico to discuss calmly the maritime dispute through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua which will ask for a discussion with that country," he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," added President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City where they plan to attend the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, in the context of the summit, the Bloc Defence Ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who took part in the 6th Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), in Lima, said on state television, TV Péru, that Europeans "had been killed during the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but they were now almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by the Unasur member countries.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still some reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the President of Ecuador has shown his support for the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, but we, the South Americans, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not betray his principles, but instead respected his "profound democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish courts for demanding that he undergo an interrogation in his territory concerning an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish legislation allows this to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's mental and physical health will deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"It affects everyone's health," he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be the award of a safe-conduct to allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and points out that he had discussions in London to find a solution to the confinement of WikiLeaks' founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of proceedings with different European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted safe driving from tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as its legislation quite allows, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he did not tolerate was "the mediocrity, bad faith and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the malicious or perverse politicians but the bad journalists who pay for greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this perspective, he welcomed the fact that these are not the kind of journalists "not the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate in Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality, "this destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the President of Ecuador considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We have to solve them as a whole to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the proper resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that it was "benefiting that Latin America would seize international forums if the two countries agreed to accept a judgment however firm it may be".
Referring to the possibility of his being nominated as a candidate for the future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the primarys of February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power.
"My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this eventual victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I would retire from politics.
If we ever lose, I will.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for better regional integration in order to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when she was confirmed with the HIV test.
"It was as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to inquire about him and his strenuousness was such that he had just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), where he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was speechless."
In those days, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same", said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes for reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV/AIDS infectiologist and expert, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depend on the level of immune system assignment that patients present at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reach a rate of 500 CD4.
To put it simply, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at age 25, "as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems until age 75", explained the scientist interviewed.
In order to put this progress in context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years on average.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died as a result of AIDS has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients registered on the national data base have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
Then why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem is with access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years at least, we have never lacked drugs, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to carry out earlier diagnoses and, for that, to offer mass screening tests, to all those who request it".
The experts and members of the State Council for AIDS Prevention of Jalisco (Coedida) agree with his proposal, as do the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and, despite his young age, he was already carrying AIDS and suffering from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better if I have three times a week," they say, "I don't.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To date, his parents only know that he is suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILEnio JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of World AIDS Day.
Let them take the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and the better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programmes and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, it is very good, but it results, that still today, some do not have access to condoms", he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, says the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold at counters, but be found in public toilet dispensers and in places frequented by young people.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor was it a question of paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had replied when asked whether there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, the best is to provide condoms to people already sexually active," he stressed.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 of AIDS and 1.317 of HIV).
The State is the fourth largest state in the country in terms of the number of new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th largest in terms of the number of people living with HIV.
92% of the infections occur by sex, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV, since for each registered case, there are 4 or 5 people who ignore it.
A judgment ratified on appeal by a US court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt through commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario sets a bad precedent for all national companies with ramifications in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
It therefore seems that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the starred banner, at the expense of international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment handed down on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the North District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenceless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's leading glass manufacturer to refer the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the trial judge notes that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, states that the main proceeding is formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
Indeed, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been created for that purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the inter-company vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by Vitro's subsidiaries towards the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
Here there are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since there remained the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the courts of the United States, i.e. the "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained a majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A data omitted by the appellate court.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has faced since 2008 without stopping at the serious economic crisis facing the United States, passing on costs to the country.
For the time being, the González Sada family society will appeal to the same appeal court for the vote to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance remedy will demand non-prosperity and requires review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") in which Vitro's procedure under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act was detailed, pointing out that it freed him from the agreements signed by the two countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he pointed out that the country had adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e., the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensured fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they sit on Vitro and they sit on the country.
General review
The complaints of the Mexican Aviation Company's trade unions against the company's former boss, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were ignored for several months, the latter was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association of Aviators Pilots has already encountered problems.
The body, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just submitted a criminal application against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw F/589 trust from bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Administration of Hotels.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're besieging the Dragon Mart.
A group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society, gathered in an amphitheatre at the University of the Caribbean at the weekend, and approved the creation of a broad opposition front at the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the South-East zone in order to oppose the monumental project, which is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to the industry.
ACTA's dead.
The government highlighted a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances Mexico's Ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under his English acronym of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already in ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was well that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
The globetrotter of basketball "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, has travelled all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as great as that of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain haemorrhage condemned him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of the lower leagues, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or as president of the basketball federation.
"I have worn several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his unusual itinerary, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loved most were those who reminded him of his career as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
"It was my best years, the ones I took the most advantage of because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
It's been a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a strong player for you, he's two meters tall.
Do you want it?"
That's how to start Mincy, one of Puerto Rico's best players.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win one championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He was delighted with the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only remotely since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his duties and Mincy's on the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived in fourth place and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn't had us play the last game again," said Reyes.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She was one of the best, as was the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was that of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and we beat the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (January) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world 90 due to a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the improglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all the predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it is Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Piculín did.
And that does not take into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that by the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have wanted to put in place, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, Ponce boys play only in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island during national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when this is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide by the leading role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied an unscrupulous, formidable and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of complications of cancer, according to a statement from the family sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his dear hometown of Dallas, playing the ironic role he loved most again," said the family.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who interpreted his wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said his press officer, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he was living his whole life," Gray said in a statement.
The doctors had diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he had admitted to having drunk a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was detected with a malignant tumour in the liver and had been transplanted.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television in the role of an ordinary type in the series "Jinny of my dreams" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he performed the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also played in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in the cinema, we find roles well received by the critics in "Le groupe", "Harry et Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and their relatives was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated speculation all over the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the response was revealed in an episode in November 1980, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave town, but others also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) interned.
"I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "Ci-gis the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, remembered this Friday of Hagman as a man " immense, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us, who have had the chance to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already finished for the second season and a sixth is in progress, informed the channel.
For the time being, neither Warner nor TNT have communicated on how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who has known fame with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps in New York theatres in the early 1950s and served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': Les mémoires merciles de J.R)
"I wrote nothing in this book that could hurt or affect someone in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I trust them again, I come with them when they come for surgery and after," he says in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it's gonna be okay."
He has also been an anti-tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course on the "End of the World" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a lecture on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing there an irresistible hook: the end of the "great count" of the Maya calendar, on December 21, to which many people refer as proof of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what was waiting for him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax abyss that some dubbed "the Armageddon of debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end times thought that the apocalypse would trigger.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," said Professor Charmé this week to his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey.
If we look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, it was a very good time.
And we must remember that what is evil is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he's not the only teacher to teach about "the end of the world" this semester, which will be, in theory, the last in history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real life examples.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply entitled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world does not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," said Restall.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-level students, made up of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the start of the semester, from people who asked if there was room.
The students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people can do to comfort themselves," says 23-year-old religious and sociology student Bridgid Robinson from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of Revelation, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Sickness, claims to have watched all apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone one professor, told us that they believed in the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it," says Julie zegle, a 21-year-old Temple student from West Chester.
The Mayas have never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I concede that there is an anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back centuries, that makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to a rise in these speculations.
"In other places around the globe, people don't think about that," he says.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that we were teaching here about "the end of the world".
"The Philippines is not taking part in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years, we have talked about the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or thinking about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and professors take the date lightly.
Many told us they were thinking of going to "end of the world" parties.
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh at them together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
