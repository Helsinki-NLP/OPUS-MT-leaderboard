Inflation in Europe has derailed on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the price increase in the 13 euro area countries was higher than forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, said the European Community statistical office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts only indicated 3 per cent, said Bloomberg.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the key interest rate by saying that lower interest rates, with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment rates, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two per cent.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "we must dissuade" inflation in order to no longer have to intervene on this subject at a later date.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record in the last 12 years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area took off because of the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Grain futures market ratings have increased by 88 per cent and soybean prices have also reached their highest since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, the world price of oil rose by 52 per cent and last month a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, over the next 3-4 months, the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce the key interest rate twice in 2008.
Gallup points to government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) has increased significantly at the beginning of December. So since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Survey Institute) has never seen such low socialist support, i.e. 13 percent.
For the faithful voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, a support of more than two thirds (71 percent) against the support of a fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Hungarian Democratic Forum) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the parliamentary threshold: their support is two per cent throughout the population.
Of the loyal voters some went to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate compared to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly severe has never been higher, it amounts to 41 per cent and, according to 46 per cent, the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of last spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
Next year, the majority of the population anticipates an increase and only one-tenth anticipates an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 per cent of those surveyed, a majority never seen in previous Gallup polls, felt that the Prime Minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 per cent do not trust the Prime Minister at all and 27 per cent trust the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of change in the political situation is the proportion of society that believes that discontent with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While after the riots of last October, 35 percent of respondents wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, at present this rate is only 20 percent. The relative majority (33 percent) believes that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
When asked about the intention to vote, 60 per cent of respondents said they would certainly vote and the additional 20 per cent said they would probably vote.
For comparison, for a "legislative election next Sunday", only 55 per cent of those polled would certainly participate and 15 per cent would probably participate. According to current intentions, the result of the referendum would be no doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to higher education fees, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees, and 84 per cent would say no to hospital fees.
When we look only at the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent respectively would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital living expenses.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent last year, the difference being that this year the VAT rate did not increase.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas Basket also increased by 16 per cent on average, a value increase of well over a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, "which had already flown away" in the major food stores last December, have not risen sharply compared to the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The Daily Basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but prices for turkey fillet, nuts and poppy rose sharply.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but at Auchan, only 139 forints of bread were found.
Competition has not lowered the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it only cost 257 forints the bottle included.
Nevertheless, this year, in terms of Daily Basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its Daily Basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing last year's most expensive basket with this year's cheapest basket, we see a difference of 12 percent, while the difference between last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive basket is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices rose by an average of 1,206 forints, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noticed in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has made trade perplexed, hypermarkets could not visibly determine what margin to apply to products as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he risks losing a big profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Because of the change in the rate of VAT, the increase in the prices of the Daily Basket evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than the value of the 2006 basket, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the value of the most expensive basket was 1,630 forints higher than last year and prices at the least increased by 1,284 forints as well.
By bringing the two Christmas seasons closer together, we have seen a catastrophic price increase, and in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer items have increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: for some essential supplies, the statistical institute has seen a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, of flour and egg.)
According to the Daily Basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the evidence, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have succeeded in gaining acceptance of the sharp price increase also by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-storage food per pallet.
Wednesday morning important tails formed at the crates of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less significant in the provinces, many multinationals complain to the survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, caused mainly by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been registered in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overworking of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the Chief Medical Officer of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals are also saving on disinfectants
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was detected on a man hospitalized following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured person in a serious car accident came out of the hospital but shortly after he had to return because of an MRSA infection and, since then, the doctors were unable to perform a major operation because of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-drug-resistant pathogen were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, Chief Medical Officer of the National Epidemiology Centre.
To know that it is the number of infections caused by a multi-drug resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e., methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as anginas, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily cured.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a bacteria that is well resistant to antibiotics that will proliferate rapidly in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicemia, on elderly patients, small weights or with a weakened organism.
According to the medical director of János hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
Above all, we must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only where we do not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the health care staff wear rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they carry MRSA, however infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample sampling is not in mode
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not favourable to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-drug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and seniors' homes, hospitals should monitor in-patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these examinations.
Most cases occur only if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the Chief Medical Officer of the Epidemiological Centre.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian directives for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even more rare in ambulatory and basic care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks. However, there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA proliferate by inhalation of droplets and contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, rooms are often full, beds are often too close to each other, while in terms of epidemics, patients should be at least 1.5 metres away from each other.
Unfortunately, we also see that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, are saving on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures, the number of infections is lower in a demonstrable way or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is an exorbitant expense for social security funds, which is why this infection is being combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of ASM.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections are showing a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) identifies as one of its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-drug-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The commissioner, who was responsible for a fatal accident, was not intoxicated.
The official finding concerning the fatal accident caused by the commissioner of the 22nd district was drawn up.
It may be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has resigned from his post since then, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have led to a state of intoxication or stunned, communicated Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation, which has already found that the former Commissioner did not drink alcohol before driving.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd district police station crushed a 55-year-old man who was facing him when he shot, with his personal car, in Kossuth Lajos Street in the 22nd district. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian crossing.
(In fact, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not a mitigating circumstance, according to the Highway Code, a car that starts a turn must let pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being taken to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and requested his retirement because, according to police communication, this accident greatly upset him.
The investigation into this case is carried out by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Budapest.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
Additional EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Hungary's Minister of Finance János Veres and Vice-President Marta Gajecka of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three EUR 400 million agreements in Budapest on a credit line to support education, transport and environment infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, of which a credit contract worth EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties.This time, the contract signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The agreement on the appropriation of EUR 150 million also covers the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, while the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a €50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope in the first place as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the metro line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would discuss the possible modification of the original contract once Hungary has finalized the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans at the EURIBOR-linked interest rate, with a grace period of 8 years and no commitment commission.
Bulgaria, the paradise of the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this Balkan country little cited in the past.
What, or who is bought in this EU market that is always the cheapest but will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses by the cheap sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pambrovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but more and more of them are looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also more and more to buy in the very cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital city, also offers attractive opportunities, with commercial and office space promising the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter seasons, also in the other two seasons of the year.
The more vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are at the same time seeking to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. Along the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who intend to settle in buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old dilapidated houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, proximity to a large city, shops and, in general, that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of second homes (since last December Bulgaria has been listed as one of the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving medium- or long-term added value.
The price of capital buildings is constantly rising as a result of increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, over the last 5 years, they have increased by 21 per cent each year.
The increase in real estate prices mainly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, the meetings of professionals end Tuesday, yet Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Road Map, which is supposed to define the efforts to be made after the Kyoto Protocol's emission reduction period until 2012.
At the moment, there are intense discussions on this issue between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, it did not wish to discuss exact figures, although it was prepared to sign an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries commit themselves, excluding emission reductions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement has also been signed on aid to developing countries.
The Kyoto Protocol aid fund will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, probably under the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF), reported Piac es Profit (Market and Profit).
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Environment and Water Minister Gábor Fodor confirms the EU's ambition to retain its role as a flagship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the "Post-2012 Agreement", and was prepared to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30 per cent if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also prepared to make commitments appropriate to their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997 the Kyoto Protocol countries had achieved a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members at that time made the commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the period 1985-87, and our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The challenge is great in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the Kyoto Protocol values would not be immediately followed by a new international system for reducing emissions, the need for which was stressed in the new report of IPCC, an international scientific body, which won the UN Nobel Peace Prize for dealing with climate change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the Earth's average temperature by more than 2 degrees celcius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
The British Army units communicate on the video-sharing site recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with the aim of becoming popular.
First of all, it was the British Air Force (RAF) that was passionate about YouTube: the special units operating in Afghanistan are loading video footage of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, announced the BBC.
These recordings, taken with miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are checked at the headquarters of the air force operations in Kandahar and then transferred to Londres where the compatriots charge them on the Internet.
The political message is inescapable
Air Force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences online through this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered under the name "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and released videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were posted on the Internet to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to publicize to the general public the real objectives of the army's presence abroad.
Propaganda published in this way costs almost nothing compared to the usual advertising of recruitment on television, communicated to the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant. On the other hand, it inevitably carries a political message as it justifies in a special form the soundness of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game.
The army is annoyed because, apart from the videos composed and censored carefully, amateur videos have passed on to the sharing site which also present, for example, the deaths of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos had already been posted on the Internet showing the areas of operation in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only recently been busy loading these videos.
Americans do the recruitment a little differently by using the free downloadable America's Army Shooting Game. In this game the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas raffle and donuts in ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a meeting at the end of the year with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by taking donuts and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a party with live music, another will enchant officials with a raffle and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, as well as the power.
The public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be hosted by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the employees of the Ministry who will be invited to attend.
At Christmas, Orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The ministry has a budget of 25 million forints to create the year-end atmosphere.
In comparison with other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will be celebrating.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the six hundred employees in bulk, three hundred and fifty are expected.
At this party, the atmosphere of Christmas will be strict, there will be actors and also a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was organised Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) with concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost one million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party which is organised with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a company managing tenders.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté was rented for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we were unable to reach the person in charge.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, organized a ball on the occasion of Saint Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
That ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's words of welcome and the dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: Evening dress was not mandatory at all at this ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Local Government are preparing a sober holiday.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, within its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not invite his collaborators officially to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected who will be invited to have coffee and to eat doughnuts, the press service said, the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his collaborators to have a drink in the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large hall, at which 436 employees are expected.
He plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees have been celebrating Christmas in the same way every year.
No party atmosphere planned, the official character is reinforced not only by the minister's presentation but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organise a reception on 20 January to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at the castle of Vajdahunyad, located in the town wood, and according to the communication of the ministry, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this is going to be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, begin with a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate at all for Christmas, have communicated to [origo] the respective press services.
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than 400 people were invited to the festival at the Musée de l'art décoratif.
The forces of the mega strike gather
On Friday, the unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will set up their strike commission, which will be responsible for coordinating the indefinite strike of Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the law on health funds, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause important traffic jams because rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the league unions will make known the details of their Monday strike, organised with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The strike commission of LIGA - MOSZ will also be constituted, it will serve as coordinator of the actions of Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, from Monday, the organisations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the law on health funds, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the law on health funds, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide what to do next.
According to Monday's agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Fund Act will take place only late in the evening or even at night.
As a result of the strike scheduled for Monday, major traffic jams are planned: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volán companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for the strike, the list of them is constantly updated on the website of the League.
Some organizations report an indefinite strike, while others report a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) failed to reach an agreement on the minimum services, but as Christmas parties approached, more and more people took the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., Budapest airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike for four hours, the Teachers Union and the Democratic Union of Teachers have called to strike for two hours and from 2 a.m. to 8 a.m. respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country alternately, the Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will strike two hours warning.
The most important of the four demands, made by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and to submit a new concept to social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating retirement to be introduced from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third demand is for a guarantee of retirement before the legal age, which would allow the system to take on the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), attached to the Syndicates de la Ligue, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased country risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, set up last August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary), increases, in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", the society points out that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term aggressive ethnic confrontations may occur as a result of the worsening ethnic tension already existing between the Gypsy and non-gypsy population of Hungary".
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy, which is likely to cause this situation, is the main reason.
As they say, this is due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings which based a political strategy on the dispute between the Gypsies and Hungarians".
The problem is compounded, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely to occur, they say.
However, according to the research institute, due to the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary abroad, particularly with regard to the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following a greater publicity given to the reorganization of the radical and extreme right Hungarian groups since autumn 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 calling themselves the "national self-defence association".
“The common feature of these rallies is that they define themselves as a civil organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their members for defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, defence of order), armed if necessary, moreover, by referring to the incapacity of the police, the army, in other words the state”, they added.
They pointed out that everything was going according to the method which, based on the resentment of the political society and of the parties, sought to disguise different political ambitions in a civil aspect.
The emphasis on the civil character and the status of association therefore serves only to avoid the legal traps of registering such associations in court, but they also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultra-nationalist political actors of some neighbouring countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard's constitution.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous disturbances of Roma that broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) led to the formation of the Bulgarian Guard.
In taking advantage of these events, the UNB decided to establish a guard by saying that the organization's objective is “national self-defence”.
According to them, over the past 17 years, the Gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had generated considerable debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement of some Bulgarian Roma organisations regarding the establishment of their own guard as a means of resistance points to the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not preclude the Hungarian Roma from reacting to the threat in the same way by organising their own self-defence, according to the warning of risk of Political Capital.
At the request of the telegraph agency, Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform public opinion, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common practice to reorganise working days, the number of which will decrease next year.
Parties are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes between national and state holidays and rest days.
Days of rest are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the New Year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that New Year's Evers can rest quietly.
Moreover, in one year we have a total of eleven festivals marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, in commemoration of the revolution of 1848, as is October 23, which is also the memorial day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1 is Labour Day, and on November 1 and 2, we remember our dead family and friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state holidays, national or religious rarely falling on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases where there is only one working day before or after the feast marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price for extended weekends by working or going to school the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has made special regulations on the replacement days of the days preceding or following the holidays.
The Act extends to all employers and their employees, to civil servants and to persons working in the public service.
However, it does not apply to service companies, with institutions rotating continuously and in service, because of their vocation, and also for days of rest.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end-of-year holidays: from December 24th, life almost stops all over the country because according to experiences the majority of people do more overtime or take vacations that they have saved for these purposes so that they can spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized for the first time around the Labour Day to allow employees to stay at home four days in a row.
Saturday 25 April will be a day of work to have a day of rest on Friday 2 May.
Another change is scheduled for October 23rd: Saturday, October 18th will be a replacement working day on Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year promises to be marked by the holidays because from 24 December, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can bother colleagues terribly
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost more: they are things that "enhance" the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether we get used to these problems or rise to the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing department," a colleague told you.
That you missed a date?
At best he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with an apology.
Before you have painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
You're borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your co-worker's desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking or they're right to be mad at you for stealing their good.
Don't bring envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there are no more envelopes and that you need them right now.
Are you chatting about the privacy of colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop spreading gossip.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone your information (suppositions) about your colleagues' privacy!
If a colleague shares his or her intimate secrets with you, don't abuse his or her trust!
Bury the shared information in you and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you saying you're sick without just cause?
When you call the office and you declare yourself sick on the pretext of a tearing headache because you feel bad or feel you need to rest that day, think of the fact that your work, your urgent business, your missions at term must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to work or something that might make you stay home, don't forget to tell your boss and your colleagues to avoid them being surprised at your absence the next day.
Frederic, sneezing, phone
You're immersing yourself in your work, but your co-workers' snitch is pulling you out of it brutally?
Have you become, without wanting, a witness to a telephone conversation that you would have done better not to listen?
Don't disturb your colleagues with humming, singing, talking aloud (which you lead above their heads), kicking, big words or discontent expressed aloud.
They can disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
You blame the others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the deadline, you forget to send a mail or an important message, do not accuse anyone for this oversight!
Don't put it on the account of the possible chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you have made a mistake and if it has caused inconvenience to others, make up for it!
Ask how you can fix your fault, fix negligence!
Do you feel too home at the office?
Putting a jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Do not put on comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Don't be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your job requires it by putting on pretty and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're no longer interesting.
We're moving slowly in the usual morning stopper.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with electronic effects associated with it.
I'm raising the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones of earlier, then a female choir joins it like a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts Zagar's Wings of Love.
Hungarian music life has not spoiled us for a long time with good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the plug becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born of the Hungarian digital underground are gradually beginning to change the overall picture and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in the Yunderboi band before he started his own way, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe."
His project (Zagar) and his music, an ally of jazz, electronic dance and pop music, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the soundtracks filmed (e.g.
The Ferenc Török season).
The training initially played in small clubs began to be known to a wider audience when the wan2 magazine quoted their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important records on the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yunderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his whole became unquestionably "trendy" but no one asked them if they would wear this label.
The band reacted properly, released a new and better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, recently released, can open new avenues for them, although the title wants to represent continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line of the former group of Pécs de Balázs Zságer.
We are there with the reference to flight but next to the aerial music now appears, following the spirit and trend of the time, the guitar stronger, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the premiere of the album at the Millennial Park.
On the album, we find a real tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
So it's okay (?).
Hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: did your music remain a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; non mainstream or underground, non alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The so-called alternative music, underground can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere too.
The reception attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is either more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
The, people go to concerts and not only the young people of about ten or twenty years old but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am obviously glad to see that more and more people come to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us music is not meant to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important at concerts or the mutual influence already works but it is perceived only in the elusive changes of the moment.
Now, I've noticed that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you won't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and has a career in the west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
Instead, we are team players who trust each other's musical presence and let them deploy.
At first, it was of course inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because we are many to leave his group and to take another path.
hvg.hu: On the list of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love ranks first.
Many people heard Zagar's name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style did you consciously open to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't plan on making a tube so we could sell the record.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the final album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
The six-member choir was composed, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth, which was later called Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want that song like that or did the girls change it a little bit?
Zs.B.: This song already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought that something was missing from this song.
The sequence of chords attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the same night the melody that the girls learned later.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me back then, but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert also it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of a short solo by Judy Jay), they don't have a role alone, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than music, so music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were back on the stage, too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we have to forget our ego a little bit, forget who comes from where, who goes or, you just have to let those wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to also feel that euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: Actually, none of the music creation process, we had more difficult songs during the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything got set up like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I have already "released" this record.
At the moment, they are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader treacherous to risk billions because of its inferiority complex
A covert fraudster.
Thus designates its former employee the French giant the Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros because of him.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be considered incapable.
Unlike all large bank houses, he recognized in time the crisis of the American mortgage market.
"He's fragile," his superiors have suggested, reporting him to the police.
However, if we stick to Kerviel's testimony reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions produced a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year.
Crisis Exceeds the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to win half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that so-called "sub-prime" mortgages, granted to low-income clients or to those who had experienced repayment difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he bet.
As a result, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"As soon as I won my first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," says Kerviel, adding that he did not, of course, keep anything for himself."
Throughout the interrogation, he confesses to having distorted the reports so as not to be detected.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who risks nothing has nothing
Was he afraid to be discovered?
More like no.
"I felt that the mere fact of getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where does his willingness to risk so much come from?
He only gradually arrived at his post.
He had started working at Societe Generale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant trader and in 2005 he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90 thousand.
Yet he knew that he would never win as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was far less considered than the others.
With regard to my academic background and my professional and personal background," Kerviel told investigators.
Soon after he took office, however, he won his first great success.
Thanks to the Allianz shares, he won half a billion euros by relying on the drop in this title during the attacks in Londres.
And the mechanism was triggered - it wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you in peace.
"There was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors knew everything, or rather, they suspected it.
"As long as I won, they were pretending to close their eyes."
Now, that's when the start of the year comes.
He loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to conceal the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who doesn't take a vacation is a trader who doesn't want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech Government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, who could, in the coming years, contribute 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech kroner) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly NOK 125 billion from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about SEK 100 billion under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will be responsible for an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund which will manage a sum of SEK 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, must be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new and more efficient management methods.
Up to now, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds among the new members.
The Court confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for $100 million in fraud (nearly NOK 1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released and living under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will or will not be re-incarcerated is not clear at the moment, according to the PA agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison officers, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or they will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemán regularly moved money from the government to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
They were fictitious companies and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and his closest supporters.
Part of this money went into the funds that Alemán had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted.
That's the way it is.
The State budget was adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without opposition support.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford its refusal.
Unlike the agitated debate before the vote on the declaration of confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies has passed this law without any problem, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
That's some kind of paradox.
Whether you like it or not, each chapter and article is the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, although hidden behind the power competition between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why more attention is given to it in the media.
The arguments of politicians are much more interesting to opinion than the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments suffered three ills which the current budget is not capable of settling at once:
The first is the large share of the money spent on warrants imposed by the law, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social security contributions, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that is the biggest hazard.
The latter is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued stunned bonds, in disproportionate debt to their municipalities, in order to obtain new sources of investment, apart from money from taxes, tax and bank credits.
In previous years, they were able to repay these debts through the mass sale of shares of distribution systems, particularly those of energy, obtained by the State through privatizations.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If only official and verifiable facts are used, it can be seen that:
Our economy has already been going through a period of growth for several years, just like the rest of the world, and ČSSD is selling it out.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were becoming more and more State-owned.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls mainly on previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least threatened by poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes which have, in recent years, unfortunately been unnecessarily swollen.
Although some of the absurd populist spending approved last year before the elections has been eliminated, if a gap in the age limit for retirement and a reform of the pension system are not to take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and anyone in power will only administer it.
By barely exaggerating, it can be said that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes ordinary costs to be pushed back by mandate costs.
The deficit of $70 billion projected for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not dissipated all the money they could.
If we really do not want to see politics in power becoming mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it can collect in tax and tax rights, the calm needed to prepare new reform laws.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to settle the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion will be placed in money markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will auction $40 billion and, in addition, provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual states have decided to take such concerted action, aimed at preventing or even reducing the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," writes Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group consulting company.
"The concerted action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 per cent to about 50 per cent," Baumohl adds in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, they must really understand what can still follow," says ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he adds.
Central banks fear that, if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect economic growth around the world.
The central banks made this choice after the interbank rate of Londres, called LIBOR, which was used to borrow on the interbank market, could not be lowered.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the US, Canadian and English central banks had repeatedly declined their interest rates in the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates," said Reuters agency Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks' approach will help to prevent the crisis, as it does not address the main problem of the fall in the real estate market in the USA.
President Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is expected to be most damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke on the issue of global warming.
Criticism this time over the UN international conference on climate change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the environmentalists' debates were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric accompanying it and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is just a rocket of words, ersatz solutions to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed, during the presentation of his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often meet only the caricature of my opinions".
From now on, interested persons can read its positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless has, in his opinion, enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following theses: the climate is constantly evolving, the changes in it are therefore normal, there is not a shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too large nor too serious, they therefore represent no danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence climate change are useless, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
All the more so since he has experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against fundamentalist environmentalism which does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring".
In Vienna Klaus had already spoken on this subject two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driving licence in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their old driver's licence whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities are able to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid permit will travel along the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving licences, especially those who no longer wish to drive.
As municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, authorities in the capital are flooded with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has increased this week.
The Town Hall satisfies about 2000 customers a day.
There's a tail of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140 000 drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to apply for the grant within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who fail to complete the mandatory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and take the road without a valid licence will be liable to a fine as of January.
The guilty party will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence through an amicable approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to SEK 2500.
According to old reports, even a person who was not going to move was liable to a fine.
In doing so, she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1,000 kroons.
However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's licence is, in his opinion, a document that people can decide whether or not they want to have it.
It is not like with the ID card that must be valid without exception.
Persons who no longer wish to drive should hand over their driver's licence.
Simply bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The court reduced the sentences of the detectives pacted with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Ko+a+k, former police officers accused of collusion with the David Berdych gang, will respectively serve 13 and 10 years in prison.
The Prague High Court thus finally sentenced them by reducing their sentences by 1 and 2 years respectively.
Originally, the Department's detectives for the fight against organized crime were at risk of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgment, only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is currently awaiting the first instance verdict.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials in excess of 16 years in prison.
He cannot receive more.
In January, the Departmental Court found guilty of involvement in 19 people, and today the Superior Court dealt with the appeal interjections of 16 of them.
Since the beginning of the investigation, most of the accused had questioned the prosecution's claim that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police officers, following an agreement with Berdych and others, passed on information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members to avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang gave 30 percent of the larceny back to Opava and Ko
The prosecution refers to the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robbery, the victims of which, in most cases, have suffered serious harm to their health, but also the abuse of the power of a public official and the prohibited armament.
During the house searches, the police discovered pistols illegally held, shells with a steel core, a viewfinder for direct laser fire or a machine gun.
According to the accusations, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly twenty men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other robberys raised Berdych and a whole series of other persons.
Other men from the Berdych neighbourhood are still explaining themselves before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived to the court.
The main hearing has avoided, for the moment, Tom+Půta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of substitution for children: 12 million
The lawyer of the affected families Igor Veleba wants to obtain compensation of 12 million crowns plus costs from the hospital in Třeb.
Three million for each mother, two million for fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of the Ondřej Dostál hospital absolutely disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a claim, which is very high," Dostál said at the end of the hearing.
"In order to be able to form an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the expert report which the opposing party has commissioned to write.
We'll check if it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," said Dostál.
According to him, the amount should be set at between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloiov's family asked for a million crowns for each month that she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation has been better borne by men, although they have been faced with remorse for not having been able to prevent the substitution of newborns.
Women, however, remain less serene in the face of the current trauma and in the face of what is happening precisely at the moment, has summarised the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the hospital in Třeb+ on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloíov.
At the end of October, the Governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil gave to each of the families 100,000 crowns for the reimbursement of the expenses caused by the error of the hospital in Třeb
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally bound by civil liability insurance.
In the event of default, they must draw from the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may request assistance from the manager.
So far the courts have recognized relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the trade mark Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Regional Court of Ostrava, he was the one who had used the title King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around the actor's former collaborator, Tom+ Harabiš.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr.Harabiš and his team are paralysing the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Valašsko's Kingdom evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comic.
Harabiš agreed.
"There is a job behind us of almost ten years.
Looking for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project has been successful and that they could benefit from it.
It is they who want to parasitize our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who first used the title valašský král (Roi de Valašsko) in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, it had no connection with the plan to set up a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of issuing passports from Valašské Království.
From a humorous action originally produced a business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and signature be mentioned in the passport and even offered the holders sales on the price of visiting his farm and his theatre shows.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the naked idea, published by Polívka in the show manéž, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské království project," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and his team, which devoted itself to the project intensely.
Collaboration between the enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating with the deposition "of King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, which the court today rejected.
What could make the case clear is the planned tournament for the throne and half the princess.
He should get a new king out of it.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to go fast.
It would be something like the king's parade in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr Polívka can of course register," added Harabiš.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: elimination of prejudices
Actually, I've never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the gear change, of the driving and also of the manufacturing could, in many respects, be described as inferior to the average.
At the moment, however, there is on the market his successor the Peugeot 207, which is much better.
All the more so as the combi named SW goes a step further, I have to think better.
When I was testing the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, for example, I complained about the head space on the back seats.
While there ended the complaints because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will be, in this respect, at ease.
Let's see if we can make it quick.
I'm going to talk about the interior very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only remark about the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a little more inventive design, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when one could complain about too short seats or backrests is over.
Lateral guidance also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in the dimensions of the bodywork is also noticeable here.
The combi also sees disappearing the lack of space above the head already mentioned.
A safe in the safe
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate it as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear swivel ice) and a rather easy stowage.
Blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold quite heavy objects.
But let's stop by the volume.
The latter, according to the tables, makes 428 l in the basic configuration, which is in relation to the competition a rather average figure.
Apart from the Škoda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in Czech Republic.
Comparing the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav's product, the Peugeot remains very much behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on holiday abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to highlight the advantages, I would mention the underside remaining after the backrests of the rear seats were overturned perfectly straight, or a very low step.
120 horsepower distributed over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what a 1.6 should look like that makes a family hatchback work.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda, which often gives the impression of having a tailpipe blocked by a mop, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
♪ Let's go through the tariffs ♪
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, one must be aware that one has tested a car quite well equipped, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4-litre engine of 329 900 Kč is still passable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410,900 Kč, which is enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 Kč.
In addition to airbags, we have equipped automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automatic control of the rear windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs 531,900 Kč.
This is a lot, but try to add the extra equipment to the Fabia price and you will get a very similar figure.
So all we have to do is choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils into British schools is not working well
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, raising concerns among the rest of the population about the development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of Northern Kent, where conflicts between remaining and immigrant Slovaks are beginning to intensify, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Arguments, chicane, and fights between students have been transformed into relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who hit a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends herself by claiming that the boy insulted him with racist remarks.
The police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we came home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks," described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went so far as to describe conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between natives and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your leave can happen if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus described it as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the repository and transhipment site of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who built it, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients, there were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50' of the last century, were circulating on the broad boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
The stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your own autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, we will mix you the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since the jigouli and fiats once imported have long ago, in a climate so salty and damp, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is appreciably decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
Over the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by fans of small trains.
The cane had returned from the extended plantations in the sugar mills on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades, and this is how we can see small locomotives in motion, the contemporary of which are not only in museums elsewhere.
Where can we direct our steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the best known places.
So there's no need to write a lot about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Vi+ales valley to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation grows on limestone soil.
Mogots, calcareous balloons and rocks ascend in candlelight from the bottom of the valley, and, fertile soil having caught in their entrails, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetal carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco of the highest quality is probably cultivated.
You can meet the final shape of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
Perhaps someone will find it equally interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was shot.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It is the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought him glory and wealth.
The richness was embodied in the beauty and character of this small town's window-city.
Koloniální španělská architektura,výrazně ovlivněná pozděj
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is such a remote place that still in the 1950s' of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay aside.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everyone just had a roof over their heads.
If we have more time than an afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth visiting interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón beach or the Sugar Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música which comes to life after sunset and where the music does not fade until the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village located in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This view is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads leading from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and pass through a landscape almost without any marks of human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed the Eastern Sewage of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in fact, it was born about a hundred years after Columbus' journey) and from the hill where the old castle-fort and the current hotel El Castillo is held, we see several mountain table, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Sows and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this one could fill a quantity of pages.
Only, as they say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, say Americans
According to the United States, the lack of soldiers and necessary equipment has an impact on the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not proceeding as it should, agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing opposition from the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are now also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States, through Defence Minister Robert Gates, called NATO troops for greater activity this week, Britain's priority is strengthening the Afghan government's authority and stepping up development aid.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety per cent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to data from the US army, the most intense of the last five years.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 per cent from last year, to 60 per cent in Helmand Province, in the south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, almost a quarter of them in the southern part.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are requesting additional helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
"I'm not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters Agency at the end of the three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Which is passive
In recent months there have also been conflicts between the countries involved in the issue if all allies are actually doing everything possible in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the fighting demands they face are not as stringent as those in the south and east parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun called the German soldiers lazy this week.
"The Afghan lazy discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went counter-attack by publishing a photo of a British troupe during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The state debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
Each Czech State is responsible for a State debt in excess of NOK 84 000.
At the end of September, the total debt increased to NOK 842.7 billion.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroons this year.
As a result of better-than-expected changes in the government's budget savings, the Department has reduced the planned amount to NOK 152.8 billion.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to NOK 842.7 billion.
During the nine months of this year it has therefore increased by 40.2 billion kroons.
From June onwards, however, it decreased by 13.4 billion kroons.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on State debt dating from early October.
Each Czech is responsible for a debt in excess of NOK 84 000.
Over the last year, the State has been in debt of more than NOK 111 billion.
"For the time being, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, we could cross the border by a trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for the iHned.cz server.
The forecast of Next Finance Analyst Vladimír Pikor is similar: "We could exceed the trillion in 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene was changing, that policies were prepared to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I am not waiting for this change," he said.
Debts grow
The debt of the State consists of the debts of the central government and is generated mainly by the accumulation of deficits in the State budget.
Government debt is financed by treasury bills, annuity securities, direct borrowings or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The State's domestic debt has increased this year from NOK 38.5 billion to NOK 719.4 billion.
The State's external debt has increased this year from DKr 1.7 billion to DKr 123.3 billion.
The debt of the State called negotiable reached at the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average debt liability of the State amounted to 6.5 years.
"Total debt grew inter-annually from the first to the third half of the year by 13 per cent, which, given the current healthy economy, is far too high.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by annuity securities, where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debt will grow, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be something to negotiate when the pension reform comes," Pikora commented.
Better than we expected.
As a result of the government's planned financing and debt management strategy for 2007, the government had planned to borrow NOK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of September, however, thanks to better than expected changes in the savings in the state budget, the Ministry reduced the planned sum to SEK 152.8 billion.
The sum is mainly constituted by the deficit of the State budget, which is clearly going to reach SEK 76 billion this year, instead of the SEK 91.3 billion originally planned.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources envisaged for the Czech consolidation agency, namely 13.3 billion kroons, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state pension securities for 43 billion kroons and the repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to 1.8 billion kroons.
She was appearing today before a court in Khartoum for having named a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and deportation, said her lawyer.
The British woman was accused of letting students between the ages of 6 and 7 give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any representation of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was punished with whiplash.
The 54-year-old British teacher at the United High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with violating Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints by parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story goes back to September, when this teacher asks her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
"Eight names come out of the mouths of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says the director of the Robert Boulos school.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then produced a book for the class with the bear's photo followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself had no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of representing the prophet as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said it was only an "innocent mistake".
Opinion shared by many of the teacher's students who describe her as "very caring towards her students" and "who never speaks of religion in the classroom".
Recall that the first name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Great Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can we give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, they did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
On Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians completed a sixth and final session of discussions without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the Statute," said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake”, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to honour their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not anticipate violence in the immediate future, but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist."
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika mediators, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Kharchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was given a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, are insisting on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Kharchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina expresses its readiness to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," announced the president of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future premier of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “belongs to a past that led to murders and deportations”.
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic considered that a compromise was always possible, warning the Kosovo Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
In particular, Belgrade says it fears a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia," he said, "it does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be taken exclusively by the Security Council, where its Russian ally had the right of veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
“Only one solution in the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia,” said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they have started: in the Security Council.”
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu replied that "the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking would be "in consultation" with the Westerners.
Bush pulls out an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference convened by him on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything possible to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must put an end to its settlement activities," Bush said, recalling both parties' obligations under the "road map" for peace that they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This name covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees expelled from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and thorough" and address all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, etc."
Going to the rostrum, Olmert pledged that the upcoming talks would be "direct and continuous" and that he would make "an effort to bring them to an end in the course of 2008".
Bush set at the end of 2008 the deadline for the implementation of his "vision of two states" between Palestine and Israel.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in this regard from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was a success for Washington, was at the origin of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offered Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it tackles the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", says Prince Saud in his interview with the Arab-speaking daily newspaper with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As every time in this type of fact various, official versions and rumors oppose each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was travelling on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., on Louise-Michel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in intervention but on patrol, and was travelling at 40-50 km/h, without a gyrophare," a police source explains.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, “not approved, therefore not allowed to run on the public road” (see below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was running “very fast”.
"She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority to the right," says a police officer.
The blood alcohol check carried out on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (before high, star windshield, bumper torn off) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the public prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "facts of manslaughter and non-assistance to persons in danger" to the IGPN, co-seized with the departmental direction of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor explained that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, excluded the responsibility of the police officers.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, heard on Sunday evening, confirmed "the police's version, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left."
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled until the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, there was a rumour in Villiers-le-Bel that the police had very quickly left the premises, thus not helping the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out "serious misconduct" on this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, on which one must be very careful," one police source said.
Libération met with an eyewitness of those moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows giving on the stage.
"We went down right away, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them," said this witness.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw "a police officer completely hagard, who was limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the fourth one was talking on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently the certainty that those present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to this witness, the aid arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left".
They also performed cardiac massages, in vain.
"I will not let it be said that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
Firefighters arrived right away.
Everything was done to try to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
Tension rises in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police repressed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf's establishment of a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement officials, according to witnesses.
The police responded by throwing stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers charged and injured lawyers.
Several were reportedly arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers of the Supreme Court's bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other demonstrations reportedly took place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement gathered the support of the religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president urged the population to send flowers to the judges who have pronounced themselves against the state of emergency and trash to those who have sworn in before Musharraf.
''Musharraf's promise no longer holds''
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly affected by the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday night.
It was to decide in the next few days on the legality of the presidential re-election on 6 October by indirect vote of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
''Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court'', the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president ''no longer holds'' after the establishment of a state of emergency, said Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
That he abandons his military uniform was expected by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied the country's insistent rumours that President Musharraf has been placed under house arrest by his deputy chief of armies.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unanticipated
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancies are not planned, according to a study conducted by the Institut national d'études démocratiques (Ined), forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the IUD still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, according to Ined.
The liberalization of contraception has nevertheless made it possible to improve fertility control, according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 years has increased from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated to the nearest month for one in five couples and if possible in spring, the season considered the most enjoyable to have a child.
Spectacular repair on space station
It took more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, essential for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky release that has accumulated records because of its duration, its remoteness from habitable modules, the speed with which it was conceived, tools "crafted" by astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that soon hosted the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of dock for laboratory modules.
But we must be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew's second task was therefore to move a 17.5-tonne solar panel power generation module, already present on the ISS, to put it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the redeployment of the module's solar panels, which have a wingspan of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged about a metre by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment was stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally to perform a shuttle Discovery control exit and then go to repair another solar panel with a defective rotation system, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to caracole at the end of the 30 meters length of the remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" of the Nasa.
Large, resistant, very skillful, he has a very developed torso and long arms.
At 46 years of age, this trained doctor was therefore given the task of "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he severed the wrong cable and installed some kind of "clamps" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a hockey mini-cane wrapped in insulation to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "briccoled" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was fully deployed before making an inventory of his tools and returning to the station interior.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to Shuttle Discovery for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
The EADS action is currently in sharp decline on the Paris stock exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its operational result forecast for 2007 due to delays caused by the slow progress of the A400M engine development, which conditions the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros including more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Because of these expenses, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result targets (EBITs) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without further details.
The group also indicated that the estimate of new expenses was consistent with the delay of six months.
As a reminder, EADS' operating result fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, that of the very large A380 carrier.
Initially, the group was planning a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
There will be no suspense, on Sunday, at the exit of the ballot box: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days before the general elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends a televised message to voters on public channels, which are already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the head of the United Russia list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is expected to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything out of it by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with handing over a new charge against the West accused of interference - its favourite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and want honest, transparent and open elections, free elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from counting.
She denounces a campaign tainted with pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganov says that "there have never been such dirty elections, even in Yeltsin's time."
After the crackdown on last weekend's protests, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protests, remains banned from visiting according to her lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovieticus"
Behind these unsustainable legislation are two much more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
Yesterday the official newspaper published the date of the first round of the presidential election, on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and of the all-powerful united Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, both legislative and presidential, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have maintained the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada centre.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St.Petersburg State University goes back further: civil society has fallen behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin has reconnected with the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population all the more since this new paternalism has not been followed by terror, but by some economic ease," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "willfully renounce their personal responsibility" which they had briefly demonstrated after the break-up of the USSR.
"What's the point of thinking?"
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite wants to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: “What is the point of thinking?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in open access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored over 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far only available for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or his successors.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
Since the ratification process by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow research to be carried out "in particular on the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, were opposed to the public opening of these nominative documents because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of the concentration camps or arrest warrants drawn up by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the civilians deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, possibly, to provide proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees handle tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
EU and India want free trade agreement in 2008
At present, indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of India's foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The EU Foreign Ministers gave a green light last April to the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of India's foreign trade.
The EU is also its largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU's ninth largest trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will greatly boost the two economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans", argued Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants trade annually for "€47 billion in goods" and for "€10 billion in services", said Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has "not yet reached its potential." On Friday, the EU and India meet for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering £10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday that it was anxious to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced a ten billion-pound offer at a base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty as to how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she says in a press release.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will thus be placed on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This seems to be the first time that BoE has put liquidity on the market at five weeks in an open market operation.
These are normally done within a week.
The BoE adds in its press release that it " stands ready to take further steps to maintain the rates" of interbank loans on a day-to-day basis in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, a higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the Bank of England's funds had been placed on the market with a large penalty rate that had deterred banks from using them.
According to rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the price of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine PS proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and New Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Listed in a socialist "niche" (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the national PS office, including the 50% increase in the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport cheque or the supervision of rents.
Since UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes to 115), the sitting was adjourned following the general discussion which gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between majority and opposition to Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of the MPs PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of its proposals in the form of amendments to the bill on amending finances considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following many rumours about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the Republic Festival of British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it's an honour to work with someone who has inspired the current movement of festivals in America," said Charlie Jones of C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is expected to be held from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been co-owner of the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" he ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We chose Philadelphia as a market and worked diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," says Jones.
“We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we got stuck in politics because of the current administration, says Charlie Jones.
"Happily, we were able to chat with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after standing out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a rural festival, while ours are more like urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both a impression of a rural festival to European and urban American."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports this event," said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are interesting enough to allow to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very large", as is the capacity of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed when going to press.
"Vineland will be rock-flavored, but the music will be varied, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," said Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood movie boards to Montreal when none other than Terminator opposes it...
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the legs of the "Governator"?
"You have to be careful, it is the industry that decides where it is going.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal favourable, she will go.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best," he says.
The festival race
For the moment, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of cinema from here.
The Oscar race has begun.
It will be at all the festivals of the Côté Ouest, whether it is Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, the question of presenting Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that directors make interviews.
The Dark Age had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock exchange? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks from the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands hoping for the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year the experts are not as sure as this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December on the stock market generally has a positive behaviour.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, since, given the current context, uncertainties are on the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock exchange gaining momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is nourished by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of guaranteed alternatives, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight to quality values in both long and short periods".
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behaviour, not free of volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulating inflationary pressures"
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"It's not the best thing," says the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish stock market index, has lost almost 4% since 8 November when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Intermoney analyst Juan Solana believes that Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points due to the reorganization of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert notes that things will be a little different this year as he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the feast of the Constitution (6 December).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Banco, estimates that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be provoked according to the information coming from the European Union as regards the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new maximum cots.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some builders "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While, Federico Olucha, d'Inversis Banco assures that the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they get started.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be the main factor in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do as well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only on two occasions in December was a bearish month.
The authentic year-end rally took place in 2003, an exercise in which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the breakthrough of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of winnings (for the moment the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds in computing on its rally at the end of the year.
Banque Populaire will open 200 offices open 12 hours Monday to Saturday
The Banque Populaire has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the popular brand Max, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8.30 p.m., and to open on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8.30 p.m.
Another group which has also reiterated several times that it would like to increase the hours of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
He is about to conclude an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of Banque Populaire will be decisive for other organizations to join or not to join this initiative, which coincides with business schedules.
This is precisely what the Banque Populaire is looking for.
Attract autonomous customers who circulate in these areas to shop in SMEs and shops on the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies located throughout Spain in about 18 months, since this is not the opening of new agencies but a renovation of those already existing.
To this end, the agency will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the customers of the various streets.
In this way, the amplification of schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new, more current design with more luminous colors.
The bank sales manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renovation does not involve major investments, but the hiring of staff, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid are the streets to be chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and public holidays.
In these agencies of PopularMax they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for its sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers', Rivero notes.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with a staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
We did it.
With this sentence Paolo Vasile, a delegated adviser to Telecinco, expressed yesterday his satisfaction, at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect tarnished his joy: 'What hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have decreased less', he said.
However, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we fell less'.
Telecinco finished yesterday with a 2.54% increase.
This gain has stabilized its loss at 15.66 per cent over the past year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (an additional 13%) thus amounts to 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
His rival Antena 3, who gave in yesterday 1.52% and who accumulates a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other communication companies listed on the stock exchange is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience '.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television channel to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the managing advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group.
In order for this announced data to be real, the television channel is expected to record a 3.6% increase in advertising billing for the current fiscal year compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, Antenne 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the fiscal year (up to $734.4 million), while net television revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors which annalists point to the best relative evolution of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the important payout it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
' We have the official compromise of giving to a minimum 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given securities with the 33% of Endemol '.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its benefit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explained, to the decline in projected revenue growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company decreased the forecast of Antenne's earnings 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and to 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the Congress' vote of amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the year ends.
Representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the effort made by Members of Parliament and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of organizations to ensure that markets function effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Law, involves the modernisation of financial markets, at a time when it strengthens the protection of the investor, improves the powers of the heads of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulations will enable financial advisory services to be provided for specialized social reasons as well as for natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (FICs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems can be added to regulated secondary markets, which compete with existing stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment service companies to disclose information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management on the market and requires them to keep a record of all transactions carried out by them, in order to facilitate control by CNMV.
Through the Congressional Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, one of which highlights that the titularized debts will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has proved itself with what happened with the high-risk American mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the management took advantage to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after, in 1977, was approved, the Royal Decree which delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to lend its services of marketing products and attracting new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index rose by five-tenths in November, up to 4.1%.
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the rate of inflation in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on the evolution of prices in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by offering data comparable over time and in quality to those produced in the United States.
The leading indicator is calculated using the same process used for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available for publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is indicative only, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data that will be released on December 14.
"The CPI will continue on relatively high levels"
The second vice-president and the minister of the economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "time figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes said in the Congress corridors that "although the figure is not good" the inflation differential of Spain regarding monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November “there was less surprise” than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economy said in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock EUR 42,000 million over three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen to over 50% up to £12,000 million (16,800 million euros) since it entered crisis in mid-September and had to resort to emerging credit from the Bank of England.
At that time he collected some record deposits above 25,000 million pounds, a figure that has gradually fallen in two and a half months due to the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government has offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the organization with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues of British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get that remaining 18,000 million pounds until reaching the target of 30,000 million.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for its stark advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend £50 million (about €70 million) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Association's offer, in which three other companies participate, including its favourite to save him from bankruptcy.
Totana mayor arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard today arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcia commune of Totana (of the Popular Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption fabric discovered this week.
ADe plus, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced me last May Juan Morales, current right-wing MP, and until then municipal councillor of the town hall, who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Channel, could be the 'leader' of this fabric.
Officers continue to search municipal and urban council premises and the possibility of further stops is not ruled out in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales's lawyer, the main suspect in the urban corruption fabric, discovered earlier this week, was charged.
As reported yesterday by the SER Channel to the lawyer of the MP 'People's Party' Juan Morales, he was arrested as he left Morales's home with important documentation in his possession relating to the frame.
Moreover, according to sources of the survey, the purpose of the investigation is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight detainees.
Bono agrees to be the head of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over the Congress if they win the elections
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
Thus the organizing secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this noon at the federal seat of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the former Minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
Moreover, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician of La Manche will be the candidate of the Socialist Group who will preside over the Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, who on 15 November last made public his decision not to run for office in the next general election and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the academic setting.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
Moreover, he pointed out that, although citizens already know who the economic vice-president will be if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to transform the House into a "house of respect and not insult or cry" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems lamentably that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know-how" and he did not want to pretend that he was already in his position so as not to fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might consider as "a domination".
Climate propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change is subject to persecution without mercy by both the sceptics of its predictions and those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron consistency.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has made a decisive contribution to the fact that Spain is the head of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto protocols.
Who are responsible for non-performance, in which sectors it has occurred, and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
Moreover, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it is going to take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be forced to do, what economic consequences this will bring.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has been no explanation and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing oneself and paying for it.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costing, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals.
Up to one hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him to be so dangerous in Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is a question of saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With phrases that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for electoral campaigns that does not speak, denounces and demands, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party and which does not pretend to move by bicycle or we cool off with the fan.
Mayor and local police chief of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcia town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and a hotel entrepreneur suspected of possible urban crimes, today informed the sources of the investigation.
The city councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the town hall, where at the moment many agents met, who also presented themselves to the office of city councillor of Urbanism and to the municipal management company of Industrial Sol and Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 dwellings, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial inquiry, which the Tribunal number 1 of Totana investigates.
The first six detainees have now moved to a judicial disposition.
According to the sources, the former Totana municipal councillor and currently independent MP of the PP party, Juan Morales, is the subject of the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was imputed, as well as the current fiancée of the former city councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and the entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, an agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operating Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies linked to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
So only one person was arrested in Totana, in sum, the owner of a well-known poultry business in the area, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcia commune of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that have been requalified and its plan would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction components.

Our Finnish correspondent gives us yesterday's comment in Finland's most important newspaper (PISA headlines above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that he appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The contents of the Philosophy course have challenged public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The guilty of the dead, a bachelor's student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that the teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat and he said that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools ".

A colleague reported on the introduction into the Criminal Code of offences related to Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft from a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros is considered only a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Stealing in a store for a value of up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (a section 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Taking part in a tumultuous fight involves a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the traffic of CDs would involve a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the authors ' permission is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).

My attending doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less '.
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what the colleagues earn.
The study was carried out using tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image Group of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his companion failed".
Researchers observed that when both individuals assumed that they were receiving the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, activation was greater.
I don't know if that conclusion required so much science.
The Balkan Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will go away with bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former leader serbobosnio Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in this list whose documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'Carla's list' (2006, not shown exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor in Belgrade in New York who pursues fugitive criminals and puts pressure on the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What assurance does it suit me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, involves a significant expenditure which will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, seniority of the driver's licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
Here, escoger el seguro de automóvil adecuado es included más difícil que elegir el modelo de vehículo.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise materializes in an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in return becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a loss.
The premium is the insurance price, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, gender, seniority of the driver's licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the rating.
This is why people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower rate of claims due to their prudence.
Similarly, by using censuses, the companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
Here we will describe the most significant variables when choosing one or other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various disadvantages when entering into a contract with insurance at an affordable price, as may be the low level of experience in driving and the seniority of the driver's licence.
Although the ideal way to be well insured is to provide insurance at any risk, other, more cost-effective options exist.
The most anticipated drivers can opt for any risk insurance with deductible, so that they get insurance coverage at any risk but at a more accessible price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim paid by the customer will be determined according to the value of the premium, which will be higher and the amount will be lower," says Luis Noguera, the Spanish manager of First Europa, an online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid claims as far as possible, since this will affect the premium, which can reduce the insurance price in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the company's basic rate.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses ", clarified Noguera.
After 25 years, it becomes easier for drivers to make a contract with insurance, since the loss rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is preferable to choose any risk insurance with deductible.
"Normally young people cannot take advantage of the experience acquired in advance after an accident", says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable for the client to negotiate insurance at any risk, as long as his or her economic situation permits.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be those with the lowest loss rate, because the increases will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be any risk insurance with deductible (which could be 300 euros), or third-party insurance extended from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more relaxed conduct and they have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury to assume a larger amount of franchises," Justice Luis Noguera.
For retirees, any risk insurance with deductible is preferable (by being 150 euros), or extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible losses, but also because it represents a great expense, which is why it is essential to study properly the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth final
The Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow measure up next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point that they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to classify themselves.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to make sure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass him.
These two Group D games will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as the Milan AC is to play the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the final of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most awaited result, although both teams will try to get out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would remain first and ensure a better cross in the eighths of the final.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to rank if Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but she will not be able to compute only on this because with nine points the games come back to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who have good hope of ranking for the eighth finals for the second time at the Champions League, after having been beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the overtimes (1-0).
While waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to the Shakhtar, in case the Celtic loses, to rank for the eighths of the finals to be able to continue the league of UEFA champions.
And it is that the Benfica, although it is last and without possibilities to continue the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls initiated their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, ahead of about 20,000 spectators, since the band dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice ' (Victoria Beckham), ' Scary Spice ' (Melanie Brown), ' Baby Spice ' (Emma Bunton), ' Sporty Spice ' (Melanie Chisholm) and ' Ginger Spice ' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting was "bright".
Around 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which is told the story of the band that raged at the end of 1990.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes their main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls staged the bracelets that 'Posh Spice''s husband gave them, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the public who filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days before.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show".
'Sporty Spice' who left the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and who caused the group to dissolve two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a press interview, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feelings have changed, the feeling for Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, "things have worked out and we appreciate each other very much".
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last showed up in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of babysitters was waiting for them.
They count to her five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will exhibit in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
In Madrid they will show off on 23 December.
The new gas affair between Russia and Ukraine is raising the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas ferments between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risks of repercussions on oil exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are transported by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel oil, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two caused a decrease in supplies to the countries of the EU.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow arises after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia's monopoly gas supplier, tried in vain to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase as planned, its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said that this would involve Ukraine, a 40% increase in import costs from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas flows," announced Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinkh to the Reuters news agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused the interruption of Gazprom supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, resulting in higher prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest stocks of gas, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve the checks to be made on its extra-Community employees to check whether they have criminal precedents, the Monitoring Committee said.
The warning of the Reviser General, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Mr Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health had no precise data on the number of overseas workers employed.
His report nevertheless highlighted other decisive checks, correctly carried out on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The General Reviewer conducted checks on extra-Community personnel following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, an Iraqi-born doctor in the service of the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after driving with his jeep, in the doors of the main terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October, as suspected of being involved in various attempts to explode cars in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out checks on criminal precedents, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office of Criminal Oversight, thus allowing employers to undertake controls over various countries.
"Although we have discovered that some personnel information has been verified, this is not done every time."
Mr Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks he would do himself, but he also added: "Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on some overseas staff is available to health services.
Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland said it is "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls can identify employees who may commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring any added value."
Scottish health authorities reported employing 1,161 overseas workers, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the General Reviewer pointed out that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, partly because of problems with the identification of staff members with indeterminate contracts, who might or might not choose to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures for health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its policy and system of pre-employment controls for overseas health service staff.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, together with the Health Committees, would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be published next month, and commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, valid for all employees, including overseas workers.

The 50th anniversary director, having shot films like Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel of Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of Crystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud to receive this award named in honour of star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney allowed people like me access to the cinema," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."
"I was admired by this great actor today, I was extremely honored"
The Oscars of the independent film, better known as "the Bifas" are awarded by a jury composed of directors, actors and festival organizers.

Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 activists involved in organizing cells planning an impending attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clergy and armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against the allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in Oriental Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 military personnel to protect the sites, following a failed Al Qaeda attack in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper citing a statement by the Minister of the Interior said that 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell headed by a "missile launch expert" who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
Twenty-two of the detainees appear to have plotted the murder of clergymen and armed forces.
The government has asked the clergy to do more against Saudis directed in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting against the Allied Forces and against the Muslim Shiite government allied to the United States, considered heretic according to the hard line of Saudi Sunny.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clergymen have worked with the authorities to support the royal family policy that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Major efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five months," said the Minister of the Interior's spokesman on state television.
Among the detainees, there are 16 members of the Medina organized into a "media cell" to promote "takfiri thought", the ideology of Muslim radicals Sunni which supports the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 are accused of having subsidized the activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit has shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those of the Earth, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with slower rotation, led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature area warm enough to melt lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the probe of the European Space Agency, which studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of the potential future of the Earth due to catastrophic climate changes.
Professor of Physics at Oxford University, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We are beginning to understand why Venus' climate is so different from Earth's, although the planets themselves are almost similar.
"Our new data allows us to establish a scenario according to which billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to the Earth, perhaps even with a living area."
Enriched uranium sequestered by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was sequestered by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer stated that three persons had been arrested and that the equipment was currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the merchandise would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to anything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to the challenge as a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates have finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who have registered their questions, submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, 28 November, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as that from another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked the Democrats for their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers were very much reflective of the conditions of the Republican party, the candidate for the next election.
We don't know what criteria CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose You Tube clips to show candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest of a single theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the forts for Republicans.
CNN asked some electors to call when they would hear pleasant things: The board noted increases in approval when candidates spoke rudely.
The longest and hardest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr Romney, who led the important early elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his term as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the ex-Governor of Massachusetts, of employing illegal immigrants at home.
The two fighters became particularly ferocious when asked whether they would be willing to promote "amnesia" (offering clandestines a regular status and the possibility of becoming citizens).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to delve deeper into this topic.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they started fighting immigration before and more incisively than the others.
In general, candidates, at least as far as immigration is concerned, have the same opinions: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, combined with the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears towards the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or to minimize the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether to put water in the nose should be considered torture.
One speaker asked whether the candidates believed in the Bible in its entirety.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure to believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
It was not expected that Mike Huckabee - in pole position in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - would declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When one insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he began to laugh and said that Jesus was too chic to stand for election.
The human race remains unusually open to anything.
Mr Huckabee's return to Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious research of subsidies carried out by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistling during Wednesday's debate.
These two have emerged from nothingness, thanks to the fact that the two protégés of the party cannot agree to decide who is the best known and more traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly thanks to a message of success on the American grandeur thus bringing the leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labourers' pains
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole to sink into; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the tendency of British scandals, it is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills of politicians, no extra marital finger sucked.
But now a revelation attests that a wealthy businessman would have hidden for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister turned back on his election plan, stupidly insulting British intelligence that opinion polls have not influenced his decision, and that he hoped to offer a compact and efficient government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr Brown turned from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The acquisition of Northern Rock, a troubled bank on the edge of the crack, has demonstrated a flaw in guidance and poor judgment in an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from the tax authorities, revealed an incredible administrative bourde.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: they proclaimed that being a minister of defence is for them a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of suspicious donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of Labour (and his former leader of vigilance) have made them resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is bound for the exit.
However, governments can come to a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and don't trust them, but usually leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he risks the suspension: the public administration no longer works; the cabinets of ministers take stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and without any further objective.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his superior lieutenant.
The problems relating to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, relate to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's misfortunes, such as the long investigation of party funds "cash for the members of the House of Lords", voters might think the opposite.
But the difficult situation that Mr. Brown is facing is not so tragic as to seem.
The gaffes are not so monstrous as the members of the Tories party make it seem.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to realize the Stalinist tendencies of Mr.Brown always, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal about political donations is a good example.
Abrahams, a very particular person, who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it's not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of politicians' big subsidizers are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr Watt, who stated that he was aware of Mr Abrahams' programmes, without knowing that it was illegal, would therefore have to be questioned, as would Jon Mendlesohn, the fund-raising officer who had talked about questionable donations in October.
But so far Mr.Brown is not involved: There is nothing to suggest that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival at the government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative flaw, but he did not draw attention to the fact that decision-making power rests on something he knows well, using a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chair for the independent committee of the Standards of Public Life, which has been without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financial side of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to abandon its particular financial relationship with confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a partisan such as Mr Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to win back the voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate irreproachable integrity and solid skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see fanned fins, swirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measures unrecoverable or unrecoverable balance sheet shares, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in consumer credit, partly because of the weakness of cardholders.
It's still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% in the third quarter is almost a point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration of the rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the laws in the United States in 2005 regarding personal bankruptcy caused a sharp fall in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses to credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
TowerGroup's Dennis Moroney, a research company, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links of infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debt now that fair mortgages have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of cash rather than the value of wealth, and therefore the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily led to a change in borrowers' credibility.
They could even bring benefits to credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if property costs less than the value of the loan; therefore, credit card debt would become a priority to pay back.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with greater flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of rapid stock resumption.
"We're not going to wake up one morning and reassess all the loans," said Gary Perlin, director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a strong risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Pay close attention to the dorsal fins..
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were to testify to their roles in relation to a fraud committed by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially declared themselves innocent of the seven charges of alleged collusive fraud committed by Fastow in 2000 in a secret financial scam in order to enrich themselves in spite of their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all found themselves guilty of fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have become famous throughout Great Britain because of the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains a pending issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 led Fastow to understand that he was the subject of the government's investigation into the Enron debacle.
The accusations against the bankers, nicknamed the "Natwest Three" claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his ex-right-hand Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of a Fastow-controlled Enron partner, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, who helped him rig bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as zero, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the subsidiary bank for £1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as an interest in this company.
According to the accused, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But the truth is that $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is in prison for six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following the payment of a $1 million bail each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, previously the seventh largest national company, in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even offer its bogus speculations as profitable.
The collapse resulted in thousands of layoffs, more than $60 billion in market value losses and more than $2 billion in retirement plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former general president Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to over 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were unsuccessful because of her death due to a heart attack last year.
No money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money,
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel autonomy to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats as it is more a family-owned plane or for the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at last Friday's Gulfstream booth at the Millionaires' Fair, a four-day consumer incentive orgy held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
Besides Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to cars filled with diamonds like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was looking for a bright orange Porsche, displayed next to his stand.
"It's a pretty car, but nothing comparable to our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, such as Dallas"
"We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar from the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like Saudis in the 1970s, Japanese in the 1990s, Russians emerge as the world's largest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are composed of 103000 Russian millionaires who are worth $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists from the economic and financial research center.
(The World Bank reported that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweller.
She participated in the show for the first time with the Russian distributor, Le Groupe Bijoutier de Soho.
"Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune."
Walking in the living room on Sunday evening, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declare to be like their customers, millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and tried to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms Yumatova, who grabbed her haute couture dress like a veteran of the red carpet like Joan Rivers.
The show seems above all to be aimed at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue in the corks to come to a huge warehouse where are exposed Cadillac Escalades, platinium canifs, Mövenpick ice creams, personalized billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and cuddly bears Gund.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands," said Gijrath, proudly sitting at the Royal factory stand for Dutch porcelain Delf, in front of a hand-crafted Raimbrant wall painting on blue tiles.
“It is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling”
In fact, sellers have stated here that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years old are too much according to Russian standards) have already passed from brilliant logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, either millionaires, millionaires' emissaries or tourists, walk through the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton inlaid with gold threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said that he sold to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be inlaid with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, does not necessarily drive with such tires," said Mr. Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr.Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, except in cash," he said.
"There's more than you might think"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the booth of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company built four stands representing British telephone booths, filled with counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passersby arrested to throw masses of banknotes, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or pocketing a few millions.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel a millionaire," said Mr. Karyev.
Unaccredited surgeon suspected of homicide in New Jersey
It was Thanksgiving Eve when Ronald Livingston looked through the window at Just a Little Healthier restaurant and watched an ambulance stop at the doors of the white Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol arrived.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," Mr.Livingston, a restaurant manager, said on Wednesday.
That's when I realized someone died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the head of the Newark police department.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, which the police have not yet identified, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are waiting confidently for the results of the toxicological tests which, unfortunately, will take time, but which should solve this mysterious death which saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo was the assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," McCarthy said about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"she was like a pit bull"
"she would have done everything to protect me"
McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she left two 14- and 11-year-old sons, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesman for the Union County Public Prosecutor's Office, Theodore J. Romankow, stated that the detectives were trying to determine whether Ms.Arroyo died due to an unauthorized surgical operation.
"It's a possibility to consider."
"the investigation continues."
The authorities reported that they arrived at her house at about 3 p.m.
And found Miss Arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Miss Castro's house where a faded rose lies in the narrow cemetery in front, and a barking Dalmatian in the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two all-terrain bikes hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since her arrival in Newark 25 years ago in the New York Police Department, Ms.Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
"She said, "You have to pay attention to this," he said.
"She was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates associated with the strong global stock exchange.
The shares were exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm down the credit conditions, subsequently reducing the interest rates promoted by the soothing statements of the vice president of the American central bank.
Stock markets explode in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kohn, number two after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in troubled financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets in view of these new credit pressures, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence has partly "inverted some improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
In the event that this severe turbulence persists, it would increase the likelihood of future rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into the U.S. markets, and that further decreases in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also allowed Wall Street to calm down with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest decline in real estate sales for the month of October.
The repercussions of this financial tumult were accentuated by the statement of Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will fire 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to the losing bets of real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in Londres, where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones' industrial average increased by 331 points, or 2.55% concluding at 13.289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points, or 2.7% concluding at 6306.2 adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the reappearance of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted following the strong demand for an auction of monthly sorting funds from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and to inject further funds into London's financial markets, causing credit tensions, led to the fact that the monthly tri-borrowing rates "Libor" the British banks, have caused their highest growth since last September, at 6.59% following a sharp rise since 12 November.
England faces an appeal for judgment against the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We face two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the number 6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in such a broad context as the first test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the breeders who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the CEO of England, begins to fill out the application forms to become a national breeder, at least on a part-time basis.
The one who won't win the #6 bib will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is unfair as well.
It is never easy to annihilate what allows a man to get to the top of his profession while another will never get to the bottom level, sometimes because of lack of luck more than because of lack of ability.
It is not only at the cricket that the selection is difficult, because at the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is the time for Bopara to emerge?
Is it just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, who choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both new executives with good degrees, professional, should be promoted: but there is room for only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the correct level of a cricketer unless given at least one chance?
The figures are important not only in decisions, but also in opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the one-day cricketer.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in good shape and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 laps to win a spot.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
If it is Shah or Bopara who will play at the Asgiriya stadium, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and did well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricketer of the Test, despite the fact that his double cent against Australia in Australia could still be underestimated.
The probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable debut in the 88-year test in Bombay, 32 cents of first class against six for Bopara, who at 22 years old is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at launch.
But Shah did only ten laps in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test to Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that, the immediate rejection by the breeders when Vaughan again in shape, claimed his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his so obvious impulses in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently knocked himself on a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, the English sponsor.
He reported only slight injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his partner who was looking at him from afar, to ask him if 'he had seen this?'
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his spinning pace allows him to do services that suit him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right moment is another.
Perhaps this is the true art of selection?
I would be apt to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, it will be him who will play this weekend.
Buses take people back to work, and fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dumping these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope that the city has returned to normality.
Some returned to fight the militants who distanced them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before Damascus arrived 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now."
"They say that the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who has forced his men to go away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from working.
His neighbours from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the militia helped by the United States, allowed him to drive Al Qaeda out of the west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his house north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited the citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm coming home today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many say they have attracted the growing calm of the capital since the American troops arrived, and to the view of continuous formation of well-armed "groups of citizens involved" and collaborating with the American military to defend their neighbourhood.
But still others say they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old, father of three children, expressed the suspicion felt by all about visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, who allegedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return home.
More than two and a half million people are said to have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
"We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," said the retired Sunni.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left."
The decrease in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis were driven out of the Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
There is concern that a sudden influx of refugees may further increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest state conducts vocational training, and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrians, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest state federated, by self-derision, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland training system, which is placed fifth in the training instructor of the Institute of German Economy in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies there by a double or even a triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Saarland also leads the country's children to higher-than-average schools - many of them without a Gymnasium diploma.
"In Saarland, we take advantage of the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, an expert in training at IW.
More than one in five young people obtain their degree in a vocational school, so Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Education of Sarrois forced the higher schools to undertake a marketing campaign in engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government has introduced in the entire federated state comparative tests.
For children to start learning earlier, the last year of day care is free of law - a model that in the meantime other states also copy.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether students' performance is improving in a sustainable way.
In PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of students at risk decreased from 29 per cent to 20 per cent.
In total, however, the Saarland has not improved as much as other states.
Bavarians are doing better.
And in spite of the sarrois, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise we could gain points in this field.
For the neighbor's language is compulsory in high schools - even if the sarrois are not French.
Chávez sets watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon tick-tac other than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will raise the timer by half an hour in the South American country.
In the meantime, Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated, due to a new law, the watches will be set at less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
Anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, due to a case of hostages.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would have no relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I can't, already only because of my dignity," said Chávez, who hastened a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's negotiating mandate on the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe allegedly "cracked in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, criticized Chávez on Sunday.
Also in Spain Chávez is in every mouth.
A new mobile phone ringing is a raging phenomenon in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded from the internet.
It was pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was upset by the constant arrests of left-wing populists and who told him to remain silent.
A fall in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, a real wage loss threatens German employees this year, according to a prognosis.
Experts have cited a variety of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease on their pay slip in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies in the weak wage development, the increase in value added tax and rising food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research, in the newspaper "Bild".
New charges could also arise for unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the expected decline in unemployment insurance of 3.3 per cent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, in the words of the SPD politician.
On Tuesday, it was known that the boom in food and oil prices had pushed the rate of inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from year to year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like the Earth than we thought so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind whirlwinds at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightnings on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has today proved this - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lightnings on Venus burst at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud in cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of cyprine, lightnings would have revealed life on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the corner stone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If life has been there, it must have been at a very old date in history," explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
Today there should be little living thing on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the infernal twin of the Earth, but she's still a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venusian research, since no probes had been on their way to explore this planet since the 1990s.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" do not only highlight the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the commonalities with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than assumed at first sight.
Thus, in addition to the wind whirlwinds already known at the north pole, researchers found a cloud whirlwind at the south pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet described as an evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it rotates much more slowly on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly reminds the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets were formed under similar conditions.
Of the two, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth as carbonate, it constitutes most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands the end of the quarrel between the parties over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs for the attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and is the great coalition to close the quarrel about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue," said Köhler at Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the welcome of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even though I have respect for differences between cultures," said Köhler.
It is well known that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the accusations that it would organise a new policy for China.
The German Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional policy of one China.
"China also knows," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier complained, in particular, about the CDU's "frontline policy" on foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama was welcomed to the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in German-Chinese relations.
Thus the Chinese government has not only decommissioned the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to Spiegel, has also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
China's Head of Government Wen Jiabao now demands German Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the reception of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refused to allow European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official duties, thus supporting Wen Jiabao's position.
The words and acts of the Dalai Lama would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fights with the police, shootings, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not break out on the streets by violence, the German Minister of the Interior demanded.
Burning barricades, breakers shooting at the police with shotguns: after the serious riots of young people in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not form as much at home as it does at home and defuses itself in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "Neue Presse" in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated states and the communes were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, it already shows its first successes."
However, it would be too early for an end to the alert.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems or from the point of view of urban planning as in France.
In the northern cities of Paris, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned down.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German government were demanded by the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasises that the unemployment quota for young people under 25 years of age with an immigrant background would be above average.
Above all, more training places should be provided.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective".
The President of the Turkish communities added, however, that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many immigrant youth also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "But we must still be careful."
Young people should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training.
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with searchlights.
The authorities on duty reported three arrests, as well as a few burned cars and garbage.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit from the suburbs.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following night, the troubles were overflowing in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first members of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
Angela Merkel's empire.
The utopian entry of the Chancellor shows that the coalition has finished with the bottom - and that there is nothing more to expect from her.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After his desolating intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should ultimately be governed by it.
The criticism of too much focus on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said, and only showed that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, she made it clear to everyone how accurate this criticism was.
There was no concrete interest or little feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a weightless politician, who flees into foreign policy and even there remains in the near vicinity.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it welcomes the Heiligendam agreements again and again, but does not say how the climate objectives will have to be achieved in our country.
Even self-praising - having so little modesty, the leader of the CDU would have refused it again two years ago.
Now it clings to formulas all made, that growth would affect people.
By this she destroys her image as a pragmatist, which solves problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the empire of the Angela cloud, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He has a few additional sentences left for that.
In this respect, it is indicative of the number of times she makes lapsus when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three startups to utter a half-precise sentence.
She's tipping in unknown terrain, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the Youtube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a hard offensive battle - and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already breaking out on the first subject.
He allegedly made New York a "refuge for illegals", criticises Mitt Romney against his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
"I would say that his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants," says Giuliani, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing undocumented immigrants.
The candidates go up for the attack: as the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debates on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users sent via Youtube are barely more than blowers.
"It was with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," said John McCain to his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also being taught vigorously by Vietnam veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", an interrogation method where drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign in the meantime go beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture can be seen in the reactions of the common room in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whether conservative values are being praised or future tax increases are being denied, applause flows into the auditorium.
This is where again the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
"I made a mistake at that time," explains Romney contrit and apologizes to the base and the television audience for having been a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, passes through a knot when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian clothes.
One day after his withdrawal as head of the armed forces, Pakistani powerman Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of military rule ended.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf was appointed on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live to the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the Nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his office as chief of the armed forces to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and had thus bent on international pressure, particularly that of the United States.
Eight years after his takeover by a putsch without bloodshed, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By this withdrawal from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf decreed on 3 November.
Already shortly after his inauguration Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another demand of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers from its ranks, had last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of northern Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were injured.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded on a street near the border with Afghanistan.
The Krautrock fathers are coming back.
The supergroups of Germany of the seventies play again: the three members of the group Harmonia took their console again in a concert in Berlin.
For their return they appeared recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much more known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced in the evening poster.
Each one has his little box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
He is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old boy and in possession of a laptop and guitar.
To the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes it inadvertently adds to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves too much.
The fact that the band Harmonia plays again assured some months among the fans of Krautrock.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, of course, the name reasons in the collective memory of pop, but in no way so long-lasting so that this group misses so painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn't German also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the 1970s?
All the more so since what is termed "Krautrock" has always been more popular in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the 2003 Echo Award to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, the audience saw German pop faces questioning.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the pan-gyric eulogy, the astonishment had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the stage of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the unknown is the only one.
The memory is thus already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during this period the impact power felt was much weaker than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
First we played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly unfurled in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, who was perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an ancient Weser farm, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Kommune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
More like an artistic existence like Spitzweg.
Supposedly there was in the trash a fanion of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many kept Harmonia away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next one was "De Luxe".
As serene and modest as music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest of dead wood was not used alone in search of oneself.
The CD "Live 1974" which has just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, as someone thinks they remember.
Rother expressed at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and secured his existence with albums like "Flammend Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever had.
We owe the Griessem Live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His Grönland label has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as a German contribution inherent in contemporary music.
Neu! had already been dug up on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
Harmonia's physical resurrection takes place at the Maison des cultures du monde in Berlin.
Publicly funded, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire margin of fluctuation of the influence of Krautrock would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence hovers in the room in the midst of singular sounds: "The only real music, you listen to the future".
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the room of the farm.
Projections of other black and white photographs of bazaar-wired tools are used to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvised.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and to the battery, to draw to the instruments unheard of sounds thanks to the instruments with effects built by themselves.
Today, electronic music resembles electronic music.
The three in large technical fignoleurs.
Even the choir of the house will not change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never been about rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in the music conservatories (Can), in the technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia too is no longer irritated by this now.
But what is most self-evident will be carefully covered on the stage.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
It can hit someone's nerves (?) or give fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "The Deadly Peace", two films once again tackle the Balkan war.
But both don't convince.
Either the projects rely too much on action and on the exchange of senseless shots or, on the contrary, they are too weary.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news is, of course, that war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is precisely there, in the most gloomy hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because far too many nice and futile roles in films with feelings for women and far too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch still "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why should today's films be as long and confused as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He gives a magnificent representation full of twinklings: in the background, his war reporter character Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a ruined monument at his decline, has nevertheless kept visible remains of his former charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Lead Peace", which is also coming out this week, the endless continuation of failed films about the Balkan war.
The film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from the Kosovar free-shooters, in whom one of them falls in love quickly.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not for once presented as the sole causes of all evils, this film as flat as a TV film is lost far too quickly in action and the exchange of senseless shots.
It remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why in the end there has never been a real good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioned to track down the high war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, with another director and another writer (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go in a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply do not let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynical with a heart, as he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute to him a romantic adventure with a Bosniak murdered later.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, achieves that NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have not succeeded in five years: catching the war criminal and leaving him for just revenge to the Bosnian Muslims.
It is so bad that the Hague International Court should be brought before it for a crime against cinematic logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) not to conduct the hunt intensively enough because of secret political agreements.
But the well-meaning and the wicked are this time so similar that a famous poem by Brecht comes to the idea.
The one speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's working table: "Compating, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiring it is to be wicked."
Movies such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but they insinuate how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been any good films about South Africa before.
This is true every time: when a star hangs out on a crisis home or on a minefield, there comes out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are simply too close in time.
In any case, decades have always passed before Hollywood could make a good holocaust movie with "The Schindler List".
Some films still have to mature - those that today are worth classical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have in no way been celebrated unanimously in their time as masterpieces.
But maybe we know about it today too simply too much about the conflicts of the world, where every hecatomb comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And that delights writers with the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not being" or "Dictator" have actually become so good too because Lubtisch and Chaplin still didn't know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps we must have the sarcastic and distant artistic look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It is only because certain things never change".
"Great cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be horrifiedly murdered and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust reaps the criticism for the cancellation of the Olympiads.
The mayor's setback with Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympic Games was met in politics and the economy with virulent criticism.
Many want to continue fighting for the Waterfront Games.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of opportunities.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, the chief director of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, described a drop-out on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
Recently, no other project had deployed as much motivational forces in the city as the Olympiads' idea.
"Without this objective, the political-sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same way."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new, longer-term starting point, "which takes as its starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday at his previous statements, according to which Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It's not Hamburg that decides to apply for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the expected decision of the Sports Federation in early December on Munich's bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us, that in the period of time we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance."
However the dream does not definitely belong to the past, said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
From this the impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A withdrawal of the candidature would also be in contradiction with the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiades as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first named Hamburg as a candidate city in the past few weeks.
The SPD fraction of the mayor criticized the Senate for not using this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook was refused by the Senate for years because it played the Olympiad card and excluded the construction of housing," said delegates of the SPD Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded for the Petit Grasbrook a plan integrated into the Olympiads and a later use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics would have aroused great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had broken against Leipzig.
They're not Warhols' cases.
The one who connects the Swedish concepts and wooden case, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol's list of works.
A large part of the ninety Brillo-Boxes of "Stockholm Type" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" doubted a few months ago the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm today leads to a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hulten museum donated in 1995 to the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Stockholm Type", which circulate on the international art market.
Ancient history is entangled, a disconcerting chain of artistic and curatoric productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the blue-white red design of the "Brillo" powdered soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of cases made of carton: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the carton factory Brillo.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce a few wooden boxes in Brillo in Sweden, which were not in fact exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden boxes that at the time would have entered by right into the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the name "Stockholm Type".
Some of them have reached more than $100,000 in auction sales.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hulten museum wrongly claimed that about one hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would then have given to him.
In fact, Hulten's 105 cases were produced in Malmö in 1990 alone, for an exhibition in St Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, next to the museum's six Brillo-Boxes, three other Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and sanded, and then a white oil paint brush was applied.
The texture of the copies dating back to 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the paint was directly applied without a background layer on the laminated panels, using a roll of paint - moreover, it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic.
"These crates were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," suggests Moderna Museet Director Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come up with another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six crates in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
Already in July the Authentication Board announced, of course, that it would investigate the "heavy accusations" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap cases.
But since then we've had an inexorable silence there.
Manila Rebel Soldiers Abandon
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers abandoned the same soldiers who had retreated from a hotel in Manila and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to power had shortly before stormed the hotel using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had cut themselves off for hours in the building.
About half of them were in court on Wednesday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclipse with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who normally had to watch them, had apparently deserted in his favour and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Troops loyal to the government capped the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People have had enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was in command before the Scouts' elite unit, said that other units in the army soon wanted to join the march.
Critics of the regime had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The Manila finance district had already been the scene of the attempted mutiny of some 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke almost 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts to putsch against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a principal shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured a participation of more than 20 per cent of the Versatel telecommunications company.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as communicated by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the share capital would be held.
We had previously speculated on a buyback.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step we seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet communicated.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institute would only hold the money for a third part, it is said on the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a stake of almost 10 percent in the mobile telephone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million on the stock exchange.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile telephony products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," said a spokesperson for the United Internet.
Both companies founded the MSP equity company in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
At the moment, both companies want to feel satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not make use of their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent at Freenet, United Internet confided on Thursday.
However, it was learned that the two companies would allow themselves all the options open, especially to increase participation in SA Freenet.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
Poker still difficult to predict on Freenet, which has been going on for months, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers bound by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
United Internet Holding and Drillisch had a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01 per cent to date.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring about an additional four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
