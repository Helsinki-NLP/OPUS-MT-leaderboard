Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours and be the fourth U.S. President in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be presented to him, among other things, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and will have a busy program.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the very first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then includes an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will be crowned in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, but only the third who will be awarded the prize within the Committee itself.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he is receiving this award as a president who is currently waging a war in two countries.
He reinforced the war effort a few more days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to emphasize.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of 10 million Swedish krona (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate it to charitable organizations, but he has not yet decided which ones in practice.
His busy program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at first.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that this is not a price for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as the announcement was made, he said it would be an "invitation to act".
A defender of nature accused of blackmail
The police in Litom+ice charged the president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litom+ice with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction works procedures and asked for money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesman for the police in Litom
Lubomír Studnička is the president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litom
He is currently in detention and faces up to three years' imprisonment.
Waste sorting bins are not in the scent in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packages, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on sorting bins at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you'd have to take several minutes to find the right dumpsters.
I don't mean to say we wouldn't sort out the garbage at all in Brno.
But I have the impression that the city councillors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially given the number of dumpsters dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city center?
This is a whole science, which mainly requires time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found right now is Moravia Square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his co-workers don't blame me, but it doesn't sound damn good to me.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it's not a sinecure either.
So, finally, many of my friends don't sort their garbage.
Laziness.
It gives them a trot to get to the dumpsters.
I'm not surprised about them.
I myself, after a party, offered to throw away a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any colored dumpsters on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place by taking the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
It is after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city best, right?!
It is probably that the socialists of Brno are not too interested in ecology and so-called aesthetics.
They prefer to buy from the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city all over the country, instead of buying a few extra dumpsters and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad to have been able to strengthen my impression with official statistics after having dragged a moment on the internet.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravia region.
Parubek's budget has taken away money from pensions and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's advice, farmers or civil servants may lack money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on State debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will borrow for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting the problems back on track, undermining the ground," said Janota.
It is important to know that the interest on the borrowed money is increasing and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state has no real choice as to where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social assistance or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those who the left has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will receive them and must not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater debt of the state - next year it will not miss 163 billion in the caisses, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will grow more and more rapidly and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The state will need money to pay it back and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government did in its deficit-free package.
It will also miss five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly sections already decided and started and it is not possible to modify the projects in order to reduce costs.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major projects, and the withdrawal of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very adroitly - it will draw from the dividends of the ČEZ (supplier and distributor of electric energy), which the state mainly owns and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of the dividends is never certain and that in no case is it a well without substance.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement pension accounts or to serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 per cent of GNP according to EU rules.
And that's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations to the victims of communism and crimes, or even savings in housing, has fallen by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the department's side or, at worst, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a shortfall of $100 million in the $2 billion state fund project, which is intended to track on-line the expenditures of each administration.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just one button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them into staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware company in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and it was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is by no means fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, of a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to devices during 2012.
The shortage of snow in the mountains bothers hoteliers
Desert runways are not a problem only for ski lift operators.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users go through the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, it's better not to hesitate too much to book.
If we give priority to savings and the quality of accommodation comes only afterwards, then we can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers of Špindler only offer one week stays for the New Year.
I think they're going to try to place them for a while, but they're going to give up too and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will rapidly decrease," Jandura estimated.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
Christmas week is of most interest to us at the moment, it is not completely sold.
We still have half the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared some cheaper last minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours manager Petr Schiefert.
The tourist agency of the Vrchlabí can also offer the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February go as well, the remaining winter stays sell out moderately.
This year's interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to start falling.
No one wants to spend the winter in the snowless mountain.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will also be complete," says Schiefert.
On the other hand, the occupation of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sn+kou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places left for New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There is a great interest during the Polish holiday of January and February is also selling well," informs Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the central car park of Jánské Lázně is also 80 percent complete during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupancy at present.
February is a little weaker for now but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše will certainly grow has indicated the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
However, Krkonoše hoteliers should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be cooler and if there is precipitation, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But later, the weather is expected to warm up, informs Ji+Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: Repetition Is Mother of Wisdom · Global Voices
It even becomes comical, the hard work with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of wise, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan question, which he considered to be very simple.
When he finally let his doctrine sweat so eagerly awaited, it turned out that he had copied it to carbon paper since Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A New Road Forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements to an Iraq consumed by civil war as being "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which was based on the recommendations of the campaign commanders, was the only one possible and likely to be so successful that the newspapers at present do not speak at all of Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, but, objectively speaking, he left his successor with a much more favourable final situation than one could expect.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan the miracle will happen again
It was again the campaign commanders who asked him for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House's reluctance in spite of the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, he at least swindled the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to extirpate the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though he originally had 10,000.
What brings the most problems to Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this whole process within three years. Obama's entire doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that a halving increase will bring the same results as the increase in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out by the exact opposite — no one can be relied on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing their leadership on a day-to-day basis, depending on what suits them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only a powder behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity about the relationship, which is further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "early-to-act state", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
Obama's strategy's time horizon is perplexed by his voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart out of reality can be convinced that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of war with a view to their "return home" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will consider it the indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the strengthened sanctions do not affect Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of resolving the problem through the use of military force.
This will have to be answered, for example, at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each such solution will, however, result in a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
Obama's only rustin is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential election and therefore there is still enough time for him to plan a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
High-ranking executive employees at Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced this in response to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 chief executives will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell for five years.
Actions may be withdrawn from management in the event that they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort to link rewards with long-term performance to Wall Street.
I guess Wall Street is well aware of the global meaning that needs to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs bank became the target of criticism after setting aside almost $17 billion for bonuses over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the onset of the financial crisis, the strong premiums of the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
On Wednesday, Britain announced that it intends to allocate a one-time tax of fifty percent on bankers' bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics
It is five women, a record number, who today received in Stockholm the Nobel Prizes in technical and literature disciplines from King Charles XVI Gustave of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in chromosomes.
The chemistry prize was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last laureate received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of fiber optics and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each recipient received the Nobel diploma, the Nobel Medal and the Certificate of Acquisition of the pecuniary award.
It reaches 10 million Swedish kroner in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euro)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the award among themselves.
The highly awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the controversial nature of his reward, since he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the expense of his policy he added that in some situations war is indispensable for achieving peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the finance minister Eduard Janota, who weighs his stay in the government due to his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda for their Friday meeting.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further deepens the crisis in public finances.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget which will be subject to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion kroons that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, on Wednesday the Chamber of Deputies approved the proposals of the left on the transfer of money and increased the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the Social Democrats' proposals for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, which calls into question the future of Fischer's cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the SDO, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by MEPs, removes the savings package passed by Fischer's government, which, in his view, must contain the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but is not obliged to do so, said today at a breakfast meeting with entrepreneurs that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irrefinable deficit" of public finances.
Now, in his view, there is no favorable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if it could build on a consensus of the wider political parties, according to the president.
The president of the ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is frightening and that the government should question its future existence.
SDO Vice-President Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, the SDO and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "dramatic verdicts".
The leader of the ČSSD Ji
On Wednesday already, the ČSSD called the ratification of the state budget for the next year a success.
The People's Party was also pleased.
Morgan Freeman to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood Invictus - Undefeated film will expose to the world many things about the country, its fighting and its victories.
History speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an Oscar-winning American actor, plays the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said, it was an ninety-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him, "If I have to play you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who has been awarded a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's Milion Dollar Baby drama in the middle of boxing has, for example, incarnated the leader of a movement against slavery that has become a slave himself, a fictional US president, or even God in the movie Evan Almighty but never someone still alive and as important for so many people as Mandela is.
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work for the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country still remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually advance to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story to the big screen.
I had no other goal but to play this role in such a way as to bring it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I get your energy back, it is transmitted and I felt like I know how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the rough middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I rang at the door of the house, it opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the leadership of Eastwood has received positive opinions and we even talk about ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety summed up his appreciation in the words: "It's a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on rottentomates.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive ratings.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the Bulava missile, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually became the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she damaged herself in full flight.
Russian newspapers talk about "Bulava" as a "missile that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test was normally conducted at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was damage to the aircraft again.
It was obviously the third-stage engine of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew away from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can just be set on fire from a moving boat and submerged
This is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably caused by a defective "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket resisted and the damage touched only the third.
In the previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first stage.
Although none of the test launches occurred without a hitch, the Department of Defense's management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and they therefore always claim that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will carry even ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at age 51
Legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will be back in a professional game at age 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will help his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make its debut in Friday's game against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury we urgently need another defenseman.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details about the form, says coach of the club Sergey Nyemchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It was not specified whether the legendary hockey player's comeback would concern only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford and got 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five-year-old Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
In the colours of the Soviet Union he won gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven world champion titles, and triumphed at the Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also received tributes in NHL, where he held the Stanley Cup twice.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai listened to the unions and canceled all overtime
The management of the Hyundai factory in Nošovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk of Hyundai factory confirmed this.
However, management still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday worked this year again.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why volunteer overtime was offered on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The website Sedmička.cz indicated that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech kroner to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be awarded posteriori for the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can take a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their holiday year-end indicated Vaněk.
In addition to this all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and demands of the unions as employees who spontaneously ceased production last week, management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, employees at the car factory were forced to work almost daily two extra hours in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the strike after the agreement has been signed.
The next negotiation between the management of the car factory and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the state of strike if they agreed on their demands and signed a common document.
The situation in the factory peaked last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of incessant overtime.
They also protested against the poor conditions of wages and so-called hazing.
The management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work additionally to meet the requirements of automobile production.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the trade unions also asked that workers who had ceased production should not be subject to any sanctions.
The unions ask the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a compensation of 5,000 crowns (approximately €209) for these.
The Hyundai car factory in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
She started serial production last year in November.
It manufactured about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "endurant" HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also affects viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality takes precedence, in some cases, over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on common variants of the virus as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
However, the lives of the sick can be radically prolonged through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their use leads to a series of side effects.
Moreover, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of developing so-called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of the experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are an assemblage of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of the researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bonds on the proteins of the virus.
The metalocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by the boron, hydrogen, and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease, mature infectious particles of the virus would not be born.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic link, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases was tested in test pieces as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical drugs, but it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations that need to be explored further to move towards the development of effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína .ez.ová, Director of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The SDO is attacking Fischer, who defends himself.
The president of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek, described the budget ratified for the following year as "fearing", and he said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the SDO's words a drastic verdict.
He says he's taking time to analyze.
SDO spokesman Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, the SDO and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether to take part in the Chamber of Deputies in support of the minority concerned with combating the growing deficit, or whether to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the SDO and the Social Democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
On Wednesday, the Chamber of Deputies ratified the budget for 2010, with proposals for amendments amounting to 12 billion kroons included by the left.
The House increased money for civil servants' salaries, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's complaint about the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of NOK 163 billion.
The SDO left the room before the vote, thus complying with the government's wish that an amended budget is a less bad alternative than an interim budget.
Deception and inutility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of pointlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment Monday with the Prime Minister after his visit to the government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering whether he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who have imposed the changes in the budget, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws that increase the deficit, such as those that affect health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the SDO are not involved.
This is the case of the Head of Government Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the SDO did nothing harmful, Topolánek pointed out in a textual statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some departments claimed TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the level of the public finances deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
Having said that, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the democrats.
I didn't think about it and once it's on the agenda, I'll focus on it," said Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected to the government by the Democrats from the House.
Prime Minister Fischer took off in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The SDO reversed at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the SDO would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not explicitly asked the democrats to allow the budget to be voted on.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not small children, did he react to the question of whether the SDO had not been criticized by the president of the Party in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew at the time I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a Bolshevisation of the House and a destruction of all that was positive, Topolánek replied in person.
According to the new schedules of the ČD there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will abolish or limit certain less loaded express or regional trains from 13 December and will reinforce some others.
Total transport coverage will decrease on the day of entry into force of the new timetables by two percent compared to today.
Most rates will not change, including basic and reduced rates.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the Prague - Letohrad direct line will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the Hradec Králové region by a total of eight percent, while Prague and its surroundings can be pleased with an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and some express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only a few days a week.
Among the greatest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change at Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at the Prague Main Station (Praha Hlavní nádra+).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart in two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
This year's bill for the regional railways is an additional Kroner 200 million.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Railways next year a total of four billion kroons to pay for the visible losses, which is the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions which will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate in almost three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
Railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they did not use a price increase for the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will only affect ČD Net day tickets and eLiška discounted internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroons.
The price of eLiška will newly depend on the journey travelled, whereas until then it was valid between cities of a region of choice and was at a single rate of 160 kroons.
Filipino rebels are still holding more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels today abducted 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed it, but that spoke of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that approximately 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields during a police escape.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the military wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police initially prosecuted the kidnappers following violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the elections of the governor's administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the South Philippines was arrested following suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
South Africa's history is about everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in American theaters in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was awarded to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theatres, feedback from critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
With his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Mind, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes since it is presented at a time when on the one hand South Africa is in full preparation for the football World Cup, and on the other hand because the media are agitated by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations expressed towards the main roles where "pavante" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is, however, proud of the film by taking his own words.
I dreamed of this role for many years and I prepared myself well.
I have also met with Nelson Mandela many times personally in order to be able - as they say - to recover from his energy, he said during the official premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember Mandela's personality and message through the film.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual added.
Wearing the national rugby team jersey
The film based on the story of the novel by the British writer John Carlin is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave its creation to the people portrays the South African human rights defender during his term as president.
Morgan Freeman tries during the film to put together two racial groups of a long-divided population and Nelson Mandela in 1995 he enters in the South African team's national jersey on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won at the time.
For showing up on the lawn in jersey, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been long ovationated fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by the white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in uniting people again into a single nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
South African whites are skeptical, however, as recently stated in an interview with LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of wreaths in flames in the region of Louny
In the morning a fire swallowed up a transformer of the company Čeps from the distribution center near the commune of V+kov na Lounsku.
According to Ústí Fire Department spokesman Luk+ Marvan, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer consume, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the spokesman of the company Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe functioning of the transmission set.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
She added that in ten years of activity Čeps had not experienced anything similar and that incidents of this type were isolated.
Electricity supplies have not been interrupted, says the ČEZ spokesman for the Northern Bohemian So+a Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire at the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in Czech territory of 400 kV and 220 kV transmission systems and power lines.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transmission units to distribution units and lines of 4339 kilometres in length.
Jančura to file defamation suit against three ČSSD prefects
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will file today a defamation complaint against three Social Democrat Prefects.
And concretely against Michal Hašek of the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesa
Jančura indicated it in Radiožurnál's Dvacet minut.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions concluded long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of us attacked us and claim that we're doing the fine mouths, while we've only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
It's in exchange for slanders about Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he indicated that he had evidence that no region had proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr Jančura's complaint is the continuation of his media show which serves as a free publicity for his company and for his person.
I am of course willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and false arguments about regional rail transport, Hašek says.
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable steps taken by the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he will interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he intends to resume it after the New Year.
He clarified that the campaign will focus on corruption in a broad sense.
Jančura started its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of the railway links for an order of about SEK 150 billion, without issuing a tender.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to threats from a member of the ČSSD in Jančura.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licences.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is, but I won't say his name," Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices, saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for August children.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal disease.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination started last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Already last year a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
Yet parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for one dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that every year health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 kroons in doses of vaccine.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
Up to now, the State has spent about 500,000 kroons per year on all immunization of children.
Refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcals cause inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital investigations, there are up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age due to pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the immunisation reimbursed.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible obligation to vaccinate in the future.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský said that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose this at least.
I think this is a direction that must now be followed, Kalovský said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We do not envisage it at all at the moment, said its spokesman Vlastimil Srše+.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Paediatric Society, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, one could consider a decrease in vaccination renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional," says Cabrnochová.
Specialists predict that as of next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also a break because it is the first vaccination of children that is financed by insurance and not the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should free up funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
However, this is linked to the concerns of paediatricians who are practitioners, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance companies, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other government-provided vaccine products.
However, some MEPs feared that this would allow insurance to "deduct the sums from health insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to reimburse them.
It is estimated that paediatricians will need to individually invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Flight"
Frank Frazetta's son, a well-known illustrator, was accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr.Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the museum into the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr.Frazetta Senior, aged 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press (AP).
AP cited a police official who said that the young Mr.Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, said 52-year-old Mr.Frazetta Jr. claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denies having given such authorization, said the agency.
Labour defends the increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the tax increase and expenditure reductions announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticisms from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by deferring his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted lightning by attacking low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, we can see an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public wages from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
The trade unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession for which they are not responsible and warned that "problems" were looming.
The reduction in social insurance - which will raise around GBP 3 billion a year - has made the world of companies angry, because he believes it is a tax on jobs while the objective should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than GBP 20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PRINCIPAL ISSUES OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social insurance will increase further by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
The increase in corporate income tax for small corporations has been abandoned.
Tax rebates for electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning GBP 30,000 will lose GBP 90 per year and a person earning GBP 40,000 will lose GBP 190, while a person earning GBP 10,000 per year will earn GBP 110 more.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 led to "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would weigh on the first 5 % of employees.
Stephen Timms, Secretary of the Treasury, refuted an increase in the tax and pointed out that a decrease in spending was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, and they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely indispensable over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said that he was confident and that economic growth would restart at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts of economic growth - which will influence the amount it will have to borrow and the speed with which the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - far worse than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April - while the borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Missed opportunity"
The Conservatives who will launch a new publicity campaign this Thursday warning against the "debt crisis" of Labour, said that the plan to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, "cynically" eluded difficult choices until after the elections - which are due to be held in June 2010.
"They presented nothing significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Treasury Secretary of the Ghost Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
"The important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, contrary to Tory's proposals that would lead to a faster and larger reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised through higher taxes and lower spending would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "wind-built".
Nick Robinson, BBC political editor, said the schedule of announcements - such as the increase in inflation for some disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor facing propaganda accusations, with money simply being recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is being provided when people need it most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Fake budget"
Although ministers did not publish spending details beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that public spending restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Etudes Fiscales) has stated that the Chancellor's figures imply substantial reductions in many areas in the future, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only postponed," said its Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report, and markets are well aware of it."
FBI investigating "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in eastern Punjab province, announced the US Embassy in Pakistan, at the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether it was the same men who had been reported missing from their homes in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are detained," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, FBI spokesman, said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing," she said.
The Pakistan Embassy in Washington claimed that the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
She said that the house was already under the supervision of the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters news agency, but she said the United States should "cooperate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students had been reported missing from their homes by their families in North Virginia by the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuse"
In the last 20 years, human rights have been as poorly respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
the report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the presidential election campaign in June.
A man named in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another stated that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its failure to respect human rights.
The authorities have stated that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the biggest public demonstrations since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"Fass confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook networks' and protesting against the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, in front of my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still in blood and half conscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the losing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who claimed to have been locked up in a container with 75 other persons, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary should set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response, but said that the mandate and powers of these bodies were not clear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested over the past three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the park of the city
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to transform the Bristol site into a competition track.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowborders competing for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park trail, a small springboard preceded a 100m long trail.
John Hickman, a fourth year medical student, said that the view from the top of the track was beautiful but that it was quite intimidating.
It is a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city shimmering below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowborders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prizes have been awarded for the best flickers - or figures made on the runway.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be abandoned to melt.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted to this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French don't like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and worried the country for fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Bowen's latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious framework.
A good anthropologist, he does not just want to know what politicians and media are saying about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country now.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He is very good at listening to and reproducing the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to obtain a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that are of concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't push the debate to the end.
The Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their fellow lawyers of a Sunni Purist Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who today make up a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wonders how much the French politicians (and the intellectual elite so virulent of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a "closeness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the far north, the polar bear.
Knowing the history and complicated policies of whaling, he described the long tradition of Arctic explorers who demonstrated themselves by hunting the polar bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson, then a courageous 14-year-old aspiring man who was only fighting for the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, captured as they were swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous spectacle brought together 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the size of a zoo is usually one millionth of the surface required for an adult in freedom.The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green because of the algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often discusses the threat hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two nations of hunting that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating insight into what the future may be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither amospherists nor oceanographers can accurately relate the speed of change.
It's not a mistake to try.
At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering voyages gave the first information on the melting of the ice cap.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the subsurface relief changes.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but the bulk of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the arctic ice-dependent system, formed by brackish water fillets pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it'll be our turn."
Marines, of the 6,000 people who laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington
First class De'Angello Robinson, 19, made a seven-hour bus trip to lay a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I'd like someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on veterans' graves in various sections of the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honour of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the site of the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, stated that she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who sacrificed themselves.
This is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Embedded in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extensive hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as from the Vietnam War, as these are not as often visited as the new graves, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as the children played and the couples stood by the hand, carrying the crowns of fresh pine on the grey graves.
Each round crown had a dark green colour, with a small red bow tie on the top.
Close by, there was silence over Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan were buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals were crying without hiding, others were praying, and families and friends were supporting themselves in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others leaned to see the small black and white information maps, embedded in the wet ground for those whose graves had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many weeping mothers at her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and had taken eight hours to come and relax at the grave of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget how free we are... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American national arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested a United States national who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, said the services of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific accusations have not been made public, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, lead to the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, popular commentator who often writes about how husbands are and is being followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive awards but permissions have always been denied.
The detention of an American national may increase tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which pursues a "soft" approach in order to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new American policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country where an official's average salary is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for text messages or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day's salary.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors to the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to sign in must communicate their names to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that would be allowed in any other open society -- free distribution of mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas programme of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his sick older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, as both countries began to engage in a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities spotted an organization supposed to be preparing a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this case would disassemble a large network of terrorist recruiters who roam the Internet in search of young radicalized men.
The investigators claimed that they hunted a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video website on the Internet.
When they arrived in Pakistan, they were guided by Saifullah, who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani secret service representative who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north-east, which have become a refuge for terrorism.
They were considered to be undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition that they remain anonymous because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary permits to enter the al-Qa'idah camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps more importantly, in the determination of those who can trust them.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the priority of the United States intelligence services has been to infiltrate men into the al-Qa'idah network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of barrier guards, refusing entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propagandal value.
However Evan Kohlmann, expert of the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups must also pay more and more attention, in recent years in the choice of people they accept because the American secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model that so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen call for "action" for climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked the streets here on Saturday, demanding more action on the climate from negotiators working in the city's Bella Convention Center Convention Center.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but estimated by the police at 25,000.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On this day when little happened during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city, deploying signs in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish saying 'The Earth says it has had enough'.
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travelling to her mother's home country, Peru, has opened her eyes to the heartbreaking problems facing the country because of the impact of climate change that is already happening."
That's one of the reasons why I decided to join in the great march -- to get the word across and to appeal to leaders around the world to make decisions that are fair, ambitious and committed, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella centre and said that they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella centre and said that they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in the climate discussions, activists who wore black masks and clothing, lit several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around TV screens to follow the march throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the demonstrators have failed to awaken the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's climate representative.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "In fact, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful depending on the outlook.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal persistent differences between races.
Last week's federal report on mathematics results brought good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the top schools, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) have made much greater progress over the past two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between the performance of African Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in Washington, D.C. have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) is generally constant, falling from only one point, from 245 to 244.
The mean white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overall view over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1) class, when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262-22).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by group director Michelle A. Rhee and mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean that we raised the aggregate by looking at the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality in district education.
I don't jump for one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (a Democrat relative), a member of the D.C. Board and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said the message of test results is that the city's middle schools (college) desperately need attention.
Really, you still want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what is scary is that we do not devote enough time and energy to our middle schools (college).
Rhee stated that the District needed to continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at pupils in the final grades of elementary and early secondary school who did not integrate the basics of reading earlier in their schooling and who are quite late compared to their peers.
Every day, the mathematics program, for Kindergarten (Maternal) classes in Grade 6 (6th) focuses on games and real life experiences, as they were set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply think that we need to continue working to offer better interventions to these students at a lower level than that of the class, Rhee said.
Others felt that the NEAP results raised the question of whether Rhee could continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing less money and resources for schools in order to narrow the gap.
It's a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education trainer at the University of Berkeley, California, who is studying city test results.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in Washington's poorest neighbourhoods.
Also, targeting can have political implications that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other school superintendents, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We are focused on developing a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they come from, are assured that their children will be able to obtain an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to narrow the gap was the length of the traditional public school, now 180 days in Washington District, to compete with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of his teachers last year to get 185 days, that he considers a "start point" to get another increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise of the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descends and blinks for a moment at the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents were only able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 students (4th) of the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of an impressed new student than enthusiastic.
Super That's where I'm going to study! Graciela exclaimed that she would like to study medicine, as the guide directed them to the entrance to the science building.
"Youpi, really?" she said, thinking, when she was told the low ratio of law professor to student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you are going to university:
The question is where.
Although this question still largely arises for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents in adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one Hispanic of the "second generation" out of five pursues high school education -- a notable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, researchers say, they pave the way for future generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study the batons claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many parents also set high goals for their children and found ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, won't help them," said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about offering a support network to these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepare yourself), it provides over $300 million per year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the programme has been attended by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent entering university, according to the US Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry secures agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract large oil companies to rebuild its troubled infrastructure during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
The US companies left with a stake in only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one who put on an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies obtained contracts for the auctioned fields in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are opening the way," said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an information website on the Internet.
It will take a long time for another offer to be made in Iraq.
Concerns about security, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as US military troops retreated have held back US oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, analysts say.
American companies were, in some cases, at a disadvantage because of their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important United States companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided technical advice, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the State, has bid more on contracts than other companies and has gone with significant stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be equal to its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The pre-selected auction companies made offers that were then compared to the per barrel rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the main al-Qa'idah organizers was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that an American missile, having struck along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, declared on Friday that the US authorities were counterintelligence.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles thrown into their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah, North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA inside Pakistan's anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of the Pakistani Civil Secret Service, speaking on Miran Shah's phone.
The authorities' representatives said that the local activists suspected rushed into the area and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally shredded bodies".
It was totally impossible for the local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two US anti-terrorist representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as one of the al-Qaida military organizers who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic guidelines of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the United States stated that Somali had made rapid progress in the ranks of al-Qaida's and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the American general public, but that does not diminish the threat he poses to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major al-Qa'idah character or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of CIA drone attacks has declined since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures from the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, says the site.
United Nations Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
UN Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate tainted by allegations of corruption extended during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
Eide's departure came when the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States' timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community," Eide said in a telephone interview with Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he was not resigning but would simply honour his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives said that Staffan di Mistura had been mentioned; he was a citizen of Italo-Switzerland who had recently chaired a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who had previously led United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of promoting President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but stated that Galbraith's accusations -- which was thanked -- "were detrimental to the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism about international election observation."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of United States forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration about the limitations of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy United Nations hiring regulations were hindering its ability to bring new talent.
The United Nations rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran needs additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the world's major powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a bed of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week-long visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has defied the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a outcome. ̈
One of the things that weighs most on me is that if I have learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable aspect inherent in war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He said that a "set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be in less security with nuclear weapons" because "his people would suffer enormously" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme back in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experience solely for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear programme and agree to abandon a significant portion of his stockpiling of enriched uranium in exchange for the desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a way to build confidence on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have moved away from attempts at agreement - in part, say the experts, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, Iran's stiffening in the face of some of the international community's proposals for which they had in fact agreed in early October, prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join on what they had not envisaged, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set 31 December as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turned to other options, including the pursuit of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement made on Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "unsubstantiated allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and affirmed its agreement to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the rich oil region of Kurdish to meet the Troop Leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly regarding borders, property rights and income-sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in US plans to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the Kurds' anxiety about the pending withdrawal. The US authorities quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan regional government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you."
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters sermonizing them, "Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An extra baby is an extra grave".
They have learned so well that the Shanghai Government authorities, alarmed by the low birth rate in their city and by the ageing population, have radically changed direction this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction has been instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We don't have a second left," said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources, who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the only child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good cheeks and spoils, nicknamed "small emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from six to 1.8 children per couple when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the registered resident population in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, stated that fertile couples must have babies in order "to help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a lack of labour in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive mitigation
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is, without a doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who break this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and face discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have given the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women with a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys to girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Beijing University, said that the central government authorities recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of retail regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and slip flyers under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the Family Planning Officer, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city in the suburbs of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records from couples wishing to have a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly above 2009 but below 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly regard the one child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the first child of the couple.
It's true, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Officer, said she wanted only one child because she was one herself. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone take care of us."
We don't usually take care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company says it more seriously.
For couples working for two, middle class, who lower the birth rate, he says, one must be selfish if one is to succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 grew up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and do not want to have that lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even one child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his resume to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations group has draft emission reduction plans
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- so far characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- has returned to the spotlight on Friday, as a result of the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the coming time.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as it informed the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the time-consuming negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a UN ad hoc working group, the text does not say how rich countries would give to the poor to withstand global warming, both in the short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that leaders would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN Executive Secretary-General on climate change, Yvo de Boer, described as "the full picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, by 25 to 45 per cent from 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, over the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched the negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
On Friday, however, the same verbal altercations took place, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, US Climate Negotiator, rejected any discussion that forced the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared to the voluntary efforts of the major emerging economies, if not funded by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the main developing countries, says Stern, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern commented an hour after China's Deputy Foreign Minister, He Yafei, said that the US chief negotiator, either lacked "good sense" or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the US would not help China financially to fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States arguing about their respective obligations, while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives of acting more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting to find out who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which is developed a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries that are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say that negotiations will lead at least to a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the Climate Unit of the European Commission, said that the action of small island states "has put political pressure on the entire political process", partly because they are now unified and they are asking emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The discussions became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the outstanding issues before Heads of Government reached agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Minister of the Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister descended from their aircraft and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend closed meetings and information conferences in order to be able to make complaints that will be studied during the following week.
The real image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Congress Hall every day -- guitar player activists present night shows mocking countries that they believe are betraying and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the greats' courts, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy at Conservation International.
The heavy goods vehicles are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. Monday morning, a whistle will break through at night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed commuter train will reach 225 km/h, while it will travel from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first commuter train Javelin outside London.
He hoped that the new service would enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and would link the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The small holes lost will become flourishing suburban cities, the length of business travel will be much shorter and the passage of the aircraft and car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and the fears of environmental dangers risk blocking British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line from London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where environmental impact may be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final itinerary.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a larger, northward high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another heading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option" said a rail professional.
When this is over, travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400 km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Experts in the rail industry state that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be required to operate off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, maintaining journey times between London and Scotland of more than three hours.
This seems to be the best solution to ensure a switch from aircraft to trains, which is a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay GBP 75,000 loan for Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the main member of Tory's parliament, had the taxpayer pay thousands of pounds a year to pay back the cost of an orangery he built in his home in his riding.
The leader of the party who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were "sustained", increased his loan by GBP 75,000 to build an oak extension to his second house in Rutland.
He had been authorized to charge the taxpayer for the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month.
The authorities of the Commons received the complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carries out a check on members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan stated that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The surrounding houses were sold for nearly £1 million.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe her as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee into his pre-borrowing arrangements.
The Committee cleared him last month of any charges of non-compliance, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of borrowing GBP 271.406 from his London property at his constituency house, which he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan was claiming around GBP 1,400 per month of interest on loans until March last year.
In April, its requests increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the GBP 75,000 loan.
The RBS variable standard interest rate rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, unchanged since then.
The latest publication by the authorities of the Commons shows that Mr Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Duncan lost his position as Head of the Ghost Cabinet in September, after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed him saying that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated as "de la m...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and I asked for a small part, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for more, but I didn't."
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil trader, began to have to explain his expenses in May, after it appeared that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the expense bureau that it "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a £-shaped hole in Duncan's lawn, protesting after it was revealed that he had applied for GBP 4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for major improvements, approved both by the fee bureau and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem with evading or developing or using rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn't be clearer or simpler."
Faithful, come and see the calendar of Brighton Advent
Brighton beach cabins have found a new promotion way for the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabins for each December day, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., each day, with free hot wine and pies.
The Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the booth presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest from the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should get closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
"The idea of the Advent calendar of the beach cabin came right after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent it through spirituality."
Strong climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of people protested Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to the police, some 100 thousand according to the organisers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the UN Climate Conference, which will reach an agreement by Friday that can enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization on climate around the world, illustrated by these events, helped to make "the political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the procession left, when a group of 300 demonstrators, entirely dressed in black, broke windows with cobblestones and hammers, observed a journalist from AFP.
Anti-riot police immediately intervened indiscriminately.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to them members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that had notably illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organisers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", stressing that about a hundred of them "were still held in the street on Saturday night "stuck and held in a sitting position despite the extreme cold".
Parliamentary party, the procession, rather good child, took over the Bella Center, site of the negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building, without seeking to enter it.
A stage had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators had come by bus and by train from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are going down the streets to demand compensation for the environmental debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, rivers where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen for "the link between climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, wearing bandanas boasting of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, rallies of a few hundred demonstrators have also been held to demand vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the events organised by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow recognised this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounced a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5:00 GMT.
The turnout was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the outgoing President Sergey Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheyl Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it to be part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which claimed several thousand lives, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, told the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with some palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential in this region with magnificent landscapes, on the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are installed throughout this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the western part of the country, district head Beslan Archba gave a warm welcome to Russian officials who came to monitor the electoral process.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations," said Alexey Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as the one giving Russia control over the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, said he did not support the current power or the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: protests around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the alert, arrested nearly 700 people on the margins of a massive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, about one hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts until 18 December delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement that will enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliamentary party, the procession, generally a good child, took over the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the centre, without seeking to enter.
A stage had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the procession left, a group of a few hundred demonstrators, entirely dressed in black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, observed a journalist from the AFP.
Anti-riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened indiscriminately, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that had notably illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a cobblestone and four cars set on fire near a squat during incidents that led to the arrest of some 20 people, according to the police.
We look at extremist groups, had warned the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the security forces were turning in the sky.
The majority of the demonstrators, who came by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are going down the streets to demand compensation for the environmental debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, there are streams where you can walk when you've never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, told the AFP that he had come to Copenhagen for "the link between climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who was to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas boasting solar energy in front of the Philippine capital city hall.

The history-geo emerges strengthened from the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel stated in an interview to be published in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were "reinforced" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in science terminal.
From now on, first class students will all have four hours a week and the same program for a shared shared culture, says Chatel.
For the minister, "we have to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "S is no longer a scientific stream" but "in essence, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L channels cannot remain sub-filières of the S, he continues, stressing again: "I have also not heard many historians and intellectuals indignant at the absence of the history-geography in the finale in the technological high schools".
Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten (69%) French people were disapproving of the government's plan to abolish the compulsory teaching of terminal history-geography S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some right-wing elected officials.
On the other hand, the Minister added that there was "no way" to remove the philosophy of the senior S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization Tuesday to protest against the project, which according to them sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will focus on their discipline, then at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also follow internships in the M2 year and then be a first year in front of students as trainee teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister said that he would propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the plan to delete the school map "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince on the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the stakes of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure de la rue d'Ulm, met on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a series of interventions by experts, of fifteen minutes each, filmed and open to the public, noted a journalist of the AFP.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the sidelines of the Edouard Hannezo conference, 22, one of the organizers of this day that takes its name from the one given by the students to the fish of the school basin.
Some 20 stakeholders were selected from among the experts in their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
On global warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes", told AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes, but with the help of graphs, in front of about fifty people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the listeners will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
The videos from these lectures will be posted on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly rate.
Late payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
Unions of prison guards called Friday for the "general movement" to demand payment by the end of the year of bonuses and overtime, the payment of which was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd supervisory union) asked staff who will not be on duty to protest Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "lock them", to "declare the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd trade union) calls them to "meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", considering "honest and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtime, night, Sunday and public holidays" worked in October.
And the first supervisory union, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and was not all budgeted, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
The Chancery indicated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the supervisory unions guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I have asked the management of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation, which arose from a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours, does not happen again in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The pay of December will therefore be meagre, except for the management staff benefiting from the famous bonuses of functions and objectives, lamented the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budget constraints have good back".
It is a pure scandal, outraged the interregional union FO of Marseilles, announcing its decision to boycott until further order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and public holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, idem for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff money, believes the CGT-penitentiaire of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less well off than others.
But anyway the account is not there, noted Ufap General Secretary Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he's offering "niceer things" than the ones he receives.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, told the "paper" of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple gift rule: "I give things nicer than the ones I get."
As part of a special show to be broadcast on Sunday night on ABC channel, President and his wife Michelle offer a glimpse of how they intend to celebrate the end of the year celebrations in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be part of it.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would have "of course" a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama went against her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he receives: "Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year," she teased the president.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before replying with humor by pointing at the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you this?".
During this one-hour show, in a relaxed atmosphere, with the famous host who was a strong supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favourite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember that time when I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and gave me a basketball, said the president.
It was not until much later in my life that I realized that it was he who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperative, RTL says he's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operatived in Los Angeles due to significant "leavings" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operatived on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors had found "lesions resulting from the operation" of the disc herniated in Paris on November 26, said in Paris his press service, stating that these injuries had "necessary a restorative operation".
The singer's press service, however, wanted to reassure itself that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was however plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pains and complications".
It's only in 48 hours that we'll have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens an eye, adds RTL.
When asked by the AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to certain sources" no drain would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for this herniated disc.
The surgery, scheduled for several days, had been performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux , a doctor very well known in the artistic milieu.
This one was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL's information.
Following his surgery on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a relative of Johnny Hallyday, estimated Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but assured himself "no worries" for the rocker, who is "a fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because doing twelve hours of flying after such an operation is not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure himself, claiming that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "endowed".
Mr. Camus also said he spoke with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and did not notice any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated on by a "little colon cancer" and then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed the singer's difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: Bousquet’s first on its fetish distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medallist at the 2009 World Championships in Great Basin, won an international title on Thursday over a distance he particularly likes, the 50 m freestyle, during the Euro-2009 in Small Basin in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition, when suits were last allowed, saw only three world records beaten while waiting for a surge.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relay gentlemen 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, who languished on the world record of the 50 m free, of which he holds the mark in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50 m free, it was the 28-year-old Frenchman who won in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet was ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world brand (20.30) as he had envisaged.
One can always dream better and in this case, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1.
At the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finished their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of combinations was not used this time by the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in large basin this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer did not manage to lower the mark he holds over 400 m freestyle (3:32.77) but nevertheless won by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself up on this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: Sarcophagus panel owned by Zola awarded US$1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging in particular to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded on Thursday 1.5 million dollars, well above its estimate, announced the art merchant Sotheby's.
This front panel, two meters long by 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four dionysiac scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world", explained to the AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice-president of the Roman and Egyptian antique art auctions at Sotheby's.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have bid the most so far, told the AFP a spokesperson for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively to the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bathtub in his Parisian private mansion, and to Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
Remained a shadow zone of about fifty years.
While searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola Succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart".
Attempted aborted departure from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico considered that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the fallen President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied a safe conduct by the putschist government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not combined, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived on Wednesday in El Salvador to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government plane left to its place of origin, according to a source of the Directorate General of Migrations.
The putschist government wanted to force Mr Zelaya to "dismisse" and seek political asylum abroad to grant him a safe driving.
But the fallen president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as guest head of state.
The putschist government "has experienced another failure in wanting me to give up my office (...), they wanted me to resign", said Thursday Mr Zelaya on Radio Globo, on which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has been going on for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some chords the fallen president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, said on Wednesday the minister of the interior of the putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, on Honduran radio HRN.
I am not seeking asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to take place as President of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumours of departure of Mr Zelaya had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the fallen president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military strengthened their headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the putschist government's position.
This demonstrates the marginality of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan socialist president Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, the day he had organized a popular consultation to prepare his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he had returned by surprise on 21 September and had taken refuge at the Brazilian Embassy.
If he comes out, he will be arrested for the crime of "high treason" accused of justice, according to the putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected in the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Mr Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with US trade balance figures reflecting the recovery in both the US and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced by 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, with a technological dominance, by 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index awarded 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she tempered, believing that the market was focused on "half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on US trade balance figures, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The US trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October compared to September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected a widening deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States increased against all expectations last week, reaching 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest level in a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market's down.
The yield of the 10-year-old treasury bill increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% on Tuesday evening and the yield of the 30-year-old bond to 4.492% compared to 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of power consummate the "Ladies in White" · Global Voices
On Thursday, a few hundred supporters of the Cuban government conspired with the wives of political detainees gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which about ten dissidents were arrested.
Some 40 "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were consummated in the middle of the street by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they were marching towards the centre of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, noted a journalist from the AFP.
Down with the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Vive Fidel and Raul!" chanted, with a raised fist, the supporters of power to dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes agents who came "to ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havanese neighbourhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for International Human Rights Day were arrested by plainclothes policemen, a journalist of the AFP observed.
The police forceed into civilian vehicles the dissidents who were congested by government supporters, according to the journalist.
Interpellations of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain in lock-up.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" in the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of flouting rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression.
Forced kills an octagenary with a knife and injured 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
A forceed man armed with two knives killed an octagenary and wounded five other people in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hautes-de-Seine), at one hour of traffic, on Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant was allegedly beaten with two knives and for unknown reasons, an octagenary, in or in front of a pharmacy on 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, was learned from police sources and witnesses.
Grievingly wounded, the old man, born in 1929, according to an official of the Alliance police union, died in hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, about thirty years old, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenary died.
The other injured person's days are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became ill and was reportedly hospitalized "in shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He reportedly injured two passers-by, apparently at random: a thirty-year-old and a four-year-old, the latter seriously.
The script remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he wore in cross behind his back, explained on site an official of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies collected by the AFP, have tried to master the forceful.
I saw a guy about thirty years old with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was tough, said Alberto, waiter of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Always boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of n°61, two municipal police officers, including their official, tried to challenge the armed man and were wounded with fists, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Some passers-by came to tell me there was a person injured outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put her in a safe position, and I saw a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, was wounded with a knife.
It was the National Police that arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office referred the investigation to the Hauts-de-Seine Department of Judicial Police (SDPJ 92).
Forced man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in custody.
A police source did not rule out that he was interned in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six policemen to control him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" like "all the forceless of this species whose forces multiply under the effect of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the prosecution to be dropped
Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski's lawyer again demanded Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the abandonment of the prosecution against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a matter of more than 30 years old.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", denounced before three judges of the Court of Appeal of the second district of California serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
I demand that the charges be dropped here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "were cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who had since died -- had discussed, before issuing his sentence, with a prosecutor who had told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which was a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "mented" the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to drop the prosecution, Mr. Hummel requested a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before sentencing, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old girl.
He's never set foot in the United States since.
The Los Angeles County Deputy Prosecutor, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "must be there to appear at the hearing."
In this case, would the message be sent not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape?, Ms. Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "requests a favor from the court, while disregarding his authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also pointed out "that there were other alternatives to the flight."
Mr. Hummel wasn't the only one asking for the prosecution of Roman Polanski to be dropped.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also called once again for an end to the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being harassed at every turn of the Polanski affair, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends up undirected, curbed by the rise in the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended up undirected on Friday, in a market truncated between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, noted Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think that will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which "helped to improve market opinion on the soundness of the economic recovery", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence rebounded sharply in December, at 73.4 compared to 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were held back by a further rise in the dollar, at the highest level in the last two months against the euro, which "pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market's down.
The yield of the 10-year-old treasury bill increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday evening and the yield of the 30-year-old bond to 4.497% compared to 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of travelling through South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are preparing to cross Saturday's last straight line to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this grand mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sports or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a veritable whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was amazing.
I've seen so many things and had so many experiences!, exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5:00 pm (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have experienced it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery "of breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Misses now focus on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and who was present at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
It's every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launches Miss India with a large smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costume and of course in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by a TV presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and an official of the Miss World Committee Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to match, says Julia Morley, President of Miss World.
The candidates as last year made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Not common for a head of state, says Miss Sierra Leone.
Their greatest memory will undoubtedly remain the draw in Cape Town (south-west) for the World Cup of football in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been with people I never thought I could get near.
I will undoubtedly come back for the 2010 World Cup, is enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive", according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive", assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport where he had to go to his father's bedside hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it's going very well," said David Hallyday to the press when he left the plane that took him from Paris shortly after 13.00pm local (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured that he would go "very quickly" to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma last night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a disc hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be rehearsed during the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went on Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade was educated to attend a school show, a photographer from AFP observed.
The head of orthopaedic and trauma surgery at the Hospital de la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catone, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer violently challenged Dr Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, said Mr. Camus.
I've heard of a possible judicial procedure to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus felt that Johnny Hallyday was "going far too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem with this trip and it was astounding to me, since I myself had two hernia discs, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "goed without drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the arts.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practising at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resolve a haematoma following cerebral haemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, condemned several times by the courts, in medical liability cases, as well as for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Doctors' Order, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of Order, and who is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was "perfectly successful" and that post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the installation of a drain", he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ed.) as planned, seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The association UDF raises the tone and sums up the New Center to no longer use its acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted Friday to OPA's attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardian party, calling on it to no longer use it on any medium, on pain of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP moved to NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF mark for being the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday evening, the office of the association UDF, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to be dispossessed, came out of its silence to issue a formal notice to the minister and the deputy, urging them no longer to use the acronym and to transmit to them the property of the mark, on pain of prosecution.
In the last few days, you have multiplied the statements indicating that you were going to propose to your political movement to take over+ the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it appropriate to forward on your militant material and on your site's watch page, the name of this movement, the +New Center+, of the slogan +the UDF of today+, also note the signatories of the mail.
As you are aware, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF office, which calls on the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as from (its) website".
He also asked Hervé de Charette "to pass on the ownership of (the) mark to his legitimate successors".
If you did not do so, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "has been a political movement in its own right since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others did in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and to create an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continued, "when he filed the mark", he was no longer "member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
He profited scandalously and fraudulently from the abscence of filing the acronym UDF to perform it on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironing out on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for oneself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled".
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses him, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenary to strip her of part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, an offence punishable by a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear each other apart while holding the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical assessment of Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, should be conducted collegiately by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, at least not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre prosecutor's office during the investigation.
The designated doctors will be required to submit a report by March 10, 2010, stating in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she'll do it.
I'm going to talk to her, said Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman, at the end of the hearing.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will demonstrate that he (Mr.Banier) manipulated this elderly lady whom we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has brought criminal charges against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and a touch-to-all artist, whom she accuses of having taken advantage of her mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt, for her part, has always refuted having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a long-time friend.
While the court had to consider the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers' case, the lawyers' arguments sometimes turned to the big family unpacking on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Can you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her since her wedding."
For her part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office again held that the complainant was not entitled to take action, especially since in recent days a guardianship judge had refused to grant her application for judicial protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in her place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees, recalls the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of making employees adhere to "values" determined from above as it once was, of imposing on consumers products designed by the technicians of the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering the markets in the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from the factors of customer preferences returns regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects managers in particular.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the company's intellectual functions, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that authoritarian management revenue completely contradicts.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put employees at the centre of the company's concerns on the same footing as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys—like the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees—incite this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, every structure finally, after many detours, gets to do first and foremost... what it has always done.
- Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
Coming from the major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, out of intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the American "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "leviers" (sic) of the commitment of executives, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reinforces the leaders in a posture of mechanistic governance, inappropriate to the world of today.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, presupposes adopting a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It consists in integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, commitment for the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to realize part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
At present, only the studies resulting from the Reasoning Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their business on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the business, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and hand over their human resources management "to the place".
They thus create a favourable ground for the concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: "Just War" Worth Right-Walking Praise to Obama
On Friday, the American right welcomed Barack Obama's previous speech in Oslo, who was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who brokered Obama's award on October 9, applauded the presidential speech this time, as did Sarah Palin, former vice-president in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, a geriatric of the right wing of the Republican Party, to the daily US Today, adding that she herself had addressed the topic of war "sometimes necessary" in her memoirs that have just been published.
War is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be stopped all over there, she said.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, welcomed the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some sides, I found this speech quite historic, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected member, considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" remind the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and would not be able to award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former penist of George W. Bush converted columnist at the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does," "he spoke like an American president," reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few on the right to be unconvinced, a Bush-era hawk, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "ternal, ampoule and uninspired" on the National Review Online site.
On the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed by Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When one envelops war in the notion of justice, one can easily justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained laudable to the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Obama, described his speech as "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression" sparked the Californian daily.
Obama "made the right speech," the New York Times said, judging him "both dark and edifying."
Roads: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three sessions of negotiations-marathon, the trade unions in the road sector and TLF, the only employers' organisation to have stayed until the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that puts an end to the slogan of strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday evening, Secretary of State for Transport Dominique Bussereau "rejoiced" this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators had left in the early morning of Friday, hoping to sign the agreement text quickly at the end of the morning.
And even if three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took even more than six hours of a meeting started at 11:00 a.m. for everyone to agree and at 6:00 p.m. the text to be signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to companies" and "it was to be feared that it would disrupt the end-of-year celebrations," said Mr Bussereau.
The text foresees an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low wages, "from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but we're going a long way, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we're going to order our activists that there's no blockages, no blockade of the supply centers.
But we can still have a few recalcitrant people who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed "a good deal", even though it was "difficult to concede increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros monthly for the low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs, and for the general state of road transport to be maintained in the first half of 2010, which will notably address the question of a 13th month and a modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a €100 million reduction in employers' fees" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 amending finance bill, which was voted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "in the same way."
TLF's signature allows the agreement to apply first to companies belonging to this organisation, and second, to the whole profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "as soon as possible", said Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dupe market", as the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate urgently, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the turkey eaters of the next New Year, lamented the Unostra.
For the rest of the world, the agreement is likely "to dig the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disruptions this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disruptions on the RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and RATP management left them on their hunger as to their demand for a bonus.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will only be trains between 10am and 8pm, with one in two trains on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one in four trains outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture, which will force passengers to switch trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which wait for 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is making efforts to serve department stores".
The RER A crosses from west to east the Paris agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains travelled during peak hours, and almost no trains in off-peak hours, as planned.
Like Thursday, there was no crowd on the docks, the Francilians having organized themselves.
Thus in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, especially because of the absence of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "one thirty hours earlier, to make sure he arrived by the hour".
The station Saint-Lazare did not experience saturation, said SNCF, which had provided for the supervision of officers and law enforcement officers.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the Saint-Lazare train station to reach the metros.
New strikers' general meetings will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged by the trade unions to be "less" in a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, who demand a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in brackets, outraged the CGT, stressing that the management "was not doomed to solve a problem while in the drivers and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled Monday for "a broader examination of the conditions of practice of the profession", the RATP said.
This also made the unions say that the company "really mocked the weekend users".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at Paris headquarters.
It was then that the management, which had previously refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "for the sake of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to expand to the RER B on Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the daily million travelers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, receive between 2200 and 2700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros in bonuses, for off schedule hours, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court dissolved the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-eastern part of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which had just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "foyer of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", told the press the president of the Court Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required for the dissolution, said Mr Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as unlabelled parliamentarians.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered as a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party assures that it has "no organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict comes at a time when the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to stop Kurdish support for the PKK and to put an end to the conflict.
DTP leaders had claimed that a dissolution could lead to an increase in tensions in the south-east of Anatolian, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have escalated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
As soon as the court announced, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP's premises in Diyarbakir, the large south-eastern city, which is mostly populated by Kurds.
Law enforcement officers fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators threw molotov cocktails or stones, with fronds.
A hundred people also protested in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk claimed that the decision of the Justice would "enhanced despair".
Turkey cannot solve this question (Kurdish, ed.) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can, of course, expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the head of the road clearing and sanding service (FES) clearly states that it is not to bother citizens.
It is simply so that agents can test the vehicle technique and learn how to master them.
And according to the meterologists, it might well be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles stand ready to attack snow and ice.
The FES follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr Brauburger explains that as soon as he starts snowing on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, large sandblasting vehicles run 20 main routes (known as routes A).
This includes busy streets, main arteries such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire-fighting access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with a well-adhesive road melt in up to 3 hours of time.
This is why the FES service starts at 3 a.m. "so that the roads are cleared when the daily migration traffic begins".
Where it gets harder, it's when the snow starts falling at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the head of the road clearing and sandblasting department "because no motorist is willing to let salting vehicles pass".
Then, if it no longer snows, access roads and service roads - like the Rat-Beil-Straße - are taken care of.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr Brauburger is well aware that this still causes a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES hiking team starts to clear priority areas deemed dangerous and passages.
As for bike paths, FES services are generally unable to deal with them.
Mr Brauburger pointed out that there was a special service in Frankfurt which monitored the condition of bridges between 22h00 and 0430.
As the ice is very rapidly formed on these surfaces, salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also call on this special service when they need it.
The cradle of dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long by 1.50m high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with sickle claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would not have had anything exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin reports and his colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine, Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the supercontinent's land, the Pangea, and was towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, he tells us about the relationship, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
In 2006, Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and member of the excavation team tells that sometimes they find a dozen bones in one day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations revealed the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
The researchers named him Tawa after the word Hopi Indians for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a very exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he points out that it allows to confirm certain theories concerning the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
However, most of the oldest fossils are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the very first dinosaurs.
The experts wonder, among other things, at what time the saurians divided into three major evolutionary groups: the theropods (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaure and the velociraptor which appeared later and which descend from the birds, the sauropods, quadrupeds at the long neck, and those related to them and the herbivores ornithisches, which include species such as triceratops and stegosaure.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, known as S. Nesbitt.
Researchers found evidence that Tawa hallae had small aerial bags in its bones at the skull, as did the birds that are descendants of theropods.
These small pockets of air make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It appears that in Tawa hallae the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small aerial bags in its bones.
Since the related lineage of the immense sauropods also possessed aerial bags and a light frame, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive known dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers concluded that the saurians had appeared there.
As a result, the three major evolutionary lines divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, that is to say, all the land that formed the Pangeal Supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the paleontologists team also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, advance the researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History in New York and co-author of Science Studies magazine said there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, silesaure, which lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him this could give an erroneous view because there are a large number of fossils of dinosaurs in South America that have been preserved while there is virtually no one on other continents.
On the other hand, how did dinosaurs manage to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, is still a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of current crocodiles and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Trias dinosaurs spread over the entire planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a massive extinction that the dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or else, dinosaurs were better suited and were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, a group of animals which had also developed during the Trias and which since then has been vegetating in the shadows: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
There are those of lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec City, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the J.W. Goethe University casino in Frankfurt makes waves all over the world.
278 professors and teachers from J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protest students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English they condemn the intervention of the police demanded by the steering committee of the university.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers on strike after walls and works of art had been dazzled with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories considered that the degradations did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation is an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and teaching.
Focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and tries to make forget the reasons for the mobilization.
The University's Steering Committee thus avoided discussions that would be indispensable.
Court officers require that criminal proceedings be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not participate in the damage.
Legitimation of protests
The young people of the Verdi trade union in the services sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
Protests are just a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Regional Secretary for Youth of the Verdi Union.
The Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) took the case for the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and deterioration of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the regional parliament in Wiesbaden last Thursday on the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU Member of the Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD opposition, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Link)
Instead of thinking about the arguments and demands of the students, they are vacated.
The Left Party has tabled a motion which requires the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new Silicon Valley
For a long time it had the reputation of secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place for the search for secret weapons, under strict surveillance.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
There are important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics.
From September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd established links with Riedberg, a place of francfortian science – with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Protocol of close collaboration".
The signatories were Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose main focus is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the expanding Russian market.
In contrast, Russian scientific companies want contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
There are the Moscow Electrotechnical Institute, the leading companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literally translated "Green City") derives its name from the wooded hills at the heart of which the research centres are established.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The scope of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed high enough.
For his supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, into a desperate chaos of construction sites for about ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The head-end stations, with tracks ending in the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of 19th-century transportation technology that acted as a brake hoof for modern rail traffic because it used to take a long time to get the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that's what you have to do.
This is why the head-end stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train crossing station, which is about halfway on the Trans-European Railway Magistral between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long been incompatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of burying the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, the head-end stations no longer really pose problems of entry and exit since there are modern, reversible trains with railcars and driver car at both ends.
However, the construction of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and communal policies have prevailed.
The railway company is part of the party because it is the taxpayer who costs the risks of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From the urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – according to the graphs of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the enlargement of the section are designed for a traffic of people which was attributed - and this is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time there was not yet competition from cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than trucking on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabian project.
That's the official number.
Experts think ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other junctions and congestion points in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport's list.
One of the most important is the widening of the section through the Rhine valley by 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be very urgent to press the fungus thoroughly here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a brake hoof.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of international freight traffic in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews judgment on airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government raised the possibility of appealing to the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Court concerning the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had instructed experts to review from a legal point of view the judgement rendered by the Administrative Tribunal and which is a document of more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights in the event that the planned construction of the northwest landing runway at Frankfurt airport would take place.
The authorisation to alter 17 aircraft between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the Land government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air nuisances.
The coalition must have decided by 4 January if it wishes to appeal against the ruling.
The opposition criticises this delay and tries to put pressure on the government representative to appeal to the Federal Administrative Court of Leipzig.
The leader of the parliamentary group SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections, which consisted in banning night flights. Otherwise, it will be considered as a total breach of a given word.
It is quite difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's election slogan "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's criticism that the Land government is still trying to allow night flights by using "avocassery and blundering".
It takes time to conduct a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "first quick impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of the statements made by its party on the prohibition of night flights is completely flawed.
U.S. banks repay aid
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, are losing their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (more than €30 billion) in support of the Tarp rescue plan.
The American television channel CNBC indicated during a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid received.
Banking institutions thus seek to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the sums, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to managers and the settlement of higher fees.
The Bank of America launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors, which brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the sum comes from the bank's caisses, which are well-filled through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, Chief Executive Officer of the Bank of America, expressly thanked the US taxpayers: capital injection has greatly helped to overcome a difficult time.
The banking institution assumed its capacity by purchasing the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup is also considering obtaining money on the financial markets in order to free itself from state supervision.
The US bank could launch a 20 billion dollar capital increase on Thursday, reporting the CNBC channel citing the banking community.
The spokesperson for Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
By June Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
In the end, it all happened faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current chief editor Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs ZDF's Berlin editorial board, was the great favourite.
However, the channel did not want to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a willingness not to further harm ZDF steward Markus Schächter should the proposal not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14 members of the Commission.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter proposed to the Board of Directors that Nikolaus Brender's contract be extended for five years, but this was rejected.
Only seven members of the Council had expressed their support for the renewal of Brender and seven others had voted against it. Brender's removal by vote was a far-reaching but predictable failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is majority on the Board of Directors, had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to re-establish Brender.
Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly regarded editor-in-chief on the grounds that the rate of listening to ZDF's news programmes had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, fustigating the increasing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end there were even 35 experts in public law who had interfered in the debate and who felt that Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it won't have served anything.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (radio organ of Rhineland-Palatinate) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily of national scope).
In 1983 he became editor at the ZDF first of all in the news magazine "heute-journal" (newspaper of today).
Then his career continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was assistant editor-in-chief of the time; then correspondent to Washington in 1991/1992, then until 1998 he was chief and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bimonthly news programme presented in the morning); until 2001 he was head of the foreign policy department of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial board.
After Brender's disgrace, when he had just been elected journalist of the year by the magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch's opponent on the Board of Directors, Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF's Intergovernmental Treaty so that the intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of political figures who are members of the monitoring committees of the ZDF.
Peter Frey, Brender's probable successor had skilfully handled the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, as well as the Board of Directors could elect him without being expected to place a political partisan in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a left-wing liberal.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Conference of Rectors, an agreement was drawn up stipulating that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of the examinations: a single examination should allow the selected study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload will need to be re-constructed to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and institutions of higher education wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also undertaken to organise more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master's courses.
At regional level, there must be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Fewer exams
Since the start of student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have been constantly using the term "study" in their mouths.
But for the first time, this expression seems to have a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module should normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", can we read in a document of about 30 pages on the future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, it should be possible to stop the slippages, which significantly harmed the studyability.
In addition, "stuability" should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
Modules as well as the background need to be carefully examined to see if you can avoid this feeling of suffocation that you sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and flexibility to allow and foster personal initiative".
The new regulations will cover access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing ones.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory which depend on the accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to put pressure on the agencies so that the programmes were not too busy and the examination system was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate has so far been the only Land to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organise tutorial programmes and strengthen educational guidance offices as well as examination offices and the International Relations Department.
The Länder and universities have a budget of EUR 10 million.
In early 2010, the government wanted to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
As a result, only one examination will be required to complete his studies.
The organisation of studies must be more flexible, and it must be possible to guarantee the recognition of transcripts from other higher education institutions and access to the Master's degree must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "stuability" of all university cycles would have had to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the issue of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated, but criticism was heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students has indicated that he would like to see the organization of educational policy no longer "behind the closed doors" of ministers and university rectors in the future.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as concerned persons should be able to express themselves a little.
Future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of students is very useful to us", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for each graduate Bachelor to enrol in a Master's degree.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW steering committee, also asks that the Länder ensure that today's Bachelor students will have enough places tomorrow for Master's studies and study conditions as good as possible.
The Länder must therefore hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of reducing access to the Master's degree.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with these words "Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he thematizes in bribs of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a professor of German and English in Bucharest and later a collector in a youth publishing house before moving to Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the artist's house of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files".
Apparently destabilised and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged before his fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner was awarded the German Language Prize in 1989 in conjunction with some of the participants.
Enrollment trials began insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner "so someone who has not been able to withstand the intimidation tests of Security".
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoring of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his exemplary literary interminglings with the mechanisms of dictatorship power, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and lowness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own dossier Securitate, IM Walter played a role, assured literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interacted in his favour.
"He had been able to pull him out of all the difficult situations at the time," according to Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before this audience was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the security spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
We can assume that the victims will have made speculations and sometimes guessed what real names were hiding last the names of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
In contrast to Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
Systematic clarification has been repeatedly thwarted and curtailed in past years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Security (CNSAS) but the return of files has been rather dragged since.
A law has been in place since 2005 that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very disdainful way towards the laureate.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it was possible to express itself here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Of course, many inescapable issues are associated with the Söllner case as happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been robbed? The weighted reaction of the listeners, at Söllner's admission, let hope that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
Champions League tumults
It was felt that a representative was arriving there, shot four pins straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new coach VFB Christian Gross went up at midnight minus a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier in hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, let himself drive into the city which was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our five-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he had not drunk nor was he drunk of happiness.
He had had a nice evening, but tomorrow we had to get back to work.
Because it's now that it's about to start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just hired three days earlier were clear: "We did reach the eighth of the final", that is to say in the league of champions thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall back".
The "big job" is waiting for us on Sunday.
Here, it is a question of repeating to Mainz the results of the league of champions on a daily basis.
And it will be necessary to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three quick goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Drawing of lots
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16./17. + 23./24 February/ return game 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on December 18. in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel's successor's fulminant entry into office was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only in the one who had borne luck, who had passed on to the professionals of destabilised Stuttgart, an unfailing motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them that they had to focus on their assets, I advised them to be braver, explained the "plombier des Souls" – Gross – the recipe for success that sounded so well but that no longer had any effect with the nurse Babbel.
He unleashed a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - Babbel's supporter -, "in football when there is a new impulse sometimes happens things that would never have been possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of break for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" observed by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "It is someone who takes action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the course, warns the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs tenacity.
Just like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with the 0:4 , objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, pointed out that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We have not yet passed the difficult course.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday doesn't have the heart to party, even after the first home victory in three months, is due to the weekend events that a TV interview with goaltender Jens Lehmann bounced back just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others take and not Jens, countered Heldt, in response to Lehmann's acerbic criticism.
He accused the leadership of style weakness and said that she had decided to change coach under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also considered it a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his free day after the matches had been suppressed.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness" and announced consequences for the goaltender.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends for life these two quadragenaires.
In any case, they agreed with everything else, i.e. without the group's previous work by the replaced coach, strong sports and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "to a large extent in the success" replying Heldt and Lehmann in choir – and even the man in the plastic bag acquiesced.
Heavyweight World Championship
Warm battle in Bern: Kevin Johnson challenged him constantly verbally and gestually to provoke world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title as world champion of heavy goods vehicles according to the version of the federation WBC.
Unanimously, the judges imposed him on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as world champion for heavy goods vehicles.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a single-point victory against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time, Klitschko has been defending his title with honour since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously Ukrainian had already won twice the WBO and WBC World Championship title.
Unfortunately he didn't succeed in the long awaited KO.
Klitschko, out 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, had to confess twice his defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted above all to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2,02 meters, by its left counter.
Johnson, eleven centimeters smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's blows, thus preventing Klitschko from bringing his dangerous right-wing into play.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, tried mostly to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his blows only very rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having exceeded with Klitschko the distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko calling him "bad zombie" who "is not really capable".
During Friday's weighing, the champion couldn't help but provoke Johnson by knocking his sunglasses off his nose "to be able to see his eyes".
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a break of almost four years, he beat the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had had to abandon without a fight before.
This year, defending his title as champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just took a hit in this fight and am in perfect shape," said Klitschko to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko which was due to take place in September.
It seems that his promotion company is planning to have this game played now at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Greens' parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused Defense Minister Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz Affair.
The SPD and La Gauche parties (die Linke) ask the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After examining the latest information on the Kunduz air attack, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a counter-truth" on the killing of two tankers last September, said the leader of the Greens' parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD channel "Tagesschau" (the 8pm newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The killing order was issued in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report which NATO has at its disposal and which was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the aim of the strike was in reality not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured during the American air attack, which was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
On Saturday, the Greens, the SPD and the Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to speak as soon as possible before the Federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Government if the chancery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancery has in no way influenced the army's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were growing voices expressing doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to information from the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had provided to Guttenberg concerning the attack on the tankers was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden some disturbing details from the Minister.
In the vicinity of the two senior officials, however, it is suggested that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert has meanwhile requested in a letter a clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these charges and referred to the federal Parliament's commission of inquiry to be convened the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
Dream Worlds
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the psychically ill, or under the effect of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality merge.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie down in our darkened rooms, we can unfetteredly indulge in the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, the one who, awake, experiences the state of dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in psychic patients or under the effect of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes incites the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to blend.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can be presented in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and effect stand out, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitter substances of the brain - first and foremost dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - breaks and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The Earth's attraction force no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakened; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a character in a comic book.
His body is in two dimensions with stark colors.
The Earth's attraction no longer has power over him, he's hovering at the ceiling.
He's feeling a blow.
Behind him are winged devil creatures, grimating, bloody mouth, showing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Thundery, wicked voices scream, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of its stereo chain, makes it a loop and attaches it to a hook fixed to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and passes the loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop's coming off.
Let it be a lesson to you, shout the voices in a choir to tear the eardrum out of him. "Go to a clinic and get treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has lived six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, moreover it is manic-depressive, it takes medication against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
Approximately one percent of the population suffers at least once in their life from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner and outer worlds, they end up in a state of hyperexcitation, which makes them suffer hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter disruptive signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, Head of the Department of Psychiatry of the Heidelberg University Hospital (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is in the centre of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time it finds itself in a passive role, it is like a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience a hallucination once in his life.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved".
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real setting.
Why does our brain make this kind of cabrioles, is always a riddle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to lose momentarily the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the individuals involved have minimal brain damage.
It is assumed that neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is the way the abnormality of the neural system occurs and, moreover, the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses as they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive medicines to get rid of them while others buy very expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been gathering reports on hallucinations and phenomena of illusory images for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The unreal world in our head".
Hallucinations are part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also of an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions, are hyperactive or not sufficiently refrenated; when our brain heats up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as a brain injury or psychosis.
But also lack of stimulus, stress, love sorrows or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants acknowledge having experienced at least one hallucination in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania before and she goes to high school.
A young girl all to do normal to tell the truth.
If there weren't images and voices.
During recreation, a young boy, thin, with long chestnut hair, may speak to him.
When she answers her comrades look at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a whimsical dreamer but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this young man friendly.
Am I crazy?, she wonders sometimes.
But she knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night apparitions are, in general, frightening.
Often visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to take the class because the teacher is just presenting a new student in his eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations to the table.
At night apparitions are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for sleep that happens too rarely and far too late, she can often not make the distinction if she is awake or dreaming already, if the images she sees, the faces grimating or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she yells at these creatures.
She doesn't tell her parents or friends, they'd think she was crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact with the psychologist Kasten on the internet, she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the probability is great that they will hallucinate after a while.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, makes sure there's animation.
Sarah K., the only girl, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played on her own.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was of the age of thought, was not her real father.
It is the same brain zones that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience", according to Kasten "occurs in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, nocturnal dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychoses.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That's why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness, unfortunately, we quickly tend to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and physician head of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic of the Florence Nightingale hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful illness but also contains something positive, of creator - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oniroid form of experience, a particular form of modification of the consciousness awakened by the dream.
Oniroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when in a state of awakening.
The oniroid state of consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully aware, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of himself and of the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It's a mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
In fact, it is an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, an organizational capacity which is given to us, men, so as not to sink into the nothingness of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
Zurich's art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as an action to safeguard the soul.
He is 49 years old, when his conscious leaves for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen dives into a world he has created from all parts, visits foreign places, travels in time. He sees himself as an old man lying in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages among nobles who make blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a Greek motorcycle who takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the neve of the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
It absorbs completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen these interior journeys are fundamentally distinct from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes describing what he has experienced.
On the contrary of dreams, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and intensive than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience brings out the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oniroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a state of waking.
Any change in the state of consciousness, says psychologist Kasten "can cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snow can fall
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over from the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment as CEO of the Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly committed to joining society, said Hubert Burda, 69, at the Spiegel.
All details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
It will also be necessary to see if they are capable of doing so.
One cannot impose his children on 7500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
It would demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was withdrawing from the post of President-Director-General as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technology sector.
Later he took care of the treasury sector, that is to say he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the lead in marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time, it is not a family member who is at the head of Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old respectively, her son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's name is also used to link the next 10 or 15 years."
Burda states that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families that have been driven by a bulimia of capital, which have made huge unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That was never my strategy.
I never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I do not see myself in the role of the country's tutor as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken on too much importance.
Integrative beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is what El Corte Inglés has set itself, which has just opened in Callao shopping centre (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious brands such as Hedonai, laser hair removal specialist, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food department, especially a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds of food.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relax area in order to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax thanks to a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, there are 250 m2 in 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
For example, cavitation to fight against cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide customers' steps, offering them an entirely personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (heating and stretching included), are enough to work all the muscles of the body.
And if, after having our body worked, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi sign has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Various decolletations
Christmas approaches and it is never superfluous to study the look of stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, get the electric car
Endesa, in collaboration with the Ayuntamiento in Barcelona, created the "Oficina LIVE".
It is a project aimed at developing and promoting electric vehicles in the Catalan capital.
The "Oficina LIVE" (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the installation of the electric car in the city and will put in place agreements concerning mobility, by carrying out steps, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVALE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVALE Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
The power company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities related to energy, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa is involved in promoting the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has a series of complementary projects such as the G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a future of tranquility" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, foresees "a peaceful future" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
During the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without a Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, we would now have a landscape of abandonment and closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can envisage a peaceful future for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integrated Plan for the Automotive Sector (IPA), has allocated EUR 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 ancillary companies, which have mobilised an investment of more than EUR 3 000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, with reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the Autonomous Communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, the plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and contributed to a "strong increase" in registrations, which rose by 40 per cent in November.
20 000 m2 of vintage cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Exhibition of Collectible Cars, a meeting place for professionals and enthusiasts of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at Pabellón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only will it be possible to find motorcycles and vintage cars, but also at ClassicAuto Madrid items of all kinds linked to the world of the engine.
Thus, at the exhibitors of the pavilion, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in automotive sales, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of automobiles, or Cochera Clásicos, specialist of Mercedes Benz.
External aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this show will also include parallel activities: rallies, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Proficiency testing with automobiles and vintage motorcycles will also take place on a circuit outside the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A Sustainable Sporting Spirit
Mazda intends to prove that sportsmanship is not angry with respect for the environment.
For this purpose, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is only available on the 150 horsepower gasoline 2.0 engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good rating it has achieved as a whole.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and attachment.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control board and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
This is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and especially with the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to surpass.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this is a large chest with regular shapes.
The automatic engine shut-off and start system, at least for the moment, is only available on the two-litre, 150-hp gasoline engine with manual six-speed change.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its finesse, its low noise, its performances and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the Mazda3 are the most popular diesel models, those who do not operate a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, i.e. the one with the largest number of serial elements.
Among the standard equipment, the track changer assistant (VMR) which removes dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly noteworthy.
Moreover, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes among other elements adaptable bi-xenon headlights and a BOSE audio system with disk charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
In particular, it is illustrated by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not operate many kilometres per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 150 horsepower gasoline engine 2.0.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21 770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23 270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will offer us a great deal of satisfaction every day.
Luxury "Première"
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever dazzled us, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as it was used to, had opted for a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows to look at its email, without offering the possibility of even seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see him on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, which is less than half of what the iPhone's data subscription costs, for example.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is just as limited as his American grandfather, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it means to give up data when you cross a border or desperately look for a cafeteria on Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult your mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it has been working for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print.
Repeated reminders from the European Commission to propose affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely perceptible effect.
Outside the country of origin, we are reluctant to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have Wifi) offers this type of rate, means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals allowing them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no trouble.
This is a connected device and you pay when you buy it, not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with access to life as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a more just formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system.
Michelle's favourite color
Yellow is, no doubt, the favourite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the office of Barack Obama as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of that color, she chose, in fact, the same one to accompany him in the second moment, without a doubt, the most important of her life: the presentation in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on both occasions: besides their similar color, a yellow drawing towards the green with brilliant reflections, on both occasions, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So at first glance, it seems that the first lady of the United States follows the wake of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to put on the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If, on the other hand, for the taking up of office, it was a thick lace, it wore a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with medium heel for the first opportunity, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle also changed: the hair is now raised while she was wearing them released the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had work problems due to maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for young women who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study "Fecundity and professional career of women in Spain", carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, carried out on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers have had limited professional careers because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of married life and the number of children, whether or not the woman is working and the type of job she is employed.
Those who do not work outside the home, work part-time or have little stable work, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are pushing back into marriage and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 who have a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after moving into a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector."These data show that women in stable employment needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised largely influences maternity, but less the date of the beginning of the common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap between the marriage age of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference also persists among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years respectively on average.
"Another distinction also emerges between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary education marry and have their first child before finding stable employment, those who have completed middle or higher education reverse this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the brand, singing the universal motto "Because I'm worth it".
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities registered at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if select were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr.Grey, Anatomy Lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
British fashion prices
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His greatest representatives, creators and models, both yesterday and today, gathered for the annual presentation of their award, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vincent's Ace Poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de asses (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have passed through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
It does not do so according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by seeking something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither fear nor enlightenment.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you a few snapshots here.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, that very one that I felt without naming it: pleasure against fatal destiny, morals without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that nearly killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed through the north face, on which the best mountaineers are still and always taking hold."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
On his own, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the insane cry pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century, in its literary form, and he did so in the flight of himself and invoking post-eriority with a violent discourse to the maggots."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed: "Beloved God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser: "Sleep after effort,/ after storm, port,/ rest after war,/ after life, tired death delights."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally that she told her that Edward VII was spying on her between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We've never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was beyond madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it wasn't to try to hide Joyce from Baroja?
What else is Benet trying to get Baroja shot by Faulkner?
What did this do except to suck the glory of this man to serve him as a pedestal?"
A cowardly assault
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, a mele-blood, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying anything, they kicked her twice that left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what fun it is to attack a defenceless little animal who, moreover, was on a leash.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energumen who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., on either Tuesday, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been moaning all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint at the district police station even though we doubt that it will be of great use and in order not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly assassins were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what's going on with young people so they can find it fun to mistreat a defenseless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, helmet sets
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as the two structures have indicated today.
The purpose of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, as it is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which " goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products" and stated that it contributes to this objective through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet in two wheels, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure its widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are increasing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employers' union of the Anfac manufacturers and Ganvam, that of the dealers.
However, the good news should be nuanced, since the reference used for comparison in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a 60 % decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound of last month, registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, by adding all vehicles that fall into the light commercial vehicle category (from passenger cars, pick-up trucks, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95,853 have been sold.
The big clouds that most affect their demand have not dissipated. Indeed, although they are also purchased by private individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of cases pay with external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in limiting bank loans, there are other factors to be added, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In view of this situation and the difference between passenger vehicles, aid for the purchase of 2000E has been scarce.
In addition to private individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level of not more than 160 grams per kilometre may also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) was reiterated.
The association of dealers plans a year 2010 similar to the one that is ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of passenger vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency brake aid is now mandatory
As has happened with the ABS anti-lock brake system and as will take place with the ESP stability check, emergency brake assist systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a waiting period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure, imposed by the European Union, is to strengthen pedestrian protection, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear impacts.
The emergency brake assistant acts by increasing the brake pressure in the event of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the driver's kick.
But the latter does not always keep the pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the Bosch car component manufacturer, one third of the drivers involved in an accident could not press the brake before the collision, and half of them did not take advantage of its full strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in revancha, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such components, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is calculated that one in four accidents with injured persons would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, by means of radar or camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps him by increasing the pedal pressure, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is unavoidable, the device exerts the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize damage.
General Motors pushes back the Opel plan until January
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably on the 8th – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it will need more time to conclude Opel's rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends that each point of the plan has been approved beforehand by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with possible new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, is gaining importance.
In case there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
Driving the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest and precious jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to thin it by just less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to do without, in the first place, the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual tarmac roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, another 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of wins, to mount sports bacquets, still 12 kilos, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, earning another six kilograms and replacing door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual clutch PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual gearbox model, mainly on roads in California's secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car from riding on the ground with a plumb.
On the contrary, it's been a long time since we tested such a small and lightweight model that at the same time ensures as much safety in turns, including high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at low speed for the necessary time, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
This is what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Motor sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is abrupt, either when stopped or when recovered.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The pavement of the roads we travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car handled the chicken nests well.
The electronic assistants barely showed up all the way, while on some turns we found ice in the early morning and gravel later in the morning.
Ultimately, an ultra-light car, of the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be available for sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831.
“Bag Girl”
An intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house parades, the singer displays her face of bad girl with as much capacity as her Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", it's a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia takes victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a striking triumph at 91-82 during her visit to the hard terrain of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous absences suffered by Dusko Ivanovic's team. She is thus at the head of her group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight three-point baskets was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The Vitoria team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and collective work, even though it had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points scored, largely determined the final victory.
The game began quickly for the blues and reds, who took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, suggested that they had jumped on the Israeli field with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was received by cheers and applause back at his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to be noticed as the best player on his team, with 13 points scored, although Splitter's "less six" evaluation already hinted that this night was not going to be the best of Brazilian.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far away, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria's team that we don't win so easily on their field, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to making the yellows take advantage of the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from being dead, needed to chain up some skillful actions to get the air, and it was at this point that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun appeared, with three consecutive three-point baskets and the help of English and Ribas gave the counter back to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the locals managed to accentuate at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play the whole thing during the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they would not tire anyone of taking what they had deserved from them during the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign themselves and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis got closer in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
The Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to the Olympiacos and gave it the lead of Group B of the Euroligo, in a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the indoor game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the size of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter, made it possible to dream the Andalusians. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the inner game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to overturn the score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to function by showing its superiority in both sides, while the injury exit of the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal faults weighed on Unicaja.
Inner players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the 44-32 advantage in the 19th minute.
Impossible to climb back up
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos who, despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to equal the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, causing the leader of the group to stumble.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, wounded during the encounter.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left a little hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos was relentless when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of classified real estate ads, jobs and vehicles in Spain.
The tool "How much should you be paid?" calculates user salaries from more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For a week now the application has been running, the search engine has detected that, as a general rule, the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to data available to Trovit from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45 226 gross euros per year and a Frenchman receives 31 059 euros, while a Spanishman receives 24 000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives EUR 34 247 per annum in England, EUR 25 751 per annum in France and EUR 16 420 per annum in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11 592 euros net annually, followed by that of seller, with 14 725 euros, and that of worker, with 15 667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are that of driver, part-time and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overturned president will have to abandon the diplomatic delegation no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term.
Francisco Catunda, Chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he has to leave the Embassy, where he has been a refugee since 21 September, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, at the end of his mandate, he must look for another destination."
The channel also quoted the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the 29 November elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, in the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, since Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After pink days since last spring, during which asset inflation was the dominant market score, uncertainty once again arises, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future by nature uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilise.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been virtually finalised and, without calling into question their non-conformist liquidity policy, are beginning to put some sand in the workings, as the ECB has done, with their one-year auction next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction in risk premiums.
Stock exchange volatility and corporate bond spreads are again increasing, although they remain far removed from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
There is once again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the havens chosen by investors, provoking an increase in the differences between the countries of the euro area and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a further downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral risk, who were again trying to provoke a case of conscience among those responsible for world economic policy who had curbed the destructive effects of credit limitation on the destruction of employment, whereas what should be done is decreed a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore its place to power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the rose pot.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational if Ecofin saved Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allowed a euro area member country to fail to meet its commitments.
What makes sense, however, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads increase to the extent of European corporate bonds, we do not have to worry.
If European differences narrowed and ours continued to increase, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery models and revise their forecasts for 2011 upwards, with the OECD and the European Commission, who are returning to the burden with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not give much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment "prudence is mother of security".
Connected sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday, before the sub-committee of the Congress of Deputies, where the energy strategy of Spain is discussed these days for the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán sketched out for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommission, eight-close.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 million euros until 2020 and 60 000 million more between that date and 2030, in the event that nuclear power plants now in operation remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
Starting in 2020, the issue will change, and the power will have to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal-fired power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that an additional 18,000 MW are needed, together with other "supportive energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Law that the government has just approved is in line with what his company is demanding, did not wish to attack the royal decree aimed at encouraging the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this direction, despite the "one-off" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any event, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although in the long term, should start to be taken, as they take some time to reach maturity and that a stable remunerative framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling market at ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the role of privileged partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a collaboration protocol to create the Centre for Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation.
The alliance expects an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to conduct energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Acciona fights its first highway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first highway concession in Australia, a market on which she already works as an energy company and water manager.
The construction site at stake is a tunnel estimated at 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A five-kilometre long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and motorway dealership.
The city council wishes to be able to dispose of it by the end of 2014.
After having chosen the public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Ernsts & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their offers next May, the planned investment amounts to A$ 1,700 million (about €1,047 million) and in the last phase confronts three consortia, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in smooth, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest manufacturers, while the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe's leading underground construction specialists.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer group Bouygues, is building.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major construction projects and privatizations, but entering them is a major challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by the already mentioned companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, in addition to their Asian references, and which still remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just won a place in this market by its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona relies on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the sector of desalination.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and heads the grouping of companies responsible for building and managing Adelaide's desalinator, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground toll road, promoted by the City of Brisbane Infrastructure Office and the Northern Link (northbound link), will connect the Western Highway from Toowong to the Peripheral Highway at Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the Administration indicates that the tender will take place in the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be opened to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the yard will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will consist of two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide A$500 million (EUR308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work to Hochtief
Australia continues to make Hochtief much more fruitful, which mentioned yesterday that it had obtained a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national fibre optic broadband network.
This intervention will enable 400,000 people to have quick access to the Internet and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has ceded the construction project of the 27-story King George Tower in the city of Brisbane. Work has not yet begun and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for an amount of EUR 64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after seeing itself in charge of the work of widening the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The construction project is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Sra. Rushmore gets adjudicated Renfe's advertisement
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, said the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was chosen from 16 agencies that presented themselves to the tender organized by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity over the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the countryside.
A fine of 63 million in France Telecom to curb competition
The French competition regulator fined France Telecom €63 million for its anti-competitive conduct in the country's Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it places on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore a repeat offender.
An application shop
On the other hand, the mobile phone subsidiary of the French company has followed the footsteps of other operators and has opened an Internet app shop, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, Orange's app shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will take 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has earned 476.4 million in Real Madrid and Barça since its creation.
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, placing them in third and fifth place among the clubs that took the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
Indeed, the competition allocated €5,362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish teams) who participated in the event since the tournament's inception during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third in the continent to earn the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, won three times the trophy.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, as far as the money reported by the Champions League is concerned, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by UEFA's complex money-sharing procedure.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, the UEFA will spend 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification games (among which the Atlético of Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth of the final receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarter of the final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are spent.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four seats.
The champion of the previous year pocketes 40% of the allocated money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other game will be paid based on the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the offer to purchase shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a public bid (POA) for all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers €1.5025 per share, which will be paid out in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this carry-over.
Yesterday Sos' shares ended at €1.85; Nueva Rumasa's offer therefore estimates the company to be 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects Sos' actual valuation.
The offer is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of the securities.
CNMV stated that it had not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it took place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos' capital is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos is continuing to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible offers of purchase and goes and comes judicial of its former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as Internal Audit Director.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a leadership position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not free of controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the supposed diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal further misappropriation of funds cannot be ruled out.
Regarding credit to Salazar, former Councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the JCC and Unicaja) said yesterday in front of the National Hearing that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes Paternina's exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorised the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it allowed this transaction because it understood that its terms were in keeping with the standards in force and that it considered the contents of the explanatory sheet submitted to be "sufficient" as a result of the amendments implemented on December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95 % of the share capital, composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
He further explained that 5 592 778 million shares have been immobilized, and that they could not in any way be transmitted before the finalisation of the offer, of which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the standards in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a loss are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each claim is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labour time can be a long and complex work.
Calculating by hand the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labour can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest IT tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Providers of services and solutions for disaster assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
The other companies competing in the field of assessment tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales manager of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous 15 years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies start working.
This is a very difficult task, because it is necessary to catalogue each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and record its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image of each model is created on which you can click on the different parts of a passenger car.
If it is a massively sold model, the work can be ready in a week if the process moves very quickly.
If it is a low-sold car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information about Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in use, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and development of the databases, Audatex has eight centres throughout the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas, Madrid.
There, more than 100 technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests $90 million each year to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer various products.
The most common application is for repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of break parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide to the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose it in our country, but it does so in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting schedules.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it is removed from the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows to bid on vehicles declared wrecks.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geo-demographic analyses or knowing common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand have gone to the garage for a breakdown or how many have suffered serious claims for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer's official parts, prices and times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of accidents, breakdowns or car maintenance.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a historical reference product in the marketplace.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its volume of business has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the last three years, with a turnover of €10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it began its process of internationalization, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and moved to Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be 557 million dollars, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Solera Group was listed on a $1,000 million stock exchange, and today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, he has been on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark.
Internet auctions of rough cars
Last October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of damaged cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, breakage and professional sellers who must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650 000 operations across Europe, including 500 000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 vendors and 4000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collected cars can be re-recorded, although they have been removed, after complex steps.
Four-step garage quote
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatx guarantees that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are resistant to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are required.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, bonuses or discounts, and then print out the quote to hand it over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated labour time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to ensure that these images are in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
