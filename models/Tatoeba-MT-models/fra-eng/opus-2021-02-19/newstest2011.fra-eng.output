What is going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new elected CSSD at the capital city hall will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier in order to understand themselves at the municipal council level with their old and new colleagues of the SDO.
The daily Actualne.cz has "tested" the new members of the city council belonging to CSSD, whether they know the cavern that was born in the last years at the town hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition who were leading in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political cream launched during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was with surprise that it was discovered that the new elected officials did not understand the known terms very well.
At least they say so.
"Who's Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I'm a young man in Pragois politics has reacted Lukas Kaucky, the chosen to culture to the test of the vocabulary of the "sponsor".
And as far as the political veteran is concerned, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
"It's the only expression among the ones you suggest I use"
Otherwise, I don't use the agrôt.
From the vocabulary, of which the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-electoral congress of the SDO, the editorial board chose 6 examples, first of all those linked with the city hall of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the patisserie, "beef nerve", "treason of the capital" and "enter".
Three of the elected officials agreed on the quiz, the fourth- Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek totally refused the test.
"I don't care at all about these things and how the representatives of citizen democracy have fun: I won't give my opinion."
"I'm working on how we're going to understand each other in our programs," he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the legend above, that it is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to'Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," said Kaucky and immediately added: "But I know it from the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the chosen for the environment, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two Social Democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of the meaning of "go to the pastry".
"It is, I think, a matter of going to a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it is the head office of the companies of Janousek.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests there is no agrôt lexicon in social democracy.
"I took advice with colleagues and it appears that we really don't have anything of this type."
"We say to ourselves the names sometimes we use abbreviations and symbols," says Peter Hlinsky, president of the Social Democratic Party, which the members of the Party call Hulda.
"They called me Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," admits Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily Actual.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for the members of the Party or the least friendly Little old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by scams during the party's sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones that the social democrats admit to use within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda much, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this Pragois president.
"Doctor of baton law," it seems, recalls that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title of Doctor of Law JUDr. at the Police Academy of Bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of witches, published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
Rather, they are part of the old generation, cannot work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The woman who becomes a witch is isolated in order not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man has very rarely this fate."
"We also do not judge young women in good health because they participate in work and give birth to children," says a sister who works in the capital of West Africa, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He published a brochure that should help limit witch hunting.
There's a "hic" in the case.
"More than 70 per cent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the daily Die Standard warned about the disadvantage of written education.
The charge of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighbor of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil that they sprayed on her.
This information was transmitted by the BBC server.
Criminals say it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil that is used for ritual anointings has been caught in contact with the woman.
The oil flaming, it seems, when the team wanted to "hunt the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of witches is approved by people at all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human spirit eaters have always been a danger," he says.
As Burkina Faso strives to reduce witch hunting, the Gambia is no later than last year even saw the President himself participate in it.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a large witch hunt which, it seems, would have participated in his death and would have tried by black magic to also kill the President."
"Hamans from nearby Guinea came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal guard of the President, men and women randomly chosen from villages in Gambia," said Amnesty International in a message.
On the farm imprisoned people had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects which in addition caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
About a thousand people were released from international pressure.
The tenant of Bakal: The stoves are heating, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man came out of the door of the RPG Byty customer centre of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new leases for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and son who is serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 second category apartment 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works with solid fuel", points out on his son's new contract the man who has the power of signature.
"But I signed it anyway," he explains, moaning angry and half resigned.
The citizens' association of BytyOKD.cz apartments which has described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, the date on which a notice will be published explaining the method to be followed to claim.
But the man reacts to this by a gesture of the hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" by frowning.
The Ostrava region became the laboratory for deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not match the market price.
Aktualne.cz therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The waiting room of RPG in Havirovska Street is one of the four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Right next door stands a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "Loyer 2011", is on the touch screen.
Only one pressure and one paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number already starts to light up on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it's your turn.
After a short while, an old couple arrives to find out about rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to solve common problems like everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44000 apartments in RPG's portfolio receive mail with new leases in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers rent increases of 15 to 38 per cent.
The special window for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It has been working for almost a week, so it's still on trial," answers, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the window when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The deragulation and former apartments of minors of Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of parliament and from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported this in a fairly sustained manner before the elections and it now fills the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change me a put...n board in the toilets, relieves himself in introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to make sure that they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they sign now as promised by RPG in a special offer.
This is a discount of half the amount of rent that will be received by the other lessees who have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by the questions.
"Of the 360 clients who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," says the employee at the counter.
And yet RPG porposes both on its website and in the windows individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent, an independent tribunal will make the decision.
'These are not threats but only to inform about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,' says RPG on his website.
"Here no one will go to court" thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man in the street in front of the customer center is right.
"I have 13,000 retirement crowns and I have 5000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and so people wait," she says.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG has been able with rents to invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hung on the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs of the waiting room of Havirosvka Street, however repeats some information indicated in red.
'The rent increase in 2011 is 15 per cent and covers no less than 31,200 apartments, or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments'.
"And it will always be no more than 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," says the screen.
The 38 per cent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, it is an increase of a really very low amount 19.66 Czech crowns per square metre", adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see the graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of savings of heating - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement have priority.
The nursery school is also part of the offices that have included architects.
The administrative building Avriopoint of Brno is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini kindergarten with everything you need - color walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of Arch. design employees can go there.
The architectonic-project company Arch. Design. whose workshops produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini nursery school of enterprise since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially from the age of making children, and it was important that women architects and project managers should be able to return to work quickly.
At the same time as reduced-time employment contracts, the nursery school is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work taking care of children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who conceived this nursery school and with the support of the management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-school is financed by the European Social Fund through the Human Resources Operational Programme and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
They were able to purchase equipment and appliances and, after two years, to provide qualified personnel and start-up.
After the use of the endowment of funding (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini nursery school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and Economy rating helped to make the staffing request.
Children are cared for by qualified staff, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of the children all day long. Children can go to nursery school without any age limit, but most of them are over three years old.
Since it is a "mini nursery school" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who replace themselves.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it takes on individual care and education, the curriculum of the mini nursery school is comparable to that of pre-school education.
Children are not only playing, but quality education is also provided - from the beginning to school preparation, English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and not have the stress of being late to pick up the children from a school away from the parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design. has thus registered among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and that are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens the marketing of HR.
The bone house fascinates again after 100 years. Take a look at Gaudi's interiors.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric saurien, the staircase to a dinosaur spine and the balconies to open fish mouths.
Thus is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona of architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house received the nickname "House in Bones" from the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, façade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is ypical for the Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaudi.
The front façade of the house unfolds its dream lines, pleasant colors and textures that recall nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation one sees the geometry, the rhythm and the order thought with precision.
In the night the façade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brilliance of colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measurement.
Wood reproduces in waves the window frames, balustrades, decorative elements of doors, eyepieces and slats.
The Battlo house which stands in the Eixample district on the Passeig de Gracia shopping street at number 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another brand new but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-dwelling house was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations were born for a representation apartment of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade.
For the façade have also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for Casa Battlo's plans began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi Casa Mila's house and Guell Park in which there are other Gaudi's works.
The locals nicknamed the hot house just after its finish because of its organic shapes "the Bone House".
Others, having regard to the specific mechanism of opening windows, called it "the house that swarms".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron of Catalonia.
Other elements of construction sculpture contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its time of central heating, with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination seems odd.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not comply with the construction directives of then and did not allow himself to be obstructed by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained a building permit from the city, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the finishing the city council was horrified and asked for modifications.
For example, members of the municipal council were not pleased that the pillars of construction were encroaching on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and in the third there was a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which one accesses to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the lounges and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit itself to the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi received besides new facades a non-traditional roof and two floors in addition.
Gaudi's play with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which is decorated the inner courtyard and with the skylights.
The two-colour game gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that the white reflects more than the dark that on the contrary absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house, which was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund, may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found it to be a lucrative business and extended the scope of the visits to common areas and the attic, including toit terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discounts.
The sum is still above the entrance price to Gaudi's other buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the residents of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a bed base: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for the bed, so the mattress and base give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive: weight, height, age, state of health as well as sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and base are to be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where latex mattresses are not constantly sleeping, they are not suitable because they "warm up" slowly.
In addition, they have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they do not also have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mould can also form there.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
Anyone who spends the time abroad where very thick mattresses with a softening layer are frequently used, will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all the hokeyists who come back from NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a soft layer of lazy foam."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder which therefore assume "information" poorly of joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the Hokeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything works well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses for example.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to be able to enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won't turn back in the night like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works as a shield against scales.
To choose the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, i.e. about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of 180cm need a bed of 210/220cm.
The minimum width for each for a two-seater bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm in total.
For single beds, singles for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should lay hands comfortably with the elbows slightly bent. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-matresses and decorators who for several years has devoted himself to the problem of a healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaches it in specialized schools.
For a two-seater bed each needs its own bed base and mattress, so be careful, however, during the shop to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise, you only have to mount the base at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which count for the layer of shape and ventilation at least three cm.
"To the touch or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-defined type of base.
The bed-spring, when the mattress and the bed base are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; it should not be washed, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night we normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and blocked) sieve.
For this the specialists refuse to make a claim over a life of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But everything to his but.
And for this an expert advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the coating of the mattress, hygiene or washing but rather add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to manufacture coatings with zippers for the whole set, that is to say that after opening you have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise handling for the big models (and for one person only) becomes when you remove them a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a bed base?
Never!
At most for a bed intended for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are none) with ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with sacheted springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an aeration layer.
A polyurethane mattress must not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-position slatted mattresses with 14/18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut) are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are doubled in the lower part of the kidneys and it is thus possible to regulate the stiffness of the slats.
For multi-position mattresses, spring mattresses should not be taken because they do not respond to changes in position.
Next to the adjustment of the rigidity of the slats one can also install what is called a shoulder cradle.
It is a special bond of the slats that allows to press or even tilt the slat so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have "shoulders as wide as their backs," this is really an important thing.
This thing is already being considered by mattress manufacturers who for the "masculines" have begun to use a softening area at shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they offer them a softer surface at the hips again.
For the most difficult customer there are winged or padded sommers with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure dissipates in more points and diinates the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated with air) on good mattresses and mattresses, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians prefer by example.
When lying on the side, the pillow must upgrade (with the shoulder cradle of the base or the area softened in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also to organic mattress.
The petrole-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soya oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soy.
"The Bio qualifier for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add microcapsules that develop perfumes of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of birch plants so that the coating of the mattress absorbs the heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
The current favourites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cellular structure so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know precisely where the head, lower back and feet are located.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7,000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterised by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached first place.
Saving for the mattress and the bed base is not easy.
From time to time, two mattresses may be used by manufacturers or producers in special actions for the price of one mattress.
Like for example the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam stitched to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course, we can take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with Tempur material at a "cosmic" rhythm.
This began as a matter for NASA because astronauts were subjected to huge load factors at start-up.
Tempur softens in heat and hardens, on the contrary, in cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes an optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this purpose against sleeping sickness and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special cushions for feet that relieve legs and the venous system.
Czech manufacturers use e.g. EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to follow people are increasingly required by parents who want to watch over their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about watching them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can also be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases as exemple that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a match box but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved a large number of people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not spying but only another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, one of the Czech market's suppliers of tracking devices.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware of it, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
"The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons," says Pilin.
According to him children should always know for what purpose "the box" is used and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to deal with him something of this type, he will get rid of it.
'And even the smaller ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something on purpose when they don't want to be under control'.
"Mobile phones, which can cut themselves like these tracking devices, have already led parents to long expectations," says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of an attack is highly questionable.
"If it is a prepared abduction, the author will do everything possible to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him."
"Currently, it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracing devices develop, they (the criminals) will also seek them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign".
"In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
She admits, however, that such devices can help in an assault not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, it says that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an assault.
"The apparatus may be configured in such a way that it is in regular emission after a specified period of time".
"In the event that the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the data subject".
"The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and finds himself in a lying position without moving," says Cech.
According to him the so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after formatting it with a special prological.
The problem with current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn as a pendant the size of a match box or the smallest telephone sets.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"It will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he'll realize it after a while, which will give the police a little more time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as for tracing cars.
This is a combination of GPS position acquisition systems (which is commonly used in auto-navigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating ropes that it could tour the Czech Republic with it. But it can only last two years.
The army bought 445 km of cords used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense had bought 224 km of them.
So the army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the ropes is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating ropes from the STV Group limited company for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as reason for the stumbling of a huge amount of detonating ropes at MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by military pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it is clear that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or householders should have an annual exercise in explosives.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating ropes.
At this distance is 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army reserves could support it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, it is sufficient for more than 2 m of detonating ropes, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase ensured - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the Rapid Intervention Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that firing sessions are limited due to the need for money.
We don't talk about the lack of body linen.
"And I don't take my head if they buy so much detonating cords from us."
"And it's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"For us the army is a good customer that we strive as traders to satisfy," says STV Group Sales Director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of kilometres of detonating ropes will be set aside by the army for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reported only four years of life of the detonating cords and the police and army pyrotechnicians of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can go up to four years," says one of them, who does not want his name to be published in light of the army's criticism.
Each munition must be tested to see if it remains integrative and does not threaten the soldier's life.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The Department's other argument is a reduction due to quantity for 445 km of detonating ropes.
"They cost us 60 per cent less than last year's supply of 245 km," says spokesperson Pejsek, who interprets the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their lifetime.
This has been established for reasons of safety of pyrotechnicians and also to be able to obtain more modern and reliable types of detonating ropes in a more flexible way.
The Ministry of Defence today has major problems for the neutralisation of tens of tons of ammunition coming from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army strong of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading on the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating ropes that it now buys "cheaply".
Until now, I have benefited from contacts that I have obtained through the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the competition of the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of last year's Best Individual Entrepreneur competition was 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukas Pytloun.
His adventure towards success is like in a film.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Libérec there was missing a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a graduate student, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of accommodation in our region has made me want to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building which he converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has enabled him to open in Libérec 4 pensions, two restaurants of style and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year he received another one of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other Pytloun franchise candidates came forward," the number 1 of last year's entrepreneurs.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the entrepreneur of the year contest has served well," adds Pytloun with gratitude.
Victory brought him more popularity and to be known at Liberek and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It's not necessary to win, but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he's been using his contacts and knowledge until now that he couldn't have gotten in any other way.
"With those I met through the contest I started to maintain business relations regularly.
According to him, the reputation for success also had an impact on employees.
And he's got about 70.
"I observe at home above all the loyalty and pride of having engaged in something that has been generally recognized."
"This is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of the goal of winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of SEK 100 million.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me, my staff and increased our self-confidence to fight competition," said the winner of last year's competition today.
At the beginning of Farmet's history there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some comrades in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not very long after they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, it has become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even to the non-specialized public after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers really get to know the Farmet brand better, but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were collaborating with a company that has achieved the greatest success in its country of origin," says Zdarsky.
But the past year has not been at Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The valuation of the company was based on the economic results of 2008 and in part of 2009.
And precisely in 2009 this was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We obviously did not escape this situation."
"The turnover dropped by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off," Zdarsky explains.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation properly and kept the results profitable even though they were inferior to those they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued uncompromisingly to invest in research and development.
"We built with endowments a training and research center, strengthened the presentation of the company in international fairs and won the main awards in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything leads us to believe that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of affires go back and with them the number of employees also.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes insane regulations.
The Absurdity of the Year investigation is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be removed.
The little glorious winner of this year's survey on the Absurdity of the Year was the obligation to bring to the offices documents that officials can obtain on-line.
More than one third of the 4,000 voters voted for this.
For example, the social affairs authorities requested a paper extract from the business register while the official could obtain it in two clicks of a mouse.
It changes because of the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require the extract from the Trade Register for insurance payment controls," said Jana Buranova, spokesperson for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs have to fill in in the Czech Republic and to remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this contest of the Absurdity of the Year.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3000 voters came forward, at least 4000 this year brought their votes.
And it's not surprising, there are in our country the most various legal obligations that only slow down the company, and, this, more and more.
"We may be among the documents to fill out for tax returns in the top places in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is in 74th place in terms of business conditions, an increase of 8 places compared to last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first launched in 2006 and continues each year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic absurdities every year from April to the end of September, the last time before the competition is closed.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest selects seven candidates for "the prize" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received the highest number of votes is declared the winner.
Until last year's survey, it's about a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore, among the nominees is the obligation for motorway and high-speed road maintenance vehicles to pay tolls, or for contractors with twenty employees to repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the contest, which always starts in early November at Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which personalities of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the highlight of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts astons in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my objective is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs which today only complicate the company', said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd decrements is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what was not pleasing to people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days before to the office for the individual company at the place where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the amendment of the Single Enterprise Act.
The second most popular requirement in 2007 was to report to the Labour Office a 30-day tour of duty for a foreign employee, which was removed with the so-called Green Card Act.
And everything's fine until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decreed for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their practice, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training or sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the Year 2010.
The onjective of this competition is reasonable and fair business support.
"We want to support companies that monitor their company's environmental impacts and conduct socially responsible business," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the rebel contest of the year.
For this first year of this sub-category of the firm's contest of 2010, organized by Vodaphone, have registered companies that have not succeeded with a single long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each of them is full of inspirations and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be seen as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic is not an example of the Pragois and Netera prological society that supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
The old paper manufacturing plant in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of its employees, has obtained the title of Head of the Central Bohemia Region and has placed third in the region at the competition of the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who has won for introducing flexible working hours and even decreased up to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionately, lower wages.
The jury also awarded her the title because she buys first of all from Czech manufacturers, supports a ditoyan activity in the nearby environment and cares about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment," says Miluse Ryznarova, the company's executive director.
the company responsible IT Enlogit of the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has set them up for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the Man in the Shadow Foundation that helps the local Roma community," says Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
At the very last rank is, also for its activities, a company of washing and cleaning of the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increased skills and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the construction company of Bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition, who had responded to the questionnaire as an attachment to the registration document and had referred it to the organizer by August 15, were automatically registered in the responsible company category.
Uncompleted or incomplete responses in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in competition had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the firm responsible but were not disqualified from the competition "principal" the Firm of the Year of Vodaphone".
"Independent registration is not possible because it is a sub-category of the main competition of the Firm of the Year," says Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, the police made arrests during a public competition
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives passed the handcuffs to the local entrepreneur and shopper in Lubos real estate.
The latter had endeavoured to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a request for restitution in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a particular candidate.
This one had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider trading in the context of a public tender and competition," said for the newspaper Pravo the head of the Prosecutor's Office of Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is under way.
The police released the 46-year-old entrepreneur after 24 hours.
To know how it could affect a public competition, one can only speculate in view of so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, the spokesman of the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund stated that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen at a separate place of work during the public competition.
"It was a client and under no circumstances an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land according to the Land Act" and is set up when several legal candidates manifest themselves.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to re-securities which must be settled before the value of the land is announced".
"According to the proposed rights a ranking of the buyers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights", explained the spokesperson of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information concerning the persons who had registered for the appeal and since he is himself, also, a beneficiary because he had bought a large number of restitution rights, he had offered the candidates on the ground not to participate in the competition.
And he probably cashed in by withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above the standards at the FdT (Land Fund).
He appeared in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted in criminal proceedings for publishing land for which the decision to set up a building had already been published.
For example, Lubos G. had obtained land for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the artery of access to the industrial zone of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is by far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it risked putting the construction in jeopardy by blocking the land.
Households will pay a supplement of about 100 crowns per month for housing.
Households will have to pay a supplement from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
Families will therefore have to draw from their wallets from January up to a hundred crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to one-tenth more for water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be close to 100 more kroner per apartment per year than at present.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices given the significant development in encouraging the manufacture of renewable energy, particularly photovoltaic batteries.
The gas increases moderately but of course at a time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
One can therefore also count a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in central heating prices differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 more crowns per month, the families of Libérec will pay more than 1,000 crowns annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague is preparing a 9 percent increase in water and sanitation for the case where the city increases the infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the pragons will pay an extra 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest compared to the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 percent.
Rent prices will increase significantly, for example, in the 450 thousand apartments rented from January onwards, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example the company CPI Byty which owns in Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments, has decided an increase up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by the company.
The regulated rents that people pay in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk with rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts softly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best whisky brand are stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in the hospital for re-offending are no exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to the admissions of children's departments in hospitals.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to get drunk."
'The trend is really strong alcohols', says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department at Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chip a bottle of daddy in the wardrobe, it is sometimes a wisky but it is the fernet and vodka that prevail."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not feel it," explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman for the Motol hospital, is also right.
"It's usually rum or fernet."
"It is today the trendy alcohol especially in elementary schools".
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought home," added Jurinova.
According to the Head of Department Pelikan, seeing drunk children between the ages of 13 and 14 in hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he practised for ten years in paediatrics where ambulances brought school children from wide, completely drunk neighbourhoods.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times
"She started her career at the age of twelve when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with in addition a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"The interesting thing is that it doesn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter is away for 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the unselfishness of the parents or their extraordinary tolerance for the fact that their offspring indulge in drinking, which is the main cause of the development of alcoholism among children.
According to experts, however, there is no mention of dependence, in its strict sense, on children.
"Under the term alcoholic one hears a chronic dependence on alcohol of several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that one does not find in children".
"In those who use repeat alcohol, it is more a socio-familial background that is significantly unfavourable," explained the Head of Department Pelikan.
According to spokesperson Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with grâve poisoning requiring hospitalization are included in statistics.
Children who are drunk after the emergency care brought home by the parents or the police, are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit down and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pelikan he exsites three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of witches, the saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"If they drink out of spite after bad results, on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holiday".
"Of course I lived on witch day an admission of 7 drunken children at once," said Pelikan.
The drunk child who spent the night in the hospital undergoing medically controlled detoxification is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffers the day after the "wood hog".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better off because they spend an excellent evening then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them".
"They are only surprised at where they are," adds Pelikan, knowing that from time to time this spoils the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and intensive care bed hospitalization can reach tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their drunkenness cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to pay back a single evening," Pelikan added.
However, in his view, the health insurance companies in their declining management, which should recover care expenses from parents, do not deal with cases of children who are drunk.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 of the five aircraft, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off Tuesday to Seville, Spain, where the manufacturer of Casa-EADS aircraft is based.
This is the first time that aircraft of this type have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad for demonstration exercises or flights.
These are the two-place versions of the L-159T1 that were up to now in service in the Czech Army and were in flight condition.
The three remaining devices are single-seater versions of the L-159.
They are currently stationed at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of the Vodochody aircraft is currently unknown.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft planned for the exchange were taken from long-stored aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The L-159 T1 seats were exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army would not be left without two seats since the ministry signed an agreement with Aéro Vodochody in May 2009 worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 single-seaters into two two-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second aircraft scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it is committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
"In the contract it is clearly stated that the one who takes the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used for the training of pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the one who takes into account how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa plane and the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not tender and contacted EADS directly.
The Defence Directorate argued that the exchange ensures a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aéro Vodochody and only uses 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will probably have judicial implications.
the European Commission has nevertheless lodged a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because the planes should have been chosen in the framework of a European-wide tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the ring finger is a sign of low cancer risk
Men with a longer index than the ring finger are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men under the age of 60," declared the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, adds Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Great Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the right hand index shorter than the ring finger.
For them, as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, we found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the annular, however, the risk fell to 33 per cent, for men before age 60, the decrease in risk reached 87 per cent.
The length ratio of the two fingers mentioned - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, in particular, different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is testosterone that helps develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said for TKC that he is aware of this study but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, motorways D1 and D5 are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On roads and sidewalks, there is most of the time compact snow, the clearing machines worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and the 93rd kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno towards Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Automobile Club Central (UAMK) told the news
At the 91st kilometer a truck was crashed, at the 93rd two heavy trucks hit, the accident injured.
Several cars were also found in the ditch.
The problems are also on the highway D1 at 185th kilometer in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at 190 km or go by Brno and then enter at 182 km to Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometers has formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just upon arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimetres thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, car lines are being created in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also blocked.
The safest means of transportation is the subway.
Trams are delayed, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the Prague Crisis Staff has yet to meet.
There are also problems with the railways and the airport.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove 7 fast links due to snow.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11:00 a.m. in the night until 5:00 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but increasing vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impassable, on the road to Brno there are beginning to be snow gusts in places and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass some communication routes in the places above.
The region of Vyskov was one of the most affected places.
So far the axes are closed: Rusinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, it may be necessary to send snow plowers and snow strawberries.
We can't estimate it right now when they're rolling.
On the road to Hodonin caution is required in the white Carpathian region.
On roads that are, with regard to the protection of nature, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimetres of snow warns TKC.
In Czech Republic, it fell between two and 10 centimetres of snow; it fell most in northern Bohemia, often with up to 18 centimetres of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell up to 15 centimetres of snow.
The snow is gradually disappearing in Czech Republic.
The Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army sent a new "intelligent" weapon to Afghnistan, known only as code XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precise cannon.
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special 25 mm calibre ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly breaking explosive, actually works like small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it explodes in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is also not protected from above and when it falls on a deadly rain of steel bursts, it can put it out of combat too.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtains a precise point of sight, according to which he corrects his sighting site and presses the relaxation.
"Let's say you shot at 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the weapon loads and pulls at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters," said Audette.
400 off-site jobs
Fujitsu Group relocates its Bad Homburg subsidiary to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer to Astro Park their workplace, which is currently located at the Mareinbader Square office building in the Bad Homburg area.
The Japanese Fujitsu group relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer manufacturing and maintenance giant said on Wednesday, next year in July, the 400 men and women's workplace, located so far on the Marienbader Square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße Street in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesperson explained that in the medium term, the group would have to bring together another 100 jobs scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive. Moreover, the Astro Park open area offices are better suited to the way employees work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location with a remarkable infrastructure for us."
He claims that connection to the airport is of great importance to a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region yesterday sparked the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again a "global actor" had been conquered.
It is a "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of establishment".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
Management informed the municipality of this intention very early.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our assistance to this company," said Mr Korwisi.
However, friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer vis-à-vis the owner of the Marienbader Place building.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of preventing such an exceptional place from remaining unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu and the nearby "small vertical", as well as the rest of the buildings of Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
As a result of a joint project by the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the railway station and the Town Hall. This was a source of criticism, not only because of the impressive layout of the areas that used to be used partly as parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment consulting company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer still associated with Siemens at the time, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German group in Frankfurt specializing in Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group is considered to be the third largest supplier of IT products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. Other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This old twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronics and Electrotechnical Industry.
Deportation of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing increasing difficulties.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has expelled the site dedicated to the disclosure of confidential documents from its servers.
This may hide political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
Wikileaks founder, Mr Assange, apparently lives in England.
In the United States, Wikileaks is being attacked with ever greater force.
The group of cyber-activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the prominent American Senator, Joe Lieberman, called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, probably lives in Britain, according to news reports published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom", said on Wednesday (local time) the cyber-activists behind the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Recently, the cyber company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach the largest number of accesses to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression is a problem for Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
CNN TV, citing Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation conducted by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The president of the Senate Commission for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier in view of previous Wikileaks publications of classified information," said the senator.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, monstrously and unscrupulously, thereby endangering our national security and endangering life around the world," according to an independent senator's statement.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the contents of stolen documents."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on Interpol's list of wanted persons.
According to information published by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described as intrigues orchestrated by his critics the prosecution of him by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson told London that threats have been made against the site.
"Calls were even made for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange fears especially for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly responded to the statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that those responsible for Wikileaks' revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Head of Government Advisor Stephen Harper stated on television, obviously ironically, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a drone".
Meanwhile, there was a controversy between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for US President Barack Obama, described as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr.Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and most recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we need to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the assertions of a website."
The U.S. government is now completely testing the protection of its databases.
According to a White House statement, Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Anti-Terrorism Centre, was appointed responsible for preventing leaks.
Mr Travers is responsible for implementing "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the whole administration exchanges and protects the information.
In addition, the US government announced that it wanted to deal with the security of dissidents and activists if ever they were threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesperson Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where's all the ice coming from?
Glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, the somewhat old-fashioned ice confectioner in German, manufactures cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window with a spatula, disposes it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, you don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice can't avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of sorbetières founded the University of Ice in 2003 so that the ice creams released from its machines meet all the high Italian ideals.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from around the world.
Special courses are also offered on chocolate ice cream, covering several days. Practical sessions are also organized in the private ice cream shop.
In the middle of the mid-life crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others risk simply fulfilling their burning desire on smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia and Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of art education from California, is a fan of Slow Food. He wants to offer a quality European product in the future in the country of Industrial Ice.
Anke from Berlin is an advisor in business management and after a few years she wants to draw something unique from this challenging job for her nerves.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian maid came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
Determinants not only good taste, but also silky suppleness and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation the icing on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, from the south: "The Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
It then opens a tap installed on the machine: a pasteurized basic white cream comes out of it, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately assailed with the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can the personal pleasure of experimentation be given free rein?
Mr Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
Those who speak only of ice creams "made from natural ingredients" may, however, have used stabilizers: most often a natural product, e.g. guar seed flour obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using stabilizers, only it has to be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will eat nothing but ice pellets.
Some changes in the base mass are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with aromas.
The master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that are acquired in the fruit or confectionery section of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"The suppliers will all try to give you dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in fruit sorbets recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it, becomes a yellow cream and, when added cocoa powder, constitutes the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must move on to the use of ice machines.
Luciano occasionally invites them to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice creams are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily have the nut's taste, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The very popular kiwi ice cream is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture is the taste of ice," says Luciano.
Ice making is a calculation exercise: if you use peach puree with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the winemakers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the calculations easier.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as in the past, so much physical intervention.
It is not only the machine that automatically manufactures the basic mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the available ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it unctuous and reduced to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, slight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo shuffles with fruit purée from head to toe and, thus, splashes his fellow students when control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that an "incident like this could happen during each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that is experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has kerneld the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the Testbiotech Panel, which is considered an independent institute for assessing the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," said Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, in Munich on Wednesday.
There is some information that the Chairman of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Mr Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi Pressure Group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in developing the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms of Mr. Then.
The requirements drawn up correspond verbatim, by sub-paragraphs, to the positions taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the mark of the industry which would basically be controlled by the authorities installed in Parma in Italy.
This is already the second time Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior Efsa official has recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period. In doing so, she has changed sides.
A short time ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicions from both the German Federal Environment Agency and MEPs.
However, Efsa does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
There is an opinion that all reliable data, including industry data, are being used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Efsa are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) based in the United States.
This organization sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together experts from science, industry and policy, among others, to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree with the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding tests and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the impact of genetically modified maize causes in the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If we don't look for the risks, how can we then discover them?" asks Mr. Then in an accusatory tone.
That is also Mrs Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been conducting research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region, as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
For this reason, there are hardly any researchers who are not related to companies.
In the view of companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms Hilbeck stated that "industry controls safety research".
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell bought it, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: By September, the excavators had come and started to demolish much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of the central station of Stuttgart into an underground station which will cost several billions.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations resulted in the stoppage of construction work.
Breaked into 6000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (coquillary limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement poorly constructed between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor residing in Ostfildern.
He got some fragments of it.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He declared enthusiastically: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He claims that by cutting it at the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he'll do with this fragment yet.
Rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
traces of Stuttgart stones lead to a former ammunition depot of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappeared in the landfill," he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He says he was insulted and threatened when the newspapers reported in September that he had purchased the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he told them he couldn't do anything to stop the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to keep using the stones.
Some 200 opponents of the S21 project later won one of the stone parallelepiped weighing an average of 80 kilos, the value of which is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir in while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half is still piled up in the forest, the rest having long been sold.
Owners of gardens, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came from everywhere and took away everything that could fit into the trunk and trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or as limitations of grass beds.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"has not been this political component."
He enters his all-terrain car, walks around his vast 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and later began studying biology before becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a carrier.
And a stone lover.
It stores 40,000 tons.
It gathers treasures everywhere in Germany.
He claims that he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's repressing.
Artfully carved sandstones are laid on the snow.
"Once upon a time, they were part of the bridge of Marienbrücke in Dresden".
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, says enthusiastically.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
It shows a heap of the finger: Red sandstone, formerly, part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And so on.
"Joli travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Throughout the snow of the stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from the cathedral of St Blasien, the tuff from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thought that once the stones were carved by hand and moved with simple hoists and carts drawn by oxen, he became completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were to be cut apart."
He didn't get rich, let alone rich.
But today this carrier employs 14 people. In addition, stone tailors, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's rewarding," says the waste recycler.
Soon he's due to go to Cologne.
There, too, there are stones to save.
Fighting Talent to Conquer High Potentials
There's a lot of traffic in the counter.
16 students rush to buy salmon loaves, tomato sauce and whites.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the automotive manufacturer Volkswagen invited design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
In a kind of competition of ideas, they have to talk business about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen firm.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body to body in the competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most gifted graduates as far as possible in the amphitheatre before they enter the labour market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify outstanding talents in practical projects and retain them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automotive group embraces the talents.
A young lady from the staff department shares pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs for young talent; she shows them the paths to reach the group's premises.
Nico Selle of the Braunschweig Technical University is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, it can know the students, look more closely at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play as a collaborator."
According to Mr. saddle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive we're trying to attract students.
"In other cases, the emphasis was on the professional project," said Mr. Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much tougher.
In many sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting on a pool of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and above all court the highly skilled workforce.
It is mainly graduates from engineering disciplines who find themselves in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineering association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the VDI's forecasts, the gap in engineering positions will widen further.
Roman Dykta goes on talent hunting for KPMG, an audit firm, accounting and consulting firm.
It organises expensive events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel through the United States in this way.
Participants can also visit KPMG's subsidiaries and know the company.
The person who must participate in the selection process decides in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to search for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little."
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the count seems to be there.
"Until today, we have been in contact with all the people who took part last year in a similar action."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to address their requests to our company soon," he says.
Apart from the direct crowding done on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are proceeding in a very classic way by participating in professional fairs where they engage in brain-hunting.
"We try to reach the graduates by participating in trade shows."
"For example, at the Solar Technology Fair," says Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The company based in Bonn employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Ms Stübe is aware of the problem of succession.
Currently, 35 positions are put to the competition on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It's expensive and takes a lot of time," he says.
Another way to make contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Freiburg.
"Professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to undertake professional internships or to write his or her completion project at home."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often a large group can't do that," says Staff Chief Stübe.
Money has long failed to play the leading role in job search.
Other factors are flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honour table for German employers.
To this end, it asks employees about their level of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the framework conditions of employees.
The Head of Staff Ms Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the image of society among job seekers.
"I think that candidates rely mainly on external assessments for a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employee Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means, above all, taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to make himself attractive is through his own employees," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, that is, the creation of the employer's brand within its own workforce.
"satisfied collaborators are the best messengers."
When their employees are treated well and identified with the company, they themselves advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," says Kriegler.
Obama Impedes New Oil Drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, a state in the southeastern United States, in the years to come.
The Washington government has imposed a ban An equivalent ban and thus definitively cancels its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the time being.
Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform that is behind this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of this accident, which cost the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated his willingness to allow further drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who bears the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in golf is not, until now, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is faced with billions of claims, is at the centre of the charges.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar lifted the drilling freeze decreed after the explosion of the platform.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing extensive reform.
At the same time, Obama announced that they would remove the lucrative tax niches of gas and oil groups.
Stakeholders in this industry are now publicly warning that the flow rate in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's objective is to curb the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector" according to the results of a current survey conducted in the sector by the BDO audit firm, before the drilling ban issued on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows what will change exactly with the regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing through the rivers is oiled brown; it emits a smell similar to that which exists in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live on theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't wear yourself out," the environmental activist said to journalists to calm them down: "You still today have enough oil mud in front of the water lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man in the muddy water to the chest, as well as the fat trail around him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the glow of water in the color of the rainbow.
It cannot be seen that the basement is full of brown tablescloths of crude oil.
On the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells us that she used to collect shrimp in whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil came out of an oil pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the neighbouring small town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The full extent of the ravages is evident when the mangrove marshes crossed by streams are traversed.
Instead of a clear water, the motorboat splits a crading brown water. Anyone who dips his hand removes it all covered with oil.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the soil like licorice sticks. Isolated palms sadly hang their palms.
We seek in vain the clouds of birds, as we usually encounter in the wetlands: As soon as the outboard motor stops, a ghostly silence falls on this paradise of old that looks like a gas station by the smell it emits.
"What is happening here is war on the environment," says Celestine Akpobari with a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The area where the Ogoni lived has been under siege for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. The latter was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to interrupt its production activities in this area because they had become very dangerous to its employees.
Even today, the return to Ogoni is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines in the entire Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of Ogoni country are unexploited, because the situation there is too unstable for this oil group.
Every few hundred meters rise in the water of steel tretals like strange sculptures: We refer very affectionately to "Christmas trees" the heads of boreholes.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are rusted to the marker.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time in pieces, as a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts' estimates, over two billion litres have been spilled into the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to the oil that passed into the sea during the accident of the super-oil tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the largest environmental catastrophes in human history.
Who should bear responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides actors.
For the Shell Group, the sabotage and siphoning of oil pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider the explosions of drilling heads and perforated oil pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner criticized the Shell Group for applying essentially less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of pipeline failures is "still much higher than the level of the pipes".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, resembles an abandoned workshop, full of junk and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with junk to the neck.
A fire sparkles under one of the many barrels that sometimes connect to the pipes, sometimes scattered without motif on the site must be repeated: a small underground refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
Initially, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then at the end of the kerosene drop pipe, and diesel is finally obtained.
For example, Michael and his four employees produce four 300-litre diesel barrels every day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
Delta residents benefit from the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a lower price than the ridiculously low price of barely 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: because they acquire their raw material free of charge.
It is offered by the "protectors" who are drilling the pipeline network throughout the Ogoni country. According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small, insignificant part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include high-ranking politicians and military members, charge the lion's share in tankers and hold it on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers that the debate on whether to attribute environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or to the lax mode of production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and the foundations of fishermen's lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no illegal sabotage, theft and refineries."
But, in the meantime, the Ogoni's relations especially with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was only about the withdrawal of the group. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, like the Chinese, will prove better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you got out of here," says the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers, mostly from the north of the country, want to enjoy raw materials like all Nigerians.
"In any case, this damn thing has brought down our country very low," regrets Akpori.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major safety problem.
When examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The airline Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the Quantas company had so far been more fortunate: In the course of its investigation, the Australian Aviation Safety Authority found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft presented a serious safety problem and warned against a possible construction defect.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks at the connection of the oil line, is indicated in a position paper published this Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of reactors".
This applies to the Rolls-Royce reactors manufactured and equipped with 20 A380 series aircraft.
The Quantas company's Airbus, which had to land urgently on 4 November in Singapore, is among these.
The Australian airline has now brought legal action against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take further legal action against society.
Quantas's director, Alan Joyce, stated that his company would claim damages in respect of the incident at the beginning of November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, oil inflammation is the cause of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced around the world.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos which are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The safety issue is considered to be of sufficient importance to inform all parties concerned.
After the aircraft's emergency landing, the Quantas airline had grounded its entire A380 fleet for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily stopped three of its eleven A380 aircraft.
Lufthansa Company replaced, as a precautionary measure, the A380 reactor.
The two-stage aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall all over the country causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, the snow fell on almost the whole country.
There is chaos on all roads, trains and planes.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany throttle: By freezing temperatures, almost the whole republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimetres in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On National A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff worked on a permanent basis, but they were unable to cope with the snow that was constantly accumulating.
In addition, violent gusts swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Marine Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal waves to occur on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow piles on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the weather alert center Meteomedia announced the purple alert level was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it's the highest level.
In places, it fell 30 centimetres of fresh snow that the strong and cool winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars remained stuck there at night.
Even in the Land of Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities have announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused traffic to stop and traffic to stop.
In Thuringia, snowfall hit highways A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions in rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, trees fallen on railway tracks, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, the inter-regional Leipzig-Nuremberg transport had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train with blankets, food and beverages.
Snow winds swept the roads.
Snowfalls have led to numerous flight cancellations at Germany's main airports.
According to a spokesperson for the standard and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesperson for Fraport indicated that 40 flights had already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that there are no more passengers stranded at the airport, despite which only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit at a crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car rolled on a slippery roadway in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: Snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will swirl in case of slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by strong and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, up to less than 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to news reports, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could bring in up to 500 million euros.
The Deutsche Bank has just embellished the headquarters of the group: The twin towers located in the Business Quarter have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers had to return to their former place of duty.
From now on, the financial group is obviously seeking to recover the renovation costs and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" has written, citing a spokesperson.
This spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we check whether it's more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or sell them, and to lease them again later."
Thus, Germany's largest financial institution has already ceded its seat shortly thereafter.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for an amount of €272 million from the equity holders and then rehabilitated them.
The transformations aimed at energy optimisation have swallowed up, according to some indications, about 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector estimate the value of the towers, which have since been renamed "Green Towers", at around 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesperson, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the miners who have perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of buried miners who were reported dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
The bodies had not yet been able to be recovered because the safety situation of the damaged well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the disaster well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
As a result of the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue team was able to enter the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that minors no longer had any chance of surviving.
So far the bodies could not be reassembled.
Today, parents and friends organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people gathered under a bright sun in Greymouth south of New Zealand Island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried miners, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal belongings, including clothes and surfboards, were also included.
The flags were half-masted in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants at the commemorative party that New Zealand has nurtured the hope that miners will return to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the pits said that he could not resign himself to accepting the death of his son until he saw his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
First aid workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police Commissioner Gary Knowles told reporters that when explosive gas masses are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the film Splatter an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old genre thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising", epic of the fighter.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal murder methods. When he is in a bad mood, he rips out the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to be dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the blind man does not say a word about his real name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, from the detour of one or two sentences some appalling cries of agony.
Otherwise, we say nothing and celebrate in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the setting of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travel.
When a film targets more than one target group, it is a pity that the target groups are mutually exclusive.
Since the release of "Pusher", the director Winding Refn has been considered a sort of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, his trilogy about the fierce and styled drug dealer, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to the art and essay cinema.
Most art movie sympathizers must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and the intestines.
The amateurs of action films die of boredom, when the blind man embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any distributor of films in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that have earned some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not about dialogues in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
The viewer can't escape it.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with icy images and a gloomy soundtrack, but above all with an elusive hatred that springs from the heart of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully alongside the blind, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the blind hero whose motives are never known, but who comes back from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by transforming himself into a warrior, is perhaps sent by the devil himself.
It represents rot, but perhaps also, just for those who are, in any case, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, whose purpose is annoyance, enthusiasm and amazement.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications concerning a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, let alone submit to the Agency's controls.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007, around midnight, at least four F-15 I Israeli fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the river bank of the Euphrates; the largest town nearby is 30 kilometres away: it is Dair as-sur.
Its name appears in IAEA documents, because it refers to the reactor that Syria has apparently built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepipede, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a briefing from the United States intelligence services, the CIA, dating back to the end of April 2008, is well-suited to producing plutonium for the production of atomic weapons by the current reactor, known as the nearby town of al-Kibar.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video with fuzzy satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each reactor component prior to the destruction of the plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even the interior of it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be commissioned, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is hardly any more information than at the time, and even with time the mystery is getting thicker and thicker.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was certainly sure that Syria had built a reactor in al-Kibar, but had little evidence showing that country was developing "an active nuclear weapons program".
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and only talk about a "presumptive reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation to be "plausible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how he made sure that he was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior diplomat from the United Nations gave only a laconic response in the summer, claiming that the IAEA had "documents sufficient to ask questions".
The Syrians have certainly hurriedly removed the rubble of the "unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical smoothing of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium in al-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images from commercial service providers through a Member State showing the moment that directly followed the attack, which appears to be more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret atomic programme and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found on the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after particle analysis, calling it implausible.
Since then, damas has refused to discuss this, as well as satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and refuses access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel remains stubbornly silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
For example, the investigation of this case has been slow since June 2008 without a result being achieved and is "increasingly transforming itself into a serious problem of the Agency's credibility", as recognized by a high-ranking Western diplomat serving at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, which is ultimately a serious violation of the Nuclear Weapons Ban Treaty.
The IAEA considers that progress must be made by clarifying the existence of the other three facilities that must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities they are dealing with here, what their function is or what they are suspected of being contained.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also by the names of neighbouring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C., identified these localities and discovered a complex near Masyaf on satellite images, which would most likely be one of the suspected objects.
It is possible that it is located in or directly adjacent to a military base; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is alleged that Syrians fear that the inspection group will actually be spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on military installations.
Indeed, it is intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that attracts the attention of nuclear inspectors.
IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have shuttled between the three sites and the stone parallelepipede to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat stated in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could be "used for fuel production".
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities", such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are indispensable for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible assumptions as to where uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed for the bomb would have been separated later.
It is not known whether the rubble, which could hide traces of high value, was stored at all three sites.
Once the hundreds of trucks loaded with land have disappeared, no one will have information on the place of storage of the rubble.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the salt mine at al-Tibni, located only a few kilometres from al-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River, examined in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
Recent analysis of satellite photographs for the famous Jane's Intelligence Review, the former IAEA inspector, Mr. Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Satellite photographs show, however, that Syria undertook earth-moving work at the three suspect sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began to demand access to those locations.
It may be a coincidence, but it did not help to rule out suspicions.
In the diplomatic circles, he said that the IAEA had spent several months preparing a plan for inspections to be carried out there, which was intended to enable Syria to preserve any military secrets, and only the time invested showed how much interest the inspectors had in this matter.
Meanwhile, Damascus also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported in this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the ambassador of the United States who has been talking for a few months about what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means at the disposal of the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The IAEA Director, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has certainly already talked about "an option that I am open to in the future", but he is still hesitant.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented in the Board have no desire to see the situation escalate.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives to reflect: "To this it would be useful, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in Time of War
It's been bad since Angelina Jolie made her summer debut as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything more about this story, but it's enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumour indicates that the Muslim woman fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the Yugoslavian war.
Bosniak women's federations immediately protested. In response, some film footage planned in Sarajevo was moved in the last minute to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the Women Victims of War organization sent correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet with the actress. Jolie herself is a goodwill ambassador to UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she offered these women a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting is to be held in Bosnia," Hasecic says.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says a lot about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights withdraw the status of Goodwill Ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, by the way, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
After some hesitation, the Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, granted permission to shoot in Sarajevo, but it is not known why it did not come in spite of that permission.
The young author assures herself that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a great deal of effort that she has become aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She maintains that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give all the parties taking part the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: Lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. It meets again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
This is still a big difference with the version "a rape victim loves her executioner".
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, as Jolie says, is "unjust and based on erronized information".
From now on, only Hollywood fanatics can give him peace: By illegally putting this scenario on the Net, like many others before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, everything is going well again among the Irish.
No sign of consternation.
This is why the local team overly dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout with joy against a background of strong music, they trip their feet.
Cork's Baileyu-Pub in South Irish vibrates because players launch and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in beer cups of the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong". The winner picks up 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to attend in January in Las Vegas at the world beer-pong championship.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the dark question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will conduct job interviews in New Zealand.
"I have a strange feeling," he says.
"The country of birth is so far away and I don't have a job."
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as event manager, perhaps a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Due to the bleak outlook in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, and her brother Colin is now a computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even expect 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are made, it will be a pattern of emigration comparable to that of which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish enjoyed a great deal of ease, grief is now taking its place.
The economic crisis, however, affects mainly the well-trained young Irish who have so far had only moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social loss seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's money in excess.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times publishes extensively the letters from readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes adrift."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the possibilities, goes away and our country thus a whole generation."
"The last one to leave the light off."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future coming because the government is just throwing powder in the eye and offers young people no prospect of the future.
"They reduce the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades cling from one unpaid practical internship to another.
She says that her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to address this theme positively.
McLarnon organises the "WorkingAbroadExpo" fair, which offers full support on the theme "Working Abroad".
"But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," says the manager.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a waste, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was nothing more to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector and Germany.
A fashion house just came out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional workstation, in order to be able to complete the repayment of the credit contracted to build his home in the home country.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, crossing the threshold of his home for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I hardly live anymore."
He bursts with an embarrassing laugh as he walks through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars from large brands are parked on access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, 100 percent financed by credit.
"These were moments of madness, without a doubt, money was easy," he says.
Is he afraid that everything will collapse because of credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, tightens hot tea and says: "I have no children to maintain and I am young; even everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The building engineer doesn't like the lamentations he's been hearing lately.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe that's what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and in Ireland life continued, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let the future and discover how life goes elsewhere.
In his list, He already has a few years of work in London. That’s why life shouldn’t be as easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that worries him well in recent days: the party to be organised on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid she won't be able to turn into a farewell party.
"Only, not a lot of emotion," he said, drinking a long sip of beer.
"A good-bye is still a matter of concern."
"Let's call it a good-bye night, all relaxed, gathering some friends, some drinks and some games."
Democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro survey in 18 countries published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it tracks changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is Latin America's rather sunny mood.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after experiencing a sharp fall in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same number as last year but with a sharp increase of 25% in 2001 (Chart 3).
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but up sharply from 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shook support for democracy.
If this has kept going during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have suffered only a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and decreased again this year to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see Chart 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say that they or someone close to them have been victims of a crime in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela agree (and 80% support the private enterprise); although their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private enterprises.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, reported by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country that was devastated and plunged into fear.
Poll boxes and a new ballot were presented, ballots were scattered throughout the gutter, polling stations were ransacked and intimidation was reported.
The polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced as a result of the January earthquake, were wandering around to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favourites, denounced the fraud and called for the annulment of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, considers the event to be "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they "did not believe that these irregularities, however serious they may be, had necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared invalid.
But there may be problems if Mr.Célestin, who has little or no visible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second round, reaches the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, there was concern that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, necessary for voting, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are important.
Donors see the election of a legitimate people's government as an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And so, it's clear, Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
The weeks after suddenly becoming a widow, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, received a wave of sympathy from the public which improved her approval rate by 20 points, to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Mrs Fernández, apparently in mourning, according to which she would abandon or not the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional revenues at will.
Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation sank into disarray following the death of Mr.Kirchner of a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian hit one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to fight," the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be applied next year, leaving the President even more room to spend at will.
The economy is overheating widely: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and union wage claims, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, he harassed the private sector and purged INDAC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by high world prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded growth as a result of a strong devaluation in 2002.
That is perhaps why Mrs Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the government entered into an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its maturities in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be developing towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve surveillance by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index; which looks like a prelude to the consolidation of INDAC.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer at her side.
If she does, she needs to gain support from the middle class, among whom Kirchnerism is highly advocated.
When the Argentines returned from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for it will have reflued.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether to repudiate many of her husband’s policies quietly.
Half a hurrah for China
Taiwanese voters are moving towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its older brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters ran on November 27th, 70% of eligible people, to elect mayors and municipal councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings about the continent, having forged innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the greatest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just fine.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mayors, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (DPP), which leaned towards Taiwan's full independence, won nearly 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including dirty country trucks and mass gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal dress.
A mandatory mysterious assassination attempt was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, Honorary President of the KMT, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien, purely through his face, wounding him and killing a passer-by.
Oddly enough, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences for the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Maybe the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking that the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates have been involved in plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP has also refrained from fuelling anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a renewed awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation as to whether his Chinese policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back to the fold.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let's start at the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, he was ill: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on charges of corruption.
From 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates was born under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is doing everything possible to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party presents a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that the PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, it will be difficult for the DPP to choose between its potential candidates.
The KMT has to do a self-introspection.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite staggering economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A spokesperson for the KMT said that his office and its local branches would be reorganized.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Awards nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to read it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer picked up by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises of this year's Grammy Awards with a major nomination in the "Best New Artist" category.
Considering that Spalding has been a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the Grammy Award rules according to which an artist must not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skillful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line at Spalding compared to Norah Jones' fulgurant success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Award voters by taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy Award voters have rightly honoured Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "instrumental album" category, a twist on an invigorating thrill of a recording that was one of the top favorites last year.
Among these Iyers, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positotly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a favourite in New Orleans' raucous voice and frequent guest at HBO's "Treme", has been honoured in the contemporary jazz category; who also strongly leans towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, won some well-deserved recognitions in the big category together; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his byte's live was a fine example of the democratic hand of this bassist as group leader.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classical nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
Leading nominations include Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No.4, "Los Angeles", a work commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also in competition for a prize.
The classical appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, operal, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - l'art des Catrati" featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the category of opera, the nominees are Berg's "Lulu" from the Royal Opera House Orchestra, Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from the Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "Lounge de Loin" from the Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the Orchestre and Choir from the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition include Pärt for Symphonie n°4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No.4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's Mandolin Concerto was nominated for his instrumental solo performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he wrote the 15-minute work especially for the performer at the Avi Avital mandolin, which performed the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of ranges and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez received a nomination in the category of orchestra performances, for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received a nomination were pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalist-solist nominees: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixtures, soprano Jessye Norman received an appointment for her recording "Racines: ma vie, ma chanson"
The Temecula Mosque project is approved by the Planning Commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics attacked the project claiming that it promoted both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you mention it," said Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Centre, speaking on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it, as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, for the most part, people speaking for or against the centre, at roughly the same time, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America fell."
The planned Islamic centres have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including the Ground Zero, where the attacks of 11 September 2001 took place in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 families co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a property shared with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24.943 square foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and would be 43 feet high.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
An arsenic tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organization has a dual capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why she's very special, even though she's far from being a truly "foreign" life form," commented Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacterium, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We wonder what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
Discovery is important in the search for life beyond the Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report might disclose the discovery of an alien life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms may be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute for Planetary and Spatial Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element for another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to substitute for each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behaviour is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms find it difficult to distinguish these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and, in a way, erases the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
Researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing levels of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea, that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new; but nothing has ever shown that this could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of the Earth's existence, she says, so researchers hypothesized that early life forms could have used it.
This suggests that there may be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at first," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs were found in Compton
The other two show dogs out of four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, as the Los Angeles County sheriffs announced on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two akitas and two Welsh Pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower motel 6, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday evening, told Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is dogs are fine," Whitmore says.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in what area and the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
Dog owners Kristina Rickard and David Peek could not be contacted to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were safe and sound, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of Japanese dog owners, were missing until their discovery on Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the National Championate "AKC/Eukanuba" in Long Beach, where they planned to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the couple's dog show tour of almost a month.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked the motel.
They often stay in the motels and park their van outside, right next to their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell burrow and a Breton spaniel - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so that the dogs could have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen at 6:00 on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM only awaits the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York, on Thursday officially praised the plan "pre-packaged" by creditors that about $5 billion of the debt would be erased; paving the way for the entertainment company, having 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With Thursday's decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no legal obstacles remain before MGM to recover under the tutelage of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become general directors of what will be a light studio.
Staff will be reduced to approximately 320 out of 400 on departure.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase enters into a $500 million credit facility to finance new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which is itself facing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio restructuring process began in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. investment bank was hired to advise management on how to invest its finances as it could not afford to pay interest amounting to $300 million per year.
In August, Executive Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron and an expert in recovery known for his work at Krispy Krame Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the studio's more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the additional $2 billion that creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again as the MGM team began to work on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially emerged from bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper received multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which raised $375,000 per month for their corporate management services, will receive a "success premium" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum intend to relaunch MGM's production, which has released only one film this year, and develop an annual list of seven or eight films that will be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must enter into a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM's debt, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech Toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful toy is the IPAD, followed perhaps by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make a significant breach in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad, you can buy five $99 BMX bikes and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic beads jump strings, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technological toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best known of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the button battery toys are increasing, as well as the rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are plush toys the size of an Indian pig that sing a note when you squeeze them on their belly.
One pressure is equal to one note, and a second one allows you to compose a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start pressing, you can't stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays games in turn like Simon Says and can do the moon dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will remember Alphia, one of the first computer-based educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a backpack filled with quiz cards designed to turn a ride into a session with a self-correction and valve binder.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three stand-alone alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 year olds) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 year olds), this is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a more recent and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
The Fisher-Price iXL ($90, for 3 to 7 year olds) uses an iTunes-type system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card entry that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8+ years) is a set of just five blocks larger than a match box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing blocks online before time runs out, it's ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
More and more, toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in the toy shops, the two largest ones are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6 to 12 year olds) that includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you redeem the online code, your child receives enough credit at Club Penguin store for two elective items.
These can be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the tip of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the latest button stack micro-robot.
The false bug moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pasta in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It's also strong.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage through our dog's mouth.
Bringing a softer side to the maintenance of order in China
Tang Shenbin was surveying a square in the city as an urban sergeant to training by severely inspecting his nervous charges, issuing low-voice orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan - imposing officials of public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and their inclination for violence - to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"Stay straight!"
"Be piercing!"
Show them, he said, "What do pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely spent their teens in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-coloured jackets and trousers, were frozen at the attention of you.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned to the ruler.
Four neat hats perfectly perched on top of hair attached by a blue and white striped knot.
"Personally, I think they look average," said Mr. Tang, disdainfully.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a higher degree.
Guangdong Province traded grey-green uniforms for a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced them with the sharp way: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black glances, firmly for half an hour, until the hawker packed up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to do a major image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its urban street police force with 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, shape and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have trouble getting a look at this underground urban brigade of China.
And for good reason, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media portray the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei province beat an observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors in Beijing, stolen and posted online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without emitting blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon hawker was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained in assaulting street vendors.
"Chengguan marked the government," deplored last year China Daily, a national publication, after an umpteenth controversy on tactics.
The newspaper called for a "real complete clean-up."
Skeptics say that the approach is far away.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had any real jobs or whether they were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district's announcement required female candidates, between 18 and 22 years old, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five facial features in the right order."
They must have a larger than average size of 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
The officers stated that the work was physically too painful for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are appropriate; these are height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities."
Chengguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not agree with this description.
But he noted that the height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement for the order of facial features.
That it means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
It is true that disabled or disfigured persons must not apply.
"We can't let a lame person or a hunchback come and serve here," says Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrolling Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the presentation of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked in disillusioned air.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old dimples colleague, says: "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They did not object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they had greater career ambitions than simply chasing sellers into the alleys where they were supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen street vendors who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many breads or bowls of tofu as possible before fleeing.
Master Wang, you have to leave.
"We have already told you several times!", said Mrs. Xu while a salesman fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle cart bike.
Agents describe their duties as monotonous rather than hard.
"It's about the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the sellers' goods.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rebelled after false rumours were spread that the chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen chengguan policemen and agents were injured, 14 government vehicles were hit or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from placid Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
The officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the bike was shouting at the scandal.
A 15-minute arm iron followed before the police, with a sinister face, crossed their way to their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, her white badge returned to hide her name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men 40 years of age or older - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxy image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Li says in a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the audience that starts."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
The Department of Justice prosecutors lifted the criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, arising from a case involving an assistant from an old campaign and his efforts to obtain lobbying work for the wife's husband, announced the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr.Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal around his case made the national headlines last year and harmed his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" by the decision, the result of a one-year investigation.
The honourable senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Counsel for Mr.Ensign stated that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer under investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this matter."
The Department of Justice has refrained from commenting on this matter.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, according to which there was significant evidence that Mr. Ensign had conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr.Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative lobbying to win the silence of Mr.Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as treasurer in an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; according to the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator with Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for one year by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
The ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to be in contradiction with the so-called ban on the rotating door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that was made public, "there appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and substantial violation of the revolving door law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of a government investigation.
Although the judge of the department refused to explain the reasoning that led to the Ensign decision, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department appeared to be wary of political prosecution after a number of high-level setbacks from its Public Integrity Section, including last year's decision to drop the prosecution of former Senator Ted Stevens for lack of prosecution.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms," said Melanie Sloan, Director General of Citizens for Accountability and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's senior counsel, stated in an interview that on Monday he had received a telephone call from a Department of Justice prosecutor and a follow-up the following day, telling him that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr.Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed on Wednesday in a press release, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the Public Prosecutor's Office.
"I'm not comfortable getting into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we think they've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that Mr. Ensign's payment of $96,000 by his parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The electoral commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a significant Nevada company that has long supported the honourable senator, is a company for which Mr.Ensign helped Mr.Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "walking" the Ministry of the Interior on an issue in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to schedule a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as the fourth-ranked Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for several months, Mr.Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr.Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, said that the honourable senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and end his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were typing away in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent every minute reports of horrible testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defence said that there were more than 140,000 messages about the trial of the rape case and the children attached to their bed in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already submitted evidence to the court that outlines appeal arguments, which may be occupying the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reports on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - have created a "cirque atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury has been poorly influenced by the public's passions.
The request could lead appeal judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experienced this in this trial; I believe that there is a real danger that the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms violates the human rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the State Superior Court, laconically rejected the claims in last week's judgment, claiming that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
Appeal courts have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 judgement, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a osteopath from Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his decision that there was a "carnaval atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
Crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have stated that appeal courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules may be necessary to manage the communications media in the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report according to which it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue argues that some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is but one of many described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, which can be discussed for years; this delays execution.
Defence counsel also argued, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered harm when Blue J. refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photographs of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, age 48, and her daughters, Hayley, age 17, and Michaela, age 11.
Defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of the prosecutors, and that he improperly put pressure on a verdict by taking the unusual decision to get the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, tabled last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was being discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for governorship and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media constantly stirred the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily rush of media tweets, cameras and journalists outside the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "did not look like anything that had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally."
Their focus on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion that instant news was more incendiary than the press releases delivered more slowly was a luddist view that would impoverish the Court's policy governing media coverage of future trials.
However, some lawyers stated that appeal courts were often attracted by arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their file, they refer to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial, and they stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
"This case," they wrote, represents the case of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century. "
Can civility bring the cleavages closer together?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a forerunner of genuine bipartite cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and Congress leaders produced no breakthroughs on the major issues to be addressed during the "Luck Duck" session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides as well as about the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
Wednesday's public meeting of the committee on the president's deficit was just as civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological divide; but that, however, still divides the members.
This is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a period of trial and mutual testing to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
That is why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too profound to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxation, spending, health care or rights, both parties stay miles away.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now alongside the Centre for Ethical and Public Policy.
"It's inevitable after the election.
The elections spark partisan passions and then fade away.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the "Luck Duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of them, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise can be envisaged on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, there was more optimism about a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on "the lame duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warned that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "lame duck" session would not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th congress would meet in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
"Once the things that have to be done are done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared scepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what is going on between today and 2012 as a pre-spectacle or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present at the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, pushing the retirement age and reducing spending.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their view, imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have struggled to reach that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected representatives; this suggests that there is little reason or willingness to compromise on tax issues, at least today.
Galston plans two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan confrontations, as Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care; and then be followed by a period of greater bipartite cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will observe the reaction of the public carefully.
He who is judged to be in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would nevertheless be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a larger election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exhibited this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But much more effort will be required on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
American documents leaked describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and passes through the Kremlin some of the bribes and protection money it collects, the US Embassy in Russia reported in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service carry out huge racketes that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of power" - is taking its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but there has been little clean-up since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the accusations of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation lawsuits on these charges.
In September, he told a Russian television channel when he was questioned about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's to throw away, it's anything."
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy report; and it is unheard of that it would be up to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow City government and crime has led some people to name it "dysfunctional" and to assert that the government functioned more like a kleptocracy than a government," according to the embassy's note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means "roof" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through all the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts to identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a void in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB is brewing money from the largest companies and that the police are targeting the smaller ones.
One source, he said, "explained that business owners in Moscow understood that it was better to get protection from MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high."
The note notes that although the collection of money is extensive, protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has mentioned the fight against corruption several times, but he has admitted that little progress has been made.
The note from the embassy transmits reports of men bringing suitcases, probably full of money, to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview with Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank Indem" in Moscow.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"He is not part of a political class because there is no political class in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to Indiam, the cost of corruption is estimated to be more than $300 billion a year across Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the note of the American embassy, which was only carried out yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will stir with certainty discontents within the Russian government; although Lujkov can be blamed, to some extent, for the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is solving the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that WikiLeaks' documents could be a fabrication and reacted with anger to the statements that US diplomats had leaked by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem lies in the fact that this is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he says.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that it would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, as you know, in opposition to ethics."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with poor quality decrepit concrete walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School mentioned the man who built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge in north-west Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum enabled victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly run with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence concerning a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing, to 35 years in prison, the former head of Tuol Sleng's notorious torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
In the face of these developments, anxiety has increased among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There are resentments and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowed Pol Pot's government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurgency that lasted until the last of the movements came in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrillas from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a United Nations-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, major groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defectionize the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending his trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge veterans have sunk into black poverty, common to the rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic to the movement.
Although some Khmer Rouge elite officers retained their positions as local leaders in exchange for laying down their arms, they are low-grade, unskilled farmers.
"These people received very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbued with the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"They were raised in a framework where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to provide for ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Court has also caused concern here.
The court is expected to start the trial at the beginning of next year with Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer red minister.
The court's mandate is to try senior leaders and key perpetrators of crimes, but it did not say whether it was continuing beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation turned to Im Chaem, 64 years old, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers were reportedly killed.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from work to the field near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court called her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said.
"If there is more prosecution, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defectioned the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, of the documentation centre.
"The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect broken pieces," he said.
"We have to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first manual approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history textbooks of the Ministry of Education, designed for higher schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They're suspicious because they don't know exactly how many people the court will go after."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful atrait here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a path, invaded by weeds and dotted with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusted sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31-year-old mobile phone salesman on the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and, later that day, she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its military-grade uranium stock
The government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material around the world
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the margins of a security summit.
The US government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But US officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarus research centre.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to one official who referred to the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized on the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it has been beneficial to provide an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves to me that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton described the agreement as a "very significant, important step" made by Belarus.
Obama committed in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military grade uranium and low enriched uranium," said Mr Lukashenko.
"It's our product... we're not gonna make dirty bombs, and we're not gonna sell it to anyone."
"We're just going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus moved closer to the United States a few months ago; however, by showing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the equipment had been slightly irradiated, said officials.
It was loaded on a special train that travelled more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and disposed of, said officials.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by air, according to officials.
The US government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus's research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"Comprehensive coordination and organization have been implemented to build confidence", leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, head of the Energy Department specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates by the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of kilos of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint declaration.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential to improving bilateral relations and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has not raised any objections to CIA flights
The government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo across Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the United States ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the daily El País, who add that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they were exercising adequate vigilance on foreign planes that were passing through Spain".
In June 2006, after a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, a meeting was held between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had surprised the Zapatero Government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega pointed out that Spain has no objection to the theft of intelligence over Spanish territory."
"They only want to be informed" to prevent them from being "taken off guard," Aguirre relates in a cable.
Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at that time, told the Ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even though, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
In turn, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless shown its concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of CNI o of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between the independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maneuver the case discreetly between the Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, during a luncheon between the ambassador of the United States and the Minister of Internal Affairs, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "so that they avoid the comments of an inflamed rhetoric, trying to reduce the temperature".
The Ambassador also expresses his concern for the PP's action in this matter.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even though these revelations have negative consequences for the United States Government," she says.
The parricide that passed to the confession complained in network of the "accident" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Galician error"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname that she used as soon as she was small, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; the two natives of Noia, the village of La Coruña from which she originated.
Messages are from 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of his parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Soon after they broke up, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
We found another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The chosen was Alberto, a young man of Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
With him, she lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labour market, the boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But according to the content of his communications, we hear that their idyll fractured, they separated.
In March of 2008 she is in Minorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and offended for the fact that I came to work there."
"When I told him, it seemed a good thing to him, but of course he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not to have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she talks about a mobile message she just got: "I want you to come home this month or you give me an address to send the child to you."
Ella complains: "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home," she claims.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'll only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to report to a job in order not to lose it".
She explains that if everything was okay, she would have taken her elder with her.
"He will remain with the correct person, i.e. with me, and I will never leave him with another person in my life if that person is not my mother", doubtful intention, taking into account their bad relations.
In July, there's another post.
When she hits him, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and he had allegedly been murdered on the 10th, died.
"Cesar's happy on one side, but he's not happy on another."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes this place a little, but on the other hand he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Majorca.
"He will go there (the child) a few hours in summer and so I save a little money from the babysitter."
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to the email, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is good, and goes to the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money".
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of hers in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Galician error (epigrapher)".
The last man who lived with her, guard, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything had gone so that she hadn't told him that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered Palma Provincial Prison yesterday, from the Judicial Detainees Centre in Minorca.
The ex officio lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the facts happened, "and she also had no intention of hurting the minor."
Before she confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and dropping her corpse in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric trial.
The members of the Popular Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9 seats.
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the muncipes of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the large increase in votes and deputies recorded in the last autonomic elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this group obtains in these comices normally doubles the one it receives in the Catalans.
For example, the Catalan popular won 610.473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomics they obtained 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384.091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, which is intended to result in the diversion of votes from the PSC and the retention of the PP electorate, analysts in this group have calculated that, if there are general elections, the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also gain four (it now has 10) and PSC would lose neither more nor less than 9 MPs (it has 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - he has three now - while ICV would keep one MP or win one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for the municipal committees, where the people can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and popular people agree that PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would no longer get the majority to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fanciful for this group to lose its representation in Barcelona City Hall - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they governed with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, they met several times.
People have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels and Reus.
Now the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerien detained by agents of the Barcelona Police General Information Commissariat formed a jihadist cell which, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including "Tigers for the Liberation of the Land Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last of which was the perpetrator of the Bombay attacks which caused the deaths of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" "was debilitated" Al Qaeda's falsification apparatus at the international level and "therefore, its operational capacity".
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrated the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" could cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only one that the jihadist network held operative in Europe, that is why in the investigations took part, apart from the Thai services, other European police units, that is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days blows similar to that recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were detained in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the leaders of the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be on behalf of young men between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connect the detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay bombing, even though the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that a few days before this attack was committed, Catalonia was sent through a transfer agency a few miles of dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used later by the integrated "commando" who killed 106 people.
The police have seized extensive documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exhibited during the campaign and which are limited to giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philosophical-sovereignist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to approach half of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan popular has arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that will be exercised by the oppositions to abstain in the vote of the nomination.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but for the time being, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are done in Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, in order to support an investiture "it would be necessary to eliminate all sovereignist and independenceist discourses", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bets to reduce the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomic administration and the elimination of the tax applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of the Mas nomination negotiations will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the dead were not due to the "lack of measurements"
Owners of Olot Centre do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
Geriatric officials La Caritat d'Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible in the meantime.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, introduced himself with the centre's lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be to be able to charge the person responsible" for the dead but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for failing to detect in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day on he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - care he suspected that in many cases no doctor would personally explore the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied yesterday this situation and mentioned that "the lack of measures can never have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there is only a hint of imprudentness on the part of anyone other than the accused."
The person already named "The Angel of Death" confessed the day before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused him death by injecting a sober dose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pellets.
The director of La Caritat mentioned that it is complicated to control the access of the centre's staff to medicine.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the pain of the interns, used to kill them.
But the laboratory analyses will clarify if Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or otherwise he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the interval 12-17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the nurse at night, nor do they rule out the possibility that the number may be greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change in the way of killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday which warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
Peripheral differentials have closed to force and the actions of European banks have suffered more than 5%.
However, neither should we underestimate the ECB's ability to make a mistake and the euro has barely recorded an increment, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market which in the same way as it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by fences of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose fear.
A month ago, ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those remaining.
Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures over time and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, it is hoped that the current liquidity measures "at least until March" will be extended and that the quarterly unlimited-access auction will continue at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond purchase programme will continue and that the signal will even be given to intensify it.
If they do not fulfill the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, may God help us!
As well as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered purchasing bonds and they collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal dropped 30 basis points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland the figures for Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The estimated figures represent 10.000 million in the short term and 15,000 potentials and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not having detected the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumable in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a state of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures which the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the Autonomous Communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to reactivate employment sound like the ears of investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange has suffered the 4.5%, the double that the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and we have the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it resolves with strong demand and helps to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to request an Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in available liquidity, triple compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "except to be, to appear."
Courage, we can make it!
Eulen's president will challenge Vega Sicilia's council requested by his sons
The storm does not cease in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, for he considers it "nothing by law", the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, solicited by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management organs of the firm titular of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José give their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of one part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company business services does not appear to be willing to transfer in his dispute to be present in El Enebro's governing bodies.
From his board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors at the shareholders' meeting of January 18 this year whose contestation is registered in the Register of Commerce and Companies.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Magistrate Commercial Number 2 of Madrid, opened again the thunderbox within the Álvarez family.
The use of the judge to determine the meeting is, until the dispute is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the meeting.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as a "desperate recourse of the applicants his five sons to try, through a procedural argutie, by clearly breaking the Law and by abusing the right, to validate and correct the assembly radically null on 18 January", according to its official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for contesting the assembly once it has taken place, considering that it is "not by right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless solicits usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the motion for challenge for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret Siemens weapon
Software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the Formula 1 world in 2004, his story in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
In a first moment, nobody took into account the options of a new stable that had just arrived, despite the ascending trajectory of the last seasons, the past November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without reducing the skill as a driver of the champion, the German Sebastien Vette, no longer the ability of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the Formula 1 world we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
This is in fact a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very distant objectives from the high motoristic competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly lines from factories that manufacture everyone, energy stations, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, accurately simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in his Formula 1 plant allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements detected during the races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season.
In Red Bull's team today 180 young high-quality professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and plan any kind of modifications on the cars.
Siemens's leader explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's cars except the engine, which is Renault's exclusive responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety components are modified.
Changes can shift from virtual reality from simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced high-tech laser and autoclave production systems.
As a single limitation of this madness of technological improvement there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that's going on over there is considered "top secret."
The staff for this assignment consists of 580 people, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula One hero, no doubt, is Sebastian Vetell's recent champion.
Between the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is priceless and the notoriety null.
The plant's technology manager, Steve Nevey, says five years ago it could be said that R+D progress in the case of racing cars brought 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of success, while drivers bring 15% of added value.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 clean stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first in the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational is planning to set up in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Vice-President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the renovated shop located on the Gran Vía of Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to set up 200 brand outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openings were in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be affected in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of institutional staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive network of shops claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, assistance, post-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-class pioneer pilot program that solves the possible problems of HP computer equipment in warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is designed especially for MPEs and users, as the large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," noted Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'flying' a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell's managing director, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
In spite of this, it foresees a collapse of interest margins, which will be tried to partially offset with increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million particular customers, his task to accomplish.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011, which will last three years.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to resort to FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market share by capturing a million new private customers - 700.000 if one deduces those who can leave the bank - its great task to accomplish, because so far this bank had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the particular customer.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with the reduction of costs as objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disturbed all plans in the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year his Optima master plan, established four years ago, even if initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for one more exercise.
Customers who let savings banks escape will be his main objective.
During a breakfast organised by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the war of liabilities - which penalises margins - is decreasing, the price of risk premiums that banks and caisses pay for its issues in order to obtain liquidity are already moving at the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure on credit."
"We didn't tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November-.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "we will ask for larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he said.
He claims that capital needs "increase greatly" and that some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentioned that FROB could replace the market in the capture of funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
After asserting that Sabadell can survive the temporal closure of markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks are already predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
He pointed out that one could not issue, but on the contrary of what had happened in June, one could obtain short-term funding through rest, which mitigated the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among credit unions
The ECSC Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is carried out.
When the merger of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would reserve for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been carried out, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, they are adjustments."
"Most of them have been completed completely; it is possible that instead of going to 17 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation as well," stressed the leader.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Aragón Executives (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process is being carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is being carried out within the deadlines set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he imphatized.
"The passage of 45 cases with an average of 28.500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a trial without equal in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be compliant with Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of rather unhappy opinions on the slowness of the process" which show "a lack of serosity and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain is doing is reminding us that the deadline must be respected before the end of the year".
The ECSC Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world and attributed to those who doubt it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "goes at the greatest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had done well in the stress tests that ECB had carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has opted to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have led to a doble government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of aid to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins with Chancellor Angela Merkel's criticism of her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which shocks with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, in Germany we are beginning to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, although now it seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macro-economic control, fiscal rigour, fines to the countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for a long time, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (fiscal rigour plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow of the central European country was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
Since then it has been the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and published were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel once again expresses a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties in order to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European because it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although slightly watered down, has been approved and in the following months we should be attending the process of reform of the Union which makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think to cross.
And it tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not be too much in agreement, from that date the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new currency zone, in which countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves in cessation of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany points out that we must follow a severe path of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a question of renewing the government deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're being asked for is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will lead to greater tranquillity.
And that we know how to seize the opportunity we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard of this form and its double declaration (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of the new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticisms, we have opened the way to the thesis that it is necessary to put order at home.
But the red line Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities we are considering, we cannot exclude the possibility of abandoning a monetary zone too full of countries that are not serious.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the will to escape punishment.
The expulsion of two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match of November 23rd against Ajax in the Champions League made a lot of ink on the anti-sports character of such behavior and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the game (which their team had already clearly won), both players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually be leader of its group, both players will complete the regulatory sanction during the next game of the barrage game against Auxerre and will be able to pass without boxes to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Discipline Committee sanctioned with two games the team coach, José Mourinho and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, if not rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that appeared in the related case was due to the fact that this had been the protagonist of a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem displays nobility and honor and which on past occasions sentenced its players to a fine for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his dilated history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour, not expressly prohibited by the regulation, contradicts the principles of sport, that is to say, whether with these actions one commits a fraud by law; because, in fact, they are actions respectful of the sports regulations, but seem to elude its meaning.
The question is to look at the type of harm they cause to sportsmanship.
One of the assets that understands sportsmanship is the physical integrity of opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put in danger, i.e. there has been no violent game.
Another of these assets to which reference is made with the correct game is to prevent the team of infractors from profiting in an unfair way from the contrary team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not accommodate itself to what is normally characterized as cheating o fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalization of the referee.
They were waiting and willingly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders obtain from the intentional faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put the rival in a position of disadvantage and one does not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action presupposes leaving their own team with fewer players.
And that's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Of course the advantage is that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without boxes that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players complete a penalty game and pass to the second cycle of cartons, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, climbing the ladders, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which is still part of the strategic decision-making that favours the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not operate to avoid the application of the penalty (it would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law),m otherwise they chose rather the time in which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without foiling the penalty or running away from it.
Even though the boundary between genius and the fraud of the law is diffuse, on this occasion I think we had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, appears because of two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the way in which the director was transmitted to provoke them.
The evil caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the touron and the lottery, when December arrives also the group dinners before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for the restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have resulted in an offensive adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, coincide the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
To complete the accounting challenge, this year's calendar (as the night of Saint Sylvestre falls Friday) concentrated requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 17th and the 17th) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all ask for battle prizes, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer's representative, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before they book."
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prices," he says.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers have the tendency to go down a step with the crisis, so that the slice around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey of various institutions in the centre, we find the collapse of applications for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras Group indicates that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar assumed more advance reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We did the impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they say.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, remains optimistic after having detected an increase in billing since the second semester and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate in advance of the holidays.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, like Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies invite their employees again and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
On the part of the employers Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, entrusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that overall reservations are "animated", even if customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That is true, the hope for the festivities has not diminished, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is causing great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks filtrations confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy of Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State filtered through the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused in Washington by Pakistan's nuclear programme.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details of the content of the conversations and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, is "decreasing" and that the instable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear programme — the fact that weapons are not assembled, but they are stored in components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack — is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
For example, Ambassador Anne W. Patterson of Pakistan listed in a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise runs and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep the guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered through Julian Assange's portal is the ever-reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of Pakistan's production of nuclear weapons.
A dispatch from the Embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", argues: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Army Chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to convey to the official "very clearly" that "the Pakistan Army must end with tacit support for terrorist groups".
Hunting the Wikileaks Chief
Obama will number a high-ranking figure in the fight against terrorism to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have any certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, this one is not new, otherwise it dates from 20 November.
And this one has nothing to do with the last filtration of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents from the United States but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creative lawyer, Mark Stephens, says that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
On the 20th the international police force with headquarters in Lyon (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after having received permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have been advised to identify or locate Assange "in order to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot issue an arrest order for an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanation, consider the appeal red notice a free way to arrest -- which the national police force must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be present.
The movement outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday issued a letter condemning the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder's willingness to answer questions from the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Laverentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief of security of Stalin.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," denounces the missive.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother is defending his son's innocence - Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday he gave an interview from an unknown place to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he asked for the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If we can show that she was responsible for giving orders to the American graduates they are watching at the UN by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us at all," he said for CNN.
Obama himself has instructed a senior anti-terrorist officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent further document leaks.
President Barack Obama's spokesman's attempt to reduce Assange's importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, the congressman who from January will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House, asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance".
Further on, Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had to come back to his statements after saying Assange should be "murdered."
"Obama should turn it into an objective and use an unmanned plane or something similar."
One person who did not ask for an apology was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"He who is in the government who filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not a execution would be too kind punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with a wink to Carod's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve the umpteenth internal revolt inside ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that this can absolutely not give him headaches that he had with other extinguished currents.
This is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with winks that allow him to blindfold himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to pass a certain penalty vote on the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the chief of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he said that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to Bulgarian" would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand the president a little more than putting his position at the disposal of militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximal organ between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve with the executive a road map until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the National Council for voting on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the Congress for the autumn of 2011, which the leaders consider a safe fact.
The ERC leader has admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that its objective is to ensure that once and for all the organization is able to wash its laundry with the family.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog results symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five, two of which he points out.
The first, "reconstitute" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, i.e., include new figures from Carod's adept sector.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that once and for all ERC liquid assembly as operating mechanism.
Thus, it defends a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of the congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Finishing with the model of assembly, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, was an obsession of the team of Puigcercós, which has already struggled in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the conclave convulsive of 2008 instructed the management to revise the model of assembly in a specific congress to reform the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time could be good to take it back and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to MILEnio of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to MILEnio of the State of Mexico.
Between the murders these of three women are mentioned and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
During the penultimate month of the year there were 390 deaths in theory related to organized crime.
Between the cases one mentions that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the head stroke, apart from the hands and feet tied with a cable.
The next day, the corpse of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the luggage port of a vehicle abandoned in the street Mixtecas in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, of the municipality Naucalpan.
Very early in the morning on Thursday, the four, the owners of jointly exploited lands found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the thorax, on the autopiste near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots when he was leaving his house to initiate work on garbage collection.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a shot at the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc settlement, a municipality in Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the gunshot of grace in the forehead, we found the corpse of a man on a lonely path to Colonia El Naranjo and under the body we found a bullet struck with a 25-caliber gun.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina settlement.
The emergency bodies carried out an exhaustive search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
Tepotzotlán residents alerted to the discovery of a corpse in Peña Colorada with their hands tied behind and blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound in his neck.
At half the month it was reported the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the department Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality Atizapán of Zaragoza, at the same time two death warning messages were discovered with the victims.
A day later, a box of cardboard containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the hamlet Zoquiapan of the Ixtapaluca municipality and the following morning the corpse of a man in Huixquilucan was located which had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, in agreement with a message that his executors had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck, a woman's lifeless body was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin we detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with her image.
Towards the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the edge of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet wounds and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of two men with their heads rubbed and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what is happening with those who do not align".
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with the hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside a taxi abandoned behind the Justice Centre of the San Agustín settlement.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first one had been decapitated in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next door; while the second one had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a bristol with a message.
China maintains greenhouse gas reduction targets
The COP16 representative assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it was maintaining its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and to reconvert its industry.
Indeed, he said, over the past four years his country had inverted $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but it would continue to work together with the international community in that area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all of these areas, including the approval last year of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives addressed with respect to greenhouse gas reduction, he explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local governments to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reductions.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans underway or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Program, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
There is also one provincial climate change project, one for the change of incandescent lamps through energy-efficient lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific advisor to the government of that country on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than we think.
For example, he said, the per capita greenhouse gas emission in China is three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the energy use, how to increase a 20% energy efficiency in the last five years and plans to make another similar one around 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN explained that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrinetos was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is right.
In the interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission of Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to address, where appropriate, a complaint to the Commission of Order of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body", he noted.
On the other hand, he informed that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections of the next 4 and 5 December when a successor would have to be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and has achieved its objective," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary "we enjoy it and make us stronger", he said.
He said that the council would no doubt be able to elect the best leader that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so it would give the successor "to the person determined by the council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the office of president of the party to any of the five."
He anticipated that the party's revival in the previous elections on 4 July would be reflected on the next fight, even if "it's not yet time to think about 2012. "
"For the moment it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have made "a lot of hope for them, and I am sure Gabino will live up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the priists to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they begin to defend them; that they come out of 'armoire'," he said.
He said that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Audience, because in the country there is no gag, and even less censorship.
Obama promotes law in Twitter for undocumented students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call you senators and ask them to approve this legislation," tweeted the US president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today gathered at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his Twitter social network personal account.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call you senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté Obama said.
His short message keeps a cybernetic link open with a larger document that asks the public to contact senators immediately, because voting on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we hope for soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was leaked after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts and government funding continue.
Such a blockage, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the republican blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said that it is confidant that once the tax problem is solved one can fix agende for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would request a "conclusion vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Law would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they have remained in that country for the past five years and they have been accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the support of a large number of Republicans, at times when the project's partisan organizations are actively lobbying to ensure approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson de Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar de Indiana.
That is why the supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Between the most courted Republicans there are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of office of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his posture so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the larger obstacles of the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature we put our finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of the Language was a walk in which participants displayed the narrative
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what do we hope of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of his question (at another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound "... puts us in an embarrassment", the Argentinian writer gently threw to the public, most of the young, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined afterwards as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what is the "pleasure", she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who took his breath out in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "On the wound I could only know that it is who is actually open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very connected between them.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a lovely narration that he called Éloge à l'invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous sorcerer who touched clouds, brought back people who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a damsel had lost, a narration that then veered to speak America, the great news that had from the beginning had her own columnists and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the narratives of the conquering capitans.
"Some who invented all of us (the writers) mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that even lacked modesty."
Nevertheless, he pointed out, "crazy and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with lies, we no longer know what part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is called the 'Tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is thanks to his heritage that we are what we tell."
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with his round table Le must on the wound.
The Cuban-Portuguese woman has put hers on the great wound of the social violence that her country is going through - and Latin America shares - produces disputes about trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think good literature, good poetry good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening is over with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "it must on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind each affirmation there is a small no and behind each negation there is a small yes".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we have to nuance: and nuance means many times putting the finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very convenient thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturbing the powers who prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting to regain the sense of writing.
Romano hunting his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he was able to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals, he had ups and downs in his career, but he was able to reach three times the decisive series, even if so far he has not put in the mile and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinian finally consoled himself with the sub-champion medal, he stayed a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santist strategist came to his first final as a coach in the Opening Tournament 2002, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later in the Closing 2003 he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again, as his team made an equal game of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournament, so he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to detach himself from the evil to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," the helmsman commented when asked what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, from which he assures that he learned a lot, "the only lesson we can remember is that until the referee whistles the final, we can't celebrate, we're prepared in the line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run and I think that's a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate".
He knows that this series could be defined as penalties, which does not worry him, because he entrusts in his players: "We never try to arrive at the series of penalties, we try to finish within the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare ourselves, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anguish of holding the title in our hands, it has escaped us, it has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we do not happen again in this situation".
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must go to the Service Centres for Visa Applicants prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing process at the Embassy and Consulates of the United States will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to report to the Visa Applicants Service Centres (CSAs) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have some advantages for applicants, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for processing the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visa applications (this includes visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for commercial and investor visas.
Individuals wishing to renew their visas will not be required to attend an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only report to the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and be fingerprinted.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken from the CSA, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants to the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra rate of $26.
For more information on the new visa application procedure, visit the following page: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA to Announce Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The United States Space Agency has quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday, at 13:00 hours at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present who would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", which prompted speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that we thought were uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if his living conditions were improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought to be too venomous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will communicate the true reach of the discoveries in tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
The conference will be attended by the geobiology Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who are studying Titan (the largest satellite in Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón 'bloc' opponent
With reforms to the Congressional Organic Law, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, we denounce.
The 60th had just settled in the Congress when an opposition bloc, led by PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, appeared in the Congress, which declared itself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, de PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, de PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tonned' against the reform of the Organic Law, as it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we initiate 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four deputies, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones voting against the Executive Board chaired by the PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality on the part of PRI and NAP.
He mentioned that the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme from a political will and if they do not, they will again be enslaved by both parties and in this way will end the opposition coalition.
"So far (the opposition coalition) has happened, that is what I am looking at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot allow, he continued, that the Congress, after having been monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is an eternal bipartism in Congress."
To begin with, this group begins with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues so that they will be more numerous, the Convergence abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that now the Congress has turned into a 'butin' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave by cupular agreements outside 5 which will probably be 9 MPs, now the five we are seen, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to seek a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they have made, that they have decided, we are outside and we do not agree with that reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
Mazatlán Town Hall pays another check to the owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque of about 200 miles pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Town Hall.
With this one, the amount that was paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipe, the last cheque number 9258447 was issued in the past 16 November for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in concept of "liquidation of accounts suppliers".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Audit Superior to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many more cheques will be issued to Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and 16 November.
Even though the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after 25 July Noroeste had published a revision of the cheques that the Town Hall issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the meantime March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipe paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be treated
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourist sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be treated and new activities must replace the others that tourists find bad.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affected because tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know the fortune you lose, elsewhere they didn't do the work for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Mangart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the Town Hall.
"The muncipee will have to assume his responsibility and avoid that it passes again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and only do the corrective," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must we maintain it, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the Town Hall must change its strategy to properly maintain the city".
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it only depends on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the attention they need and this type of fact highlights something that is well known to all, the interview is necessary".
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Secretary of Tourist Promotion, said the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlán is urgent, because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put together with the muncipe and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Happily Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that we should order first, clean and put us online to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination".
IP requests results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations that confront each other.
The business sector of Mazatlán asks for a law of work worthy and free of agreements between the parties and the government executive, because Sinaloa is convulsed and confronts major problems.
Yesterday the 60th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 deputies from PRI, 13 from PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives was installed.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress are a clean and engaged management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat themselves.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations that confront each other.
"We hope that MPs will actually exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to look after their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask that they certify the commitment to build the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making progress.
"We will ensure that they do a dignified and above all engaged work with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Mangart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in seeking the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and this in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs".
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Governmental Tourism.
"I understood that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and which competes directly with the agro-industry".
Apart from the need to classify resources to detonating tourism projects that help ensure the safety of the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for king Magus.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi Kings will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, for their home is formed by no more or less than 12 people and a kid.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear the toys and clothing they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day by day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell tangerines and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' for sale on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, José Alfredo, 10 years old, long aspires to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jesús, of 8 months, Cayetana suggests clothes of size for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I told him 'we'll see, my son', because he was very dear", remembers Cayetana sadly.
For older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, wears size 12; Isaías, 10 years old, wears size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, wears size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of the size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make reality the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the On Search King Mage campaign, by giving a toy or money at the reception of Noroeste.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches were carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that were allegedly used for drug production.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for the Sûreté du Québec.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two Sherbrooke men.
The arrested persons were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches were carried out following a long-term investigation, which lasted for almost a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests," Mr. Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigation module of the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Régie de police Memphrémagog took part in this police operation.
Clandestine migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives' bill, which, according to the government, should solve the problem of boats loaded with illegal migrants, will obviously be defeated while the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, who was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow for the possession of anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants for up to one year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The Bloc Québécois leader, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he was targeting the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," said Mr Duceppe.
The NDP's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has sidetracked criticism that her party is not firm enough about illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree that action should be taken against smugglers and that is what we are doing through another bill, the C-35," said Chow.
"We do not support the Conservatives' bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are massively telling MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country as a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections should it be rejected.
However, a Conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that each member who opposed it would then explain himself or herself to his or her constituents.
The new unity is not unanimous.
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public commission of inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, maintains that this idea is not a long-standing one: Quebec City would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue as early as last January.
The metropolis has a permanent unity on corruption since 1870.
Yet Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no more necessary for the pequist critic in public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe this announcement as a "spin out of a hat" and a "do-it-yourself solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence over the possible future unity.
"You'll see the result when we announce it," he says.
"We're aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the setting up of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr. Charest persists in not wanting to set up this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the École nationale d'administration publique.
To overcome this impasse, he suggested that Quebec City give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We need to be able to expand the mandate of the Auditor General," he says.
He also felt that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government boxes.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better respond to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague in the Department of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments related to this issue.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit motorcycle groups, although the Criminal Code was not adequate, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several rivers remain under high monitoring due to heavy rainfall that has occurred in several parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated on a preventive basis.
In the evening, another slip would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several areas, ranging from 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimetres of rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the region.
The areas north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
Because of the need to add these precipitation to the snowmelt already accumulated in some areas, there is concern that several streams may overflow.
Flood warnings were issued on Wednesday evening by the Sécurité civile du Québec for the Ouareau and the Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, at Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and the Oak, in Lotbinière, were the subject of flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall caused some lakes to overflow at Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In the Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes has resulted in the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Safety remains on the alert and monitors the situation closely," said Annik Bouchard, Security Advisor.
On Wednesday, the Centre de prévision des crues du Québec issued warnings of heavy floods for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, l'Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Dupont partially blammed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) for controversial remarks about social assistance and Haitians as well as his coarse language on the air.
The CBSC found that Mr.Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some of the comments contained "incorrect information about social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and coarse language that was not suitable for broadcasts during the day."
The Commission also found that a discussion on suicide, including the broadcast of the names of two individuals who committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Front commun des personnes aides sociales du Québec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were inaccurate.
Facilitators must present sound rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, host Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide to be a coward's gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupont le midi" addressed a sensitive issue in a fair and appropriate manner."
No reprimand was therefore held against him.
The last dispute concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then engaged in a media face-to-face that had elicited a lot of reactions.
The host of CHOI said that he had made no donation to help Haitians because we could not know with certainty that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already purged my three-day suspension on this."
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which must, among other things, announce these decisions once during prime time within three days.
King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs on the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, because for those who don't like ground play in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, one who works as a security officer and clerk for UPS has just released bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, October 23-30, Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing categories," he explained.
"Currently, I'm getting ready to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
"The fighters who finished among the top four in the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I concluded the tournament in fifth place, while I was third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've made progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I will be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punches and kicks, as well as projections on the ground, are allowed.
Duels take place originally on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous Puglist from this form of combat is the Vietnamese-born American Cung Le, well-known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will certainly answer his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explained the friendly fellow."
"It's kind of the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real pro," he analyzed.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other in order to crown only one champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without invitations to tender
Hydro-Québec has awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it was a consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor firms that obtained the largest amount, the project's management, for $295 million without any tender.
This consortium called Energy Stewardship was formed in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's choice to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Stewardship Consortium issued the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing price increases.
"It's the new way of collusion and cutting down on competition."
"In other words, people, instead of secretly doing this, now do it in an open way," said MP Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he says he has difficulty seeing how the public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there had been collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she pestered, arguing that the PQ had been "unethical" and had "lacked rigour."
She said that "it would be the least thing" that the PQ apologized.
The consortium formula is a common practice worldwide.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The project is in progress and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition; negotiations took place.
Also, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week by Le Devoir, the consortium formula in the consulting engineering sector is under investigation in the government.
A quick overview of Quebec's business register allows more than 200 consortia to be counted, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and the same legal person, Dessau.
With respect to the Energy Stewardship Consortium, Minister Normandeau noted that "the territory of James Bay responds to particular labour force dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded to them in a particular way since the 1970s."
The major manager of the Eastmain Project, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Corporation (JSB), gave an explanation that caused the project's management contract to swirl over.
"If you go to tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and say: we're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal with a good price."
"But the idea is that it is not the price that is important, it is the competence of people," Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Energy Stewardship Consortium is part of a long list of contracts over $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, Genivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention his participation in Energy Stewardship.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 Energy Stewardship contract.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Quebec Liberal Party".
Minister Normandeau let go that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "finance it", before making it clear that it was rather its leaders.
Responsible Consumption Barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly sceptical.
Quebec consumers have very little confidence in the players involved in sustainable development, but also in fair brands and greening certifications to guide their choices.
Worse, even if he bathes in a media world where messages in favour of more responsible consumption are growing, he deplores a lack of credible information, which he even describes as a brake on his commitment, says the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the companies' green advertising, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatoire de la consommation responsable at Université Sherbrooke.
Another observation: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands showing themselves to be eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, politicians' speeches on this topic are taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this segment of consumption currently driven by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of the information would calm the ardours of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers say they are equally suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services that are being put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and, above all, to have changed the brand of one or more products to meet their conviction.
At 61%, they have also favoured purchases from local traders and the purchase of food products grown in their area, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - the Homo consumer of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological awareness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, just 28% of Quebecers said they used public transit or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this vast behavioural survey, which has just taken its first shot.
A government loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which was asked to make a financial commitment to the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris by Société Angus and Le Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but up to one loan only.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, hoping for a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to buy from Daniel Langlois the cinema complex eXcentris on Saint-Laurent Boulevard by giving him his full cinephilic vocation, did not get what they demanded.
The government agrees to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would be less than the original expectations, which could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of the sources from the Crown's compendia.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who is piloting the eXcentris case.
He sent him a final report about ten days ago.
But the firm's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until 31 December to respond.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the gift of the State really has to be ruled out.
Recall that the Association des propriétaires de cinémas et de cinéparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the state to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it has not done for other cinemas.
On the contrary, a number of stakeholders in the community called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of ceans, for ten years carried the author's cinema to his premises of the complex after having financed his own construction, which could justify a derogation on the part of the Conseil du trésor.
The lack of theatres for independent films is crying out in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
The Société Angus and the Parallel, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private fundraising campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the acquisition wheel.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, has continued to broadcast films in eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three theatres on February 27 by screening the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des Dieus.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals made to them.
The veil raised over a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks shed light on what the U.S. considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians to the Americans, but at the same time they betray their sense of superiority over Canada.
Thus, U.S. diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canada-U.S. relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government pass its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out in the public square yesterday, offer more crispy details than substantial content to put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the midst of a federal election campaign, tells how much the United States is not one of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great astonishment of the U.S. ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offered some explanation for this situation.
"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may make it necessary for Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues in everyday life rather than to have this election focused on the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)," he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it".
The ambassador understands all the less this deafening "silence" because the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote."
The other expression of this sense of importance is in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival in the confidence vote on the federal budget in early February, by which Canada will have its first deficit in more than a decade because of a recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion," Breese writes.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that CBC drama shows are sending back from the United States.
The Ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O programs, in which there are unsubtle references to Maher Arar, the No-Fly-List, or abductions for CIA muscle interrogations.
Another cable relates that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he handed over a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary has agreed to review the file."
Let's finally note that the spirits are warming up about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered".
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
Yesterday in Cancún, the United Nations proposed a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs), which corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in line with the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to have adopted in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market were replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode bulbs (LED or "LED" in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHGs emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That's the equivalent of 70% of global car fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase aggregate GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract from this balance sheet still 5 Gt in order to stabilize by 2020 the rise of the climate to 2 degrees centigrades in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent ampoules, 95% of the energy dissipates as heat and the rest, 5%, produces light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this need for energy is reduced by twice again.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, like those launched by manufacturer Philips this week - this company participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent light bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These all new bulbs can also work with rheostates in addition to emitting very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
A number of specialists have posted reserves for compact fluorescent light bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place guidelines.
But, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact bulb, but rather the coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make as a result of this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants, the construction of which would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire waits for the announcement of election results in the nervousness
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the deadline has expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," said a spokesman for the UN leader.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission missed the deadline of Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's election.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the president of the CIS had told television that the commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
The calls multiplied on Wednesday in the world for the CIS to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the Constitutional Council to cancel "faudulous" votes in the north, held by the ex-rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian president, said that the intimidation of voters by the FN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The whole election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's complaints were upheld by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any connection with the former rebels, considered "unacceptable" the delay in announcing the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that bringing a complaint to the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, on Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that had been split in two for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the lead of the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, which received the public support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including the overseas departments), show the provisional seasonally adjusted data (CVS) published on Thursday by INSEE.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in metropolitan France.
Data for the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the working population in metropolitan France and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate is rising by 0.1 percentage points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people on the labour market has deteriorated further, with a further rise in the unemployment rate, rising to 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points over three months + 0.5 points over one year) and 25% including the French overseas departments.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
Seniors, for their part, experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points over three months and also over one year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only 25-49 year-olds benefited from stable unemployment in the third quarter, 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
INSEE has not published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy about its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and placed in detention
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, manager of waste companies and brother of the PS president of the Bouches-du-Rhône General Council, was indicted and imprisoned at the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been indicted for abuse of social goods, misappropriation of public funds and property, concealment, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, says his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions the magistrate is going to ask him, not fantasies."
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible counts, it is something else to prove them," said his lawyer, Florence Rault, to the AFP before the hearing of his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS strongman in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, had, through his lawyers, to pass to the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged on Wednesday night and imprisoned.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than run the dumps he had to handle.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he never knew of them, said Mr Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was charged on Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial supervision with prohibition to meet the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain the facts against him."
"The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his liberty," said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been indicted and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them being placed under judicial supervision, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "traffic of influence and passive corruption".
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are under investigation for "subtraction and misappropriation of public goods by a person entrusted with a public service mission", the other for "complicity in misappropriation of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was charged for "recel of abuse of social goods".
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies were used to launder money from big banditry.
The investigation is carried out within the framework of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous mails, for alleged frauds in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
From a source close to the survey, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from certain cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysée exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", held the public in breath in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful gaze of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the undersides of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, even giving them advice on how to deal with their own "hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not been matched by the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the American courts for trafficking in materials for the benefit of Iran's nuclear programme.
Finally, they place under a harsh light the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, this was not the case.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostage cases".
The Elysée Advisor for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, meet with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own forcibly held nationals to Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "get the words "fundamental human rights," "innocent," "immediate release" in the media.
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more because the Iranians are asking you not to do it."
For, past attempts to discuss through discreet channels, "silence will not settle anything", the Iranians are "masters in dilatory maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day she takes refuge at the French Embassy) "will require the payment of a large amount of money to Iranians" (€230,000 in bail).
And he says that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will worsen".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but remains stuck in Iran.
Information is being disseminated: Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, by a judge's decision.
The American Embassy, like many observers, wonders about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iran's clandestine procurement networks for nuclear programme equipment, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a bargain?
The liberation of the Iranian from that of the French?
In a further interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he said, was not only "completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There was a lively exchange between the French presidency and the keeper of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot go back on the decision" judicially, he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of French intelligence services.
The Elysée Councillor dials a telephone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée is making every effort, through press releases and "leaks" organised in the media, to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influent" role as "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity, not without irony, and note that manipulation is bearing fruit since several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
On what basis is so much "gratitude" expressed towards Mr. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their praising statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The paper then looks at the reasons that led the Elysée to pour into this fiction.
The intense communication effort "to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which "had been perceived by many critical voices in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "show Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also "to sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows that from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called "Cinderella law" that will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, said government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under 16 years of age, said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the ministerial head responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents so request, he added.
It will also make available to people who demand it free software to limit the amount of time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
Global 2018-2022: Fifa designates organizing countries
In turmoil due to suspicions of corruption, the Executive Committee of the Fifa designates on Thursday the countries organizing the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where the struggles of influence and lobbying may take precedence over the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Queen Fifa competition will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its settlement in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities from the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political stakes of a World.
Behind-the-scenes negotiations may therefore last up to the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the Fifa evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the origin of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football which hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC released a documentary featuring three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to displease the Fifa and embarrass the English officials, who have engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of government hopes to repeat the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had secured the organisation of the Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity suffice to restore the coat of arms of England to the EC?
Nothing is less safe because the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in assets with its already ready stadiums, its expertise (Global-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which became an outsider of weight despite the deficiencies of its file (stades, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and denounced an "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, with its 1994 experience, appears to be the logical favourites.
As the world's leading economic power, home to Fifa's main sponsors, the country seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, which separately built a very beautiful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organised the event in 2002.
Another threat is the granting of the World 2026 to China, ardently desired by the Fifa, which would de facto render the Asian chances null and void for 2022.
With Qatar, which has released the big game by offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, the Fifa would continue its expansion to new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the low TV fees paid (due to the jet lag) by European countries, the nerve of the Fifa war.
Second mandate: the obvious
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made it seem like he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation whatsoever.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they did.
One mandate at the Elysée calls another.
So the current Head of State will be running in 2012.
But the evidence does not fit well with the mystery part attached to the presidential function.
Then we have to pretend that the doubt still exists.
In one way or the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy assured himself that he would take his decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011".
On Tuesday evening at the Elysée, the prospect of "two terms" was evoked in front of UMP parliamentarians.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were a long way off.
The president merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional review limited the number of quinquennats to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that he evokes the presidential, in the tone of humor, during such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he had launched in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His words the day before yesterday did not make him more a candidate than the day before; they did not make him less.
If they get comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race to the PS application, on the one hand.
But it is not the entry into the contest of Ségolène Royal that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many of the PS are calling for an earlier-than-expected battle order.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this," immediately and cautiously reacted the Prime Minister's entourage.
"If he believes the possible defeat, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," says Alain Juppé, obviously resigned.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the modalities for ending the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of many of the non-conventional monetary policy operations that are due to end at the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis is forcing, and the Frankfurt issuing institution may not be able to afford to be as peremptory as it is, or it may worsen a situation that is more than tense today on European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, welcomed the ECB's active role in supporting the resolution of the state debt crisis in Europe.
It did not wish to say whether it believed that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...)".
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more dissertation as to his intentions, merely stating that the programme for the purchase of State securities on the secondary market was continuing and that "we will see what we will decide" at this Thursday's meeting.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main policy rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled to nearly €1.35 billion last week.
And, according to market operators' indiscretions, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that there will be a continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect a significant change in course.
While lending operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on generous terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this arrangement to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that she's making a major change to her program."
Michael Schubert, Commerzbank's economist, said: "If not, it would take the risk of creating new tensions in the short term.
"A gradual release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely", Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal, predicts.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its intervention in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these bonds to animate an atonous market", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European bank exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a package of the returns paid by the most fragile states", testified a major bond manager yesterday.
For if interest rates fly away, the states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
Safeguarding the euro is at that price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government makes the round back
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, yesterday the situation relaxed somewhat with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
A return to precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and expect a "unforeseeable" weekend, which he later denied.
On Tuesday, in any case, the gap with the long German rates had reached the record of 210 basis points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had risen to 263 points, leading to a certain panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the gap with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand, Gianni Letta, said he was "strongly concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is it's like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the sluggishness of tax revenues that goes along with it, putting the State at risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecast was a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," says Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of his economy are in order and his accounts are good, as we have been saying for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, neither in the short nor in the long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts required of Italy are less than those required of other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD Chief Economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would open up a period that is not conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde once again hammered him yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that we have shown it again Sunday in the day and at night, are obviously in solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although all relative, yesterday's relaxation on the rates of European government bonds brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet talk about the beginning of normalisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt rating, the target today most targeted by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs on banking systems in particular," said Exane BNP Paribas economists.
All the more so since "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it presents, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis measures.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are well underway.
This is also in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started on Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform extreme-eastern investors about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, he certainly prepares the ground.
The first issues of EFSF securities are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official US representative told Reuters that the US would support a possible increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The frontline countries, Portugal and Spain, for their part, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms in addition to austerity measures with closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from Greece and Ireland.
Both of them want to avoid asking for international aid at all costs before putting in place their own budgetary adjustments and deciding on the structural reforms necessary to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of normalising sovereign bond markets.
Speaking in Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber first put forward the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to hand over to the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, consider that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would suffice, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism with EUR 60 billion to date.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsened.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alertness
Snowy episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigilance due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienna, were added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snow showers affect northern Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
Snowy episodes are enough notable to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, Météo France warns.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments have been banned from heavy goods vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend to take his vehicle only if necessary and the traffic of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked the airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights on the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly due to the coming snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in the Ile-de-France has been in full swing, the billions have been raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, the Grand Paris Metro, to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, is worth 23 billion.
To start this GSP, the state announced a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the GSP to borrow on the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally come to the first additions.
The 2010 Finance Act, which was discussed in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris".
It is quantified: "The revenue from this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a redevelopment of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, increase its product and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that cost?
Mystery.
It's not encrypted in the text.
We're far from four billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the capital endowment that will be mobilised by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project proceeds," the explanatory memorandum states.
At the GSP, this system is not shocking.
"From the moment we create recipes (both taxes, ed.), we can cover the studies over three years and then type in the 4 billion after, we explain there."
"This will be entered in the budget and drawn as and when".
The GSP estimates that the $4 billion will begin to be recorded in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the promised 4 billion are still to the absent subscribers, risks causing a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers vengeful and spies in diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it turns out to be an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and prefigures a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file made up of a secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those of which Berlusconi is the owner), and Khadafi's sinister caricature profile has long been for cabaret artists to sketch.
The rule that secret files should be composed only of new ones already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous books.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do new research (no know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only in what they already know, and reconfirm what they had already learned.
It's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Same for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of limited mind) the head of the secret services (if not he could be, what do I know, editor of Libération), who holds as true only what he recognizes.
The top secret information on Berlusconi sent by the American Embassy in Rome to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the week before.
Then why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of state can phone themselves or take a plane to meet at dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small performance exercises, have turned into spy centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only through hypocrisy that we pretend to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to place American diplomacy in the wrong light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
So the scandal does not put the victims in so much crisis as the "bourreaux".
But let us come to the deep nature of what has happened.
Once, in Orwell's time, we could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely established since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when we show, as happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as a citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is true, too, that all knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret of secret, because it falls within the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to remove all power.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury to a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, the states will no longer be able to post any reserved information - that would be to publish it on a poster stuck at the corner of the street.
But it is equally obvious that with current technologies, it is futile to expect to be able to maintain confidential reports over the telephone.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relationships be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my forecast is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discreetly in uncontrollable stages, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept as a single copy in locked drawers: in the background, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing in crab, i.e. backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wire telegraph (telephones).
The videocassettes (analogical) had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going forward and backwards and discovering all the secrets of editing, while now the CDs (digital) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we travel from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the trips it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that communications policy and techniques should go back to horse-drawn cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secret of embassies.
Now it is the embassies that ask the press for confidential information.
Climate: how France interferes with its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the fulfilment of the fast-start or early-start financing commitments made by developed countries.
And the big French tweaks are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries committed $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (or 420 million a year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU released the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its member states, press conference, big side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency exercise is appreciated and appreciated: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
In 2010, the EU announced that it had committed €2.2 billion, putting it on the right track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, this money must be "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being to the detriment of Official Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference year: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
In contrast, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' expenditures or to the overall level of Official Development Assistance.
In concrete terms, France's total amount of support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to fulfil its commitment to "new and additional" funding...
Another crucial element is the distribution between grants and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that 1€ loaned is equivalent to 1€ given.
Obviously, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
While the use of loans can be justified for some profitable investments (often projects related to mitigation of emissions that rely on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... At most, it should be counted against its commitments only the cost of the loan to the lending country (equivalent to an interest rate).
But France has nothing to do with such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1€ to meet its commitment, France only puts 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
That's a nice trick.
In short, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it manages to make it believe that it is spending 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy did the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it was enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter on early financing is only a small, relatively short-term issue in relation to all climate discussions.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting method for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently under discussion): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
Hope therefore rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Warning of pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published this Wednesday by Generations Futures (ex-Movement for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have any significant statistical value in relation to the small number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem addressed", bought between July and September the foods generally consumed in four meals and one snack in one day by a child of about ten years old, in supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as treats, were examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as certain carcinogens as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individual chemical substance are not exceeded, it is clear from our survey that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is of concern," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three known as certain carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack by the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, one of which is a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenya green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, minced steak, canned tuna, and even the baguette and chewing gum were filled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the microwave meal was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of this "contaminant cocktails" is "probably underestimated", according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "in the face of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
