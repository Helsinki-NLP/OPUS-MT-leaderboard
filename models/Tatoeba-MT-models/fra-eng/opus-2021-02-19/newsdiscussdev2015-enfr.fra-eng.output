Sounds like a typical rugby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Nothing to do with the rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But that doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that it's common in rugby is big shit...
Finally, we don't interrupt the prayers of Muslims and we don't break anyone's nose during drinking games (well, unless it's part of the game), but we actually painted in black for some disguised evenings.
I've never played a Nazi-themed drinking game that said.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the prospectus of first-year students seemed quite typical to me.
That said, this new information leaves no doubt to me that they go much further than misogynistic jokes and jokes under the influence of alcohol, which are often associated with university rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows particularly well that they are trying to provoke as much as possible.
You probably don't know anything about rugby clubs.
But come on, why let your prejudices and stereotypes hinder the facts?
I imagine that the rugby team LSE is populated by former students from these schools for whom the rugby competition is a tradition.
In other words, former boys from the private sector.
Coming from very different backgrounds than those who play rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
So misogynistic jokes are acceptable?
It looks like my college rugby club, I've never seen any racist behavior, but nude races through campus, theft, damage to property and misogyny were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't mention that in my last comment.
You can see it differently: tell yourself that your own body itself is partly composed of this ancestral water.
I'm going to gain some serenity.
ancestral also this interstellar cloud (few, not traditional:)
@lux You didn't read the article well: a small half of the water in your pastis is more than 4.6 billion years old...
Yes, so we can still consider that the fleet of pastis has on average easily more than 2.3 billion years, which is already not so bad that
A hell of a nose for the catastrophists and warmers of all kinds who predict the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water always existed.
An irrefutable proof that the warming stopped 20 years ago (see the remarkable work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
@manon troppo: How is this proof that the warming has stopped?
I don't see the connection.
I believe that Manon Troppo's commentary is ironic.
Uh, and for the second degree and irony what do you have for signage?
So you don't understand much about ecological issues.
It is not a question for the "catastrophics" as you say to worry about the disappearance of the oceans but rather about the reduction of supplies of water consumed by humans (you know the fresh water that represents less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally it is not climate warming that is the most threatening for our species but above all the reduction of scarce or not renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our increasingly greedy lifestyles.
As for the study which you cite and whose generous effort you make to cite the source, it is natural to doubt the veracity of the conclusion.
Regarding freshwater problems, I reassure you the French are far from being concerned xD Then we must stop considering ecology as an unfailing dogma, the hole of the ozone layer is closing quietly (estimated at 100% for 2050 at the current rate).
Ecology yes, religiously dogmatic and irrational ecology, no thanks.
"Then we have to stop considering ecology as an unfailing dogma, the hole in the ozone layer is closing quietly" Yes, at last it is not as if it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that global warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our earth will look like Venus.
A greenhouse that by the action of oxygen will capture the heat without releasing it and that in a vicious circle will accelerate the greenhouse process exponentially.
Has anyone seen any direct actions so far?
Or any sign that 10,000 men would have come to the field to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, no matter what?
I'm not sure I'm not!
In Abbott's little brain, perhaps sending the RAAF to the Middle East is his version of a direct action.
We're moving backwards, that's for sure.
When are they gonna get rid of that idiot from the village?
The latest revelations that vegetation consumes 16% more CO2 than any allowed climate model give priority to replanting.
This makes no sense, since CO2 is the food of plants that is most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flora all over the world.
Looks like this scientific fact has never been flattened.
Did you see the Green Army anywhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument for plant food is just a fallacious distraction.
And before you throw your glass against the Dooms wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulphur.
Perhaps the most abundant of biologically generated materials is carbon, but that doesn't mean it's the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead's argument is misleading and deserves to be ridiculed.
Direct Action is a farce, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was most beneficial, it is now being invested where it will get the most publicity to bring the Liberals back to the marginal electorates.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the prize of ignorance, bravo champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants perform less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
This means that animals and people need to eat them in much larger quantities to enjoy their nutritional benefits.
It is obvious that this Member of Parliament is childish.
To date, he has not submitted a certificate of academic rigidity which prevents him from departing from the rules of the seventeenth century.
However, sanctioning him and not Thévenoud is incomprehensible for a lot of people, even if the NA regulation is not a tax treaty.
That this lady makes a big deal out of it is not to her credit, it appears mostly as hysteria.
If Mitterrand had fined all those who pronounced Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of names, the "Academy" was offended: "let's say, Mrs. La Gardeuse ou la Gardesse des Sceaux" (a position which until then had never been occupied by a woman).
Pure chauvinism!
"The political arena " ....!
The sandbox, the back yard of the Republic replete, the marigot of operetta gullies, the tablee of illusions, etc.
But the arena assumes gladiators, people who take real risks, willingly, unwillingly.
Qd the Phallocrat Umpist sits on the label and the parliamentary rules by spraining the elementary civility under the false umbrella of good manners, the sanction applies to him "the quality" for his partisan stubbornness and his misuse of the political arena.
This Member's behaviour is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's doing provocation to make people talk about him.
Until now he was unknown, now he can pride himself on being known as is known any canker of a primary class.
The academy on the right back and we see that the deputies are sensitive from the pocket...
The UMP will have to work to solve its internal problems and stop causing couchs and scandals.
The Academy has a good back, especially when she's being told what she's not saying.
This deputy behaves like a college student in the middle of a teenage crisis, who makes provocation and whose friends will, in delegation, see the Principal to have the hours of glue canceled.
and defending it on the basis of a text they have not even read!
Women do not even represent 15% of the signatories to this forum of MPs UMP.
Your Honor, I am calling on two expert witnesses who are several thousand years apart.
That's why I like to spend time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and attractive.
Dogs, dolphins, sea lions, horses, they all do stupid things for the simple pleasure it gives them.
On the other hand, it seems that we spent the majority of our 80 years working, moving and shopping.
What a strange phase we have reached - we are able to double our lifespan, but we pass the majority into boredom.
How did we get there?
Thanks to the illusion of anthropomorphism.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
Moreover, "communication" necessarily implies a shared symbol system.
A difficult concept for you, perhaps?
I imagine that the concept of inter-species communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variance that indicates whether the game will be a race, an object to be picked up, etc.
It's not difficult and there's no anthropomorphism – although I agree with the idea that you hear a lot of bullshit about animals that are "playing" while they're just communicating.
Maybe the game isn't just "useful" (it can be, or not), it's just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber is of the opinion that "there is a principle of play at the basis of all physical reality."
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have raped her."Maybe yes, hope makes life live...
Thank you for the hope of giving you the opportunity to live, to be healthy and to be able to answer an article today when you had to drink the news without being able to react just 15 years ago.
In general I am not against ideas, and would even tend to be rather excited by those who seem crazy at first sight.
But when we see what many have learned from their teaching at school, especially among the public most likely to attack women, my enthusiasm does not find the slightest beginning of an anchor point.
"The public most likely to attack women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's okay, we got it.
And yes, reality doesn't always smell like rose, even if it doesn't necessarily fit your thinking patterns.
It is true that the golden youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods do not listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iphone6.
Evry's helpless youth too!
If the reacs did not react, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Le Pen and Sarko in first choice.
I didn't learn from all this at school and I never raped anyone (and it's not my intention).
Should I consider myself lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me certain values...
Family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How do you start reading life when you can't read?
And do young socialists go to suburban schools to teach equality between men and women?
It would be more effective than making moralising montages on Twitter, but we'd have to get out of the beautiful neighborhoods...
Grotesque this campaign.
They suck everywhere, but to give morale lessons, they're still the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but yet I want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke there about using his bread.
This week's article doesn't go easy.
It's not time to make jokes about bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You made a two-way wordplay with the word "naan" to refer to a grandmother.
60 pounds for that?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach of a 90-year-old in a nursing home.
How come the more we pay, the less on the plate?
Because the quality of the experience is not necessarily measured by the weight or the number of calories, just as the quality of a film or a piece is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a sparrow?
It doesn't make any sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to get you to buy more food.
Of course, this must not be the case.
The Sportsman in Seasalter at least is a very good restaurant where portions and prices are both reasonably high.
You pay more because you are still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more expensive you pay, the more likely you are to receive a child’s portion arranged with art on your plate.
At least they made the effort to put on tablecloths.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can enjoy good food?
Is the Manifesto for All only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's right: some sort of homophobic gathering.
But it's not just that.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern "child-making" systems.
A child must not be reared in a battery farm or manufactured by technological equipment.
Batteries?
Where did you get that from?
And if you challenge any technical intervention in "manufacturing", you have to demand the ban of the PMA for heterosexual couples, it would have the merit of coherence.
I am surprised that the so-called "for all" demonstration does not yet have this logical claim to its attractive catalogue.
It is true that it is not the only Catholics who demonstrate: the other religions also, Jewish, Muslim, Protestant.
This being said, it is still useful to remember that these different churches have ALWAYS been opposed to all developments in society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr Dupanloup was violently protesting against the gvt's desire to admit girls to school in the name of "the defence of the family".
We're still in the same pattern.
And, more recently, the same currents screamed at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school became mixed.
That is the credit that can be given to the positions of these people.
You don't have to be a catho to be indignant about the commodification of bellies and children...
All this is in the straight line of the decadence of Western civilization, increasingly contested by others!
For me, freedom stops at that of others: yes to the recognition of homosexual couples who have as much right to love each other as others.
But there is no question of allowing the child to be a movable object.
And this also applies to heteros looking for GPA.
I just can't seem to like this guy, or recognize his results.
If he had better control of the ball and knew how to avoid moments of stunned stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
Plus, I'm sure any other attacker, apart from Heskey, who plays so many matches for England, will have a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have scored if he had been given more than 42 national team selections...
I can't disagree, at least not categorically:) Since this article talks about the goals he scored, I'm not going to talk about the other things he brings, especially to ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa don't bring or don't bring anything), but maybe that would be another reason why he won was much more often selected than, say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12h48 Recommends 119 It's fashionable to criticize Rooney right now so we can forgive you for doing so too.
That said it is good to take into account that since signing with Manchester City in August 2011, Agüero has scored 56 goals and made 23 assists in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and made 32 assists in 96 matches.
So a lot of people will have to find another excuse to go after our Wazza because his stats on the ground are excellent.
Moreover, "Wazza" is rather a good reason to ridicule it.
I have to ask myself if you really look at football or if you think Peter Crouch A) would deserve as many selections as Rooney and B) would score as many goals if he had had so many selections.
I really don't understand where the criticisms come from about Rooney's abilities as a footballer.
The most difficult thing is to be selected regularly on his country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing Wayne Rooney's football skills (not even an attacker) to Peter Crouch's?
Are you kidding me?
There are really people in the crowd.
Please also note for your information that Rooney was not always England's fore-center goal machine during his career as a team from England.
Instead, he played the retired front, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You must have written that in a joke.
In a country where the carrying of weapons is tolerated and in a state where 71% of people own a weapon, I find it totally schizophrenic and paradoxical as a way to proceed.
Well, those at this school just don't agree with the authorization to carry weapons in the United States at all!
The use of pencil is still suicidal.
Stop bullshit: the girl is 5 years old.
How many kids play with fake guns at this age in our house?
Does that make them potential murderers for that?
Even if the carrying of weapons is in the American constitution and it necessarily affects the culture of the country, I do not believe that the American kids are significantly different from ours.
A little common sense and reason kept please.
It's a disarming process!
Surrender you have surrounded yourselves!
Information on this diverse fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl actually possesses, or does not possess at all, firstfruits to the taste of the morbid.
Could we assume that a serial killer can't already behave strangely at the age of five?
If people need a psych follow-up, it's more of a mess at this school than a student!
Let the parents get their kid out of here: she's in danger!
Totally agree.
Those who run this school are obviously completely ill.
Your reaction is the most relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state in the United States, but it is part of it.
What an incomprehensible damn country!
His relative youth?
Those bright blue suits men wear are nothing like an entrepreneur!
What was Alan Sugar or Richard Branson wearing at the beginning of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar wore a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson wore a turtleneck sweater.
I can't comment too much since I've never looked at this, but everything seems so boring and soulless.
I don't feel like that's what he meant.
Contrarier, maybe?
How depressing!
You're ahead of me.
I would have thought that a meagre knowledge of English would be an asset for business.
I wonder what Mr. Bjayou is doing these days.
Perhaps by saying "ostracize," he meant "alienate."
That would make sense.
No, I thought that's what he might have meant, but ostracizing still doesn't make sense.
At worst, if all the candidates dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar wore a gray suit, we could argue that their intention was to ostracize her.
But here, no.
It looks like it's been corrected – weird. Maybe the whole sentence was invented!
It's not weird.
Haha, who knows what he might have said?
Probably nothing, but someone absolutely wanted to quote something...
So yes, the word used in the article was "ostraciser," which meant absolutely nothing.
The unemployment rate in the United States fell again in August, some 6%.
Never seen since 2001.
Gas prices are falling in all states.
The American economy, together with Obama, is continually strengthening.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Their economy becomes "sustainable"?
To live there at the moment, I would say that the United States is getting closer to the explosion as inequality goes crazy.
The political system is literally rotted by the state of election campaign financing.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass imprisonment have a magnitude that is unimaginable in Europe, but Americans still have incredible optimism about the future of their country and theirs!
Until when?
That's the main question.
A few days ago the British financial community said that France was lost.
Now it's America that's at the end of its roll.
Fortunately, there will always be UK to save the world.
Another of these articles that simply forget the essentials.
The level of consumption of the US economy is no longer sustainable...
Debts and banknote boards can still not give the change...
Against a background of depletion of the Earth's resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And necessarily the weakest and poor, a very large majority of citizens, will "trinch" or rather bite.
I can't blaspheme that Farrage.
Will Labour finally understand that its cynical and deliberate policy of importing compassionate voters from abroad makes it lose even more support at home?
Probably not.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any cost.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their Cold War continues with Russia.
Shameful Labour performance, Ed Milliband is in trouble, it's played with 617 votes.
As for Clacton 11% for Labour – shocking, truly shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that Blair's government's massive immigration policy was designed "to fill the nose of the right with diversity."
Labour wins the by-election, the Tories lose the by-election in a safe seat against ukip = Labour in Crisis Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I guess it's the same multiculturalism that's driving this cranky comeback, the pendulum has started very far since the end of the war, and I guess now it's going to go back the other way.
Did you talk about your struggle against reality with a therapist?
Lol - Secure seat of Labour, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, anyone who's not in denial knows.
Of course, the Tories have seen much worse, but for Labour it's a Pyrrhic victory.
Look for the word "Victory" in any context, and you will see that when it is used in an argumentative way against the word "defeat", it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a win, but it's skinny.
Labour should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like this in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I'm indifferent no matter who wins in 2015 until the Lib Dems are there.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes I know the ice creams of Canada, Greenland and northern Russia fool on hard.
On the other hand, I wonder if the alignment of Venus and March etc. should not be considered too?
In general, one must see the Earth more "pasty" or malleable than one imagines.
Is that how it is?
A few perplexities.
On the other hand Wylie tells us of a "simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the earth's crust, the pressure on the mantle is released, which would give a) a boost to the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface ???
In any case, either the "lash of whip" or the facilitation of access to the surface will be localized (more or less).
Difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and vice versa As for global warming, it seems prudent to focus rather on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, patricedusud, does this volcanoism have an effect on our environment?
Does it affect our global warming, future or past?
Isn't it safe not to warm up anymore?
When complexity cannot be solved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe.
Yeah, but also, when it's dark, you see less.
Hello, the end of the last glacial period was also accompanied by greater seismic activity, especially in the "active" Mountain Chains or on the highly iced continental parts of Canada, Scandinavia).
Regards CB
It is all too often unknown that the earth's crust floats on the magma and that the moon's only passage brings it up or down from about 30 to 60 cm, delayed, following its passage to the zenith, as it does for the waters of the oceans.
This means that the slip of the tectonic plates, as well as the tides, is more or less facilitated by this moving bump, especially since the polar caps are lightened by the melting of the ice, thus causing a change in the balance of the land at the equator, since the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am enjoying this "human", saying to himself the supreme of Nature and its self-proclaimed commanding sponsor, ridicule himself by his stupid action on the environment that created it and of which he separated so much that it has become harmful, and to himself and this environment.
And all this to remain the supreme commander of this nature which exceeds him in the organization of his own viscera, by an invention which consists in finding all possible means to dominate his neighbor, one of the others, mocking collaboration, money.
The earth's crust is not based on magma, but on the earth's mantle, which is made of solid rock.
Personally, I find him impossible to look at.
Pretentious and arrogant.
It reminds me of Bronowski's Ascent of Man.
Long live the next game.
Beautiful story Wild1
Rather, it reminds me of a totally awesome series from about 2002 called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely enough, almost no one remembers it now.
Too bad you never overstepped the first impression.
Your loss...
"The geladas, our distant ancestors" You should look again at this passage.
Or read about evolution.
Great program thanks Brian
I am almost certain that the documentary "History of Humanity" has already been made several times, they still go to Ethiopia (obviously)
Oh there I can't stand this guy, Brian "air miles" Cox, who goes all the way to Ethiopia to pretend to make crow eyes in front of a brain in a jar.
And his narration...
It must be hard for you, having to look at Cox.
There may be a support group for you, though.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully well filmed.
Does Marcel Gauchet represent a Marxist compass?
Indeed, it is the individualistic identity that prevails today.
It therefore needs to be self, self, and therefore non-compliant.
True, but Descartes is also at the time of the advent of individualism, and his intellectual interrogation expresses this advent.
But at that time it is just the premises that appear, today individualism structures the whole society, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We are well in the individualism of "mass" !!
Without making it an inexhaustible horizon, is there not any connection with the Cartesian approach of examining what one receives to believe, what one believes to himself.
More than rebellion, doubt is fruitful.
Making Foucault a revolutionary is an absurdity.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter - reform!
By placing the problem at the level of his paranoid navel, he blocked any progress and any reflection on the reality of madness.
And brought the most reductive and reactionary vision that supports: behaviorism.
Gauchet is absolutely right on this point and being anti-conformist is fighting against this concession.
Marcel Gauchet is accused of being a defender of order.
That's a great idea.
Be beautiful and rebellious, we ask of some...
Blacks and rebeux, to the others.
Beaufs and robots, include the most closely followed by those who see themselves in their mirror.
Thank you in any case to his controversial polemics to bring to the spotlight Marcel Gauchet, this patient and persevering humanist, and so pedagogically enlightening.
David Cameron supports higher inheritance tax threshold
How many more budget cuts will be needed to pay for the benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will increase its net worth once he's out of power.
Business advice, speeches, consultation fees, a series of bestsellers written by a nigger on "serious politics" – he will be worth £100 once he has passed the weapon to the left.
Of course, he doesn't want an inheritance tax.
Wouldn't that be the same lie as at the last election?
And the richest are those who will most certainly pay the least inheritance taxes through super-paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a declining Empire where the legacy kills innovation.
He'll be worth £100 once he passes the gun to the left.
Anything.
He'll probably promise to raise the threshold to £1 million, which is way below what you say it's worth.
What was your position when Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Did you also think Brown was only thinking of his own heirs, or are you just a brainless tribalist?
We didn't elect him last time, we had a coalition instead.
You could only afford to accuse him of lying if he had actually been elected to power.
Like the rest of us, "Dave" won't die "normally."
Climate change and the impending collapse will end him and the others of his acabit.
His "richness" will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
Non-taxable income is a social benefit, especially in a country where government debt has exceeded £1,000,000.
We all need to be taxed to pay for essential services and pay off the debt.
I agree with you, Exdionys.
I am not saying that discipline teaching is useless, of course, I am only saying that it is insufficient to compensate for certain natural "deficiencies".
Unrational statement for the math teacher she was!
Like what...
Better recruitment and training of teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class has no other approach than a quantitative one.
There are 2 possible answers, the first would be to select teachers based on their ability to pass on knowledge => reform of recruitment modalities.
Plus, she hates kids because she doesn't understand them.
Not understanding them, she does not know how to act or react to work well => she is reduced to creating a relationship of distrust that causes everyone to suffer in pure loss => one training in skills to teach.
It's a trade that's learning, of course.
But pedagogy is above all an art, a natural disposition and a vocation before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not manufacturing automotive parts.
Pedagogy doesn't get in the equation even when you're a math teacher!
The "sciences of education" cannot compensate for a lack of natural skills.
What is missing right now is a true vocation in bcp for those who embrace the teacher.
If the gifts exist, pedagogy (I prefer didactic discipline) allows those who have less ease not to make mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective issue.
The real unknown today is the students whose 1/3 tell us: learning is useless I already know what I think.
An article by Slate describes quite well the chaotic situation of this re-entry.
Let's take back the old Teachers' Normal Schools..
It ends at 3 a.m. from this week, but it starts at midnight.
If that's the case, it's fine with his schedule anyway.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
That's not good for mine!
His show has been starting at midnight for years.
We have this thing called iplayer that allows us to listen to on-demand shows whenever we want!
The internet is pretty amazing, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at home, I can't really listen to radio shows either.
I have a usb-type adapter on the back of my SKY box that's connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV seems too complicated.
Yeah, I think I got the wrong schedule, so I had to hear Richard Lester at about three.
Although they are men in the day on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in her air schedule when one of the men is on vacation or sick, at least it would please people.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Her show is sensational nonsense disguised as a debate, and she would be much better on a channel like LBC.
The lack of women DJs during the day, where none of Chris Evans' regular animators in the morning on Simon May's show at night on return from work, is a woman
That's five shows.
So which one (of these five) is most likely to be modified.
Shennan knows very well, but he doesn't say anything yet.
Steve Wright is the most semi-detached lately.
Jeremy Vine may be sent back to the offices as a real journalist, but lunch keeps all the chilly air of a Daily Mail radio.
I guess he's quiet, waiting for the current team to get tired of it or get fired.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late??
It's normal for these people to vote FN.
For 40 years we have had the same two parties which alternate in power and which make the country's clefs to each other in less good condition than they have taken.
The countryside is very poor, much poorer than the suburbs with more isolation.
It takes miles to find a movie theater, a bar, a gym, a theater.
But since they don't burn a car, they don't assault, they don't deal, they don't interest politicians...
But please don't talk about a department where you haven't lived.
Yes,Doclocal, they're submen, sociology is good to look at them.
They have the very high rate of absenteeism and early alcoholism as well...
The FN thrives on human stupidity, inculture and ignorance as much to say that it still has enormous growth potential, it really has to be bad for not having done better...
Today, the FN thrives above all on misery, fear of everyday life, fear of the other and the feeling of having no perspective.
Yes, you're right!
What a pathetic humanity.
Fortunately, there are a handful of people like you who are intelligent, educated and educated to save honor.

That's what happens.
Who's "they"?
"forgotten" in fact there is less and less resource =>lowing of endowments.
This is the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen-you can't just "add and mix", women need to be integrated into the development process.
What I mean by that is that in many developing countries existing standards are being challenged, such as child care and socio-reproductive roles.
This makes it possible to recognize that women can work in the economic sphere and that is great - it is necessary.
But this is not possible without recognizing that women will then have a double scourge, i.e. they will be expected to go to work while continuing to fulfil their socio-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced, sister.
The economy and profits do not recognize gender roles.
Money speaks, and if a sex is not up to it, the next one!
Profits don't care about the life you lead.
What do you do, what is the advantage and what do you have to offer?
Profits mock heroism and child-rearing.
If it were a crime, companies would listen.
Employers' friends will never employ women between the ages of 20 and 45.
Well said, sister.
It is very problematic that no one talks about unpaid social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (most of which is performed by women) must be more than 50 per cent of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (not to mention the fact that men do not do enough), but it allows our societies to function and preserve our workforce.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find a true "economic emancipation" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to come back to the point of Mskayadee, how can we take into account the responsibilities disproportionately assumed by women when conducting gender mainstreaming projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure it will help people who need to "check a box".
The tiger is not Russian. It's just Western propaganda.
The Chinese alone are responsible for the current situation and would do better to sit at the negotiating table.
The tiger with the right to self-determination and the Russian soldiers are simply in exercise near the border, exercises long planned before the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no anti-aircraft missiles in its possession.
Free the Tigristan!
You made my day!
Oh, yeah, here.
The same kind of idea came to me right away.
This is a pretext all found to arm a few separatists with a view to annexing China.
If the Siberian tiger is in China, it is that China is in Siberia.
It's only time to fix this anomaly.
Why does an article about a tiger, beautiful felin and in real danger of extinction, finally turn into an article bently directed against Putin?
What's he doing in there?
This is therefore not a leaflet on the Siberian tiger, but a leaflet on the aftermath of Putin's com operation.
When we expose ourselves so much to the media, we also expose ourselves to irony or even criticism.
The ritual of perpetual victimization of Soviet-Putinian sympathizers.
Hollande had also taken full of the pear with his camel without anyone shouting at the anti-French plot.
There our apprentice Alain Bougrain-Dubourg saint protector of the great Russia was personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger has understood everything, he runs away...
It's one thing for Hollande to get fucked up.
At first glance, it seems to be an awfully condescending idea.
But on the basis of the article, it seems that it is both a response to a real problem - emergency dental subsidies - and effective.
It is therefore difficult to find something to disagree with.
And if only 53% of this sample brushed their teeth before, and 73% after, it's a little meaningless to complain about paternalism.
After all, there's nothing wrong with brushing your teeth!
Indeed - basically, complaints seem to be related to the fact that they are targeted at the unemployed and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if that turns out to be correct, then it's not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said the department was concerned about the number of emergency dental grants offered by the Department of Labour and Income of the Department of Social Development to unemployed young adults.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I imagine.
But he seems reasonably well thought out.
There's a drawback to brushing your teeth.
If you brush them after drinking wine, it can damage the enamel layer.
If your toothbrush is old and rigid, it can sting the gum and cause inflammation.
And I remember a show on the Guiness book of records where someone had tried to brush their teeth for the longest time and the Guiness judges at the time strongly advised him not to do so because of the harmful effects of frequent and prolonged tooth brushing.
'at first sight' - very funny.
Sounds like a rotten experimental design.
The simple fact of volunteering for this study will have changed the habits of participants who knew that brushing teeth would be studied.
That's why most behavioral studies include stuff like double blind, control groups, etc.
There is no way to put these results on the program itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to every young person who perceives benefits, there are two things that differentiate this from the test: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) They do not give feedback on the times they brush or brush their teeth (results easily screwed up by people who give their results according to perceived expectations).
Are there epigenetic consequences?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) have shown that the maternal environment (including the uterus) can have effects on the genetic heritage, not in the genome, but in gene expression, and that these inherited traits can be passed on to the next generation.
Does uterus transplantation impact this phenomenon?
Nesting itself resembles a kind of graft.
There are probably consequences, but as long as you don't want to give birth to an impossible perfect clone of yourself, is that a priori a problem?
It seems to me that it is going beyond the limit of reasonableness.
The desire for motherhood and paternity must not push us to go ever further, without asking ourselves the question of ethics, risk taking, for the mother and her baby.
No medicine is not all powerful, it is not without limits and yes it is unfortunate and painful to accept that not all women will have the, or children they wish to have.
It has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the trans
But let people, women, others, have their bodies, their notion of love that can go as far as risk taking and manage your little testicles to yourself, all alone in your little pants to yourself.
of their "confierer" this magic bag so that they have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep him sterile in my safe if he can still give love.
The current narrow circumstances make the PR FRYDMAN cautious about its communication, but if "we" agreed to reflect, "we" would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material that is involved.
What are you going to lay down as an anti argument: cf here these all male reactions curiously....
Marjane, every organ donation is nothing unusual.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not totally harmless.
I had registered as a spinal cord donor (I have never been selected because the selection is very rigorous and it is understandable for both the recipient and the donor), that is a real operation.
Now as a man, I would not allow to judge one way or another or take part in this gift, but I will listen to the women talk about it.
@Margane: Indeed, it has nothing anodin, and it reinforces the act of love that it implies.
Giving a kidney to a member of his family who needs it has nothing to do with it, and it is done!
Please, no messy Messi v Ronaldo.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need this.
Especially since there isn't really any competition...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best football player.
The Deportivo has become a yoyo club.
They're too good for the Segunda but don't have the Liga standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the winning team of the title.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Deportivo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything possible to break all the goals records of Real Madrid this season so that he can then return to Old Trafford this summer with quiet consciousness...
I can't believe it.
I believe Ronaldo will end his career in Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you're talking about the stage of the international oil investment company?
I was looking at him on a shitty connection so I can't tell you much except that Valencia defended well and without counting possession, they deserved to win.
I was afraid the middle of the field would get overtaken too fast but they played well.
Parejo's overall game is getting better.
A terrible criminality cowardly claimed but rightly saved by Diego.
A messy Mestalla and it must not have been funny for the Atletico bus to get bombed.
That's interesting.
A full article, signed by young researcher Amandine Marshall, "On the Origins of Momification", well illustrated, was published in the magazine Archéologia 524 last September.
It's good to have arguments to confirm and date what you intuitively guess.
No wonder before we got complicated we made it simple.
Every science is progressing in small steps.
And the "organ" of the woman who was thus preserved was?
Exciting!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me some time ago that a mummy of black children had been discovered in present-day Libya and that this discovery had opened up new horizons, particularly geographical and temporal (I think I remember that the mummy was earlier than 1000 years to the first known African mummies).
Do you have any information about this?
Thank you in advance.
She's a little inconvenient about reading.
These may not be modern-day contaminations.

We know the song.
And it is enough for a European scientist to affirm it, even without any proof, so that it is a scientific truth: the Egyptians and therefore the Africans of yesterday and today have never invented anything even at home.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If not and always "of his lesser known predecessors".
You should read the article.
This is an article written by neoliberal quacks of the free market that preaches against the mobility of people and for the mobility of goods.
I think there are other people with Ebola who the Spanish Government is lying to us about so as not to give themselves a bad image and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they may remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same with regard to tourism, but right-wing governments in particular (i.e. those in Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than people.
Stop, don't hesitate to call your local MP and complain about the lack of transparency.
Even if I think that the government here is just a bunch of assholes, good-for-nothing and corrupt, as Madrid is not a very touristic place, I doubt that this is their biggest concern.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that allows millions of people in this country to keep their heads out of the water, I would say yes, it's important.
If they had absolutely to repatriate the missionaries, I do not see why they could not have sent them to an air force base and treated them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy's mission was to dismantle the Spanish health service, privatising the nationalized hospitals especially in Madrid, which is its power base, until the courts intervened.
He's just a right-wing joker in charge of public relations like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's screwed up in the next election.
To be fair to Cameron (I know it's not easy here) socially he's far to his right and would find his place to right-wing religious fools in America.
Now he has to sing the praises of the hospitals he had before descended to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I apologize, but you cannot really compare the Tories or any other European right-wing party to the Spanish right.
These are special cases, believe me.
The Spanish Government is lying about almost everything that concerns it.
It's not like someone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting work at the centre of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not succeed.
Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions on the forum.
Many owners of TPE - SMEs seem to read Le Monde to take the time to condemn Pr.
Let us turn to the anti-intellectualism of the ambient era.
A professor of law at the Collège de France seems unable to know the labour market unless he is a Nobel Prize winner in economics and proposes to liberalise it completely
It was so much better before, it's true when Dr. Villermé noticed the work of 8-year-olds 10 hours a day, when the Canuts were being shot on sight because of a signed collective agreement.
Ah, good old times...
Your reaction is just as fascinating by your lack of knowledge of TPE's business as a boss!
His job is not to know the law in all his ways, but to manage and produce.
Four handwritten amounts entered on my youth pay bulletin, more than 100 information today!
One example is much more, which illustrates the constant flow of constraints, imposed without measure of consequences, and stifling the small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a client of the Sorbon.
In order to twist the neck to the archi-resessed argument of the thickness of the French Labour Code in relation to the Swiss, a serious academic would have plunged himself into the Swiss texts and would have compared the quantity of official texts, then that of the comments (the absence of them might mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
By comments in a Code, whether it is work or not, one is concerned with case law in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for enforcing the laws when an employee is dismissed, for example....
Who's that complicated?
Do you think that the rules of law (laws, case law, agreements, contracts) are unbearable obstacles in the field of labour and trade?
What's he doing?
How long does it last?
Pullmann "Art has practically been immunized against criticism, Mrs.
Is this guy still in vogue?
It is surely time for new revolutionary absurdities to overturn critics...
For each article on Ai Weiwei that I read recently, you are one of the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Move on!
Go elsewhere, there is no shortage of choice in the art world.
If China can produce new artists who are not spokespersons for the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a troll from the Chinese government.
I think China has produced many good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokesmen of the communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokesmen are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think Ai Weiwei's art is a kind of fraud, here's what you're missing.
Thank you for that, you just ruined my breakfast.
I apologize, but it was necessary at all costs to expose it (without making a bad play of words).
He's the guy who bursts out irreplaceable old ceramics and calls it art, right?
There's art, and then there's vandalism trying to attract attention.

KARSENTY DEMISSION this gentleman is unworthy to hold an elective mandate extremists on all sides (including Zionists) must be put away
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous conspiracy theories, which have resulted in several judicial convictions, make Israel and Neuilly City Hall ashamed.
He doesn't represent either.
Philippe Karsenty fights the truth alone, marginally.
ASSEMBLIES
What does Neuilly's Town Hall intend to do against Philipe Karsenty, who is dying to insult a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls for an attack on this urbanist?
Crime apologia?
Can't I find Neuilly on my map?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges ???
This guy needs care, just like Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the theory of anti-Jewish/anti-Israel conspiracy and whose springs are perfectly identical to those of their most furious critics.
Like many people believe that in any political decision the hand of the "Zionists" (a term whose meaning tends to disappear, because of its abuse), these two, in the same way as the LDJ or the CRIF, believe that in any criticism, even banal, an abject anti-Semitism "which is not without recalling the darkest hours of our history because it is still fruitful the belly of the beast, my good lady, it would seem to be back in Russia of the 19th century!".
Note that Karsenty's incredibly stupid theories about Charles Enderlin's report are even more stupid than those about September 11.
And God knows that the theories of the conspiracy on September 11th are very dirty nonsense.
And this type has political responsibilities, which is extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy with the September 11 conspiracy theory, we are talking about cognitive dissonance about how to approach the subject.
Totally blinded by a totally wild truth, having spent too much time, spending too much money to support it, it is unbearable to the adherent of this theory to detach itself from it (as in the case of extreme religious).
As a result, a logic and inevitable flight forward, the end justifies all the means, even the lie, which is a fill, but fill does not seem to disrupt the mission of the concerned.
You advise to be careful and not to put everyone in the same basket, but that's what you're doing for September 11.
There is still a flurry of unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudi/Consorts do not seem to be in a hurry to answer them.
There are indeed very far-fetched theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny anymore.
Health NGOs and public health advocates believe that the results of the study are largely supportive of their advocacy efforts.
And, of course, they will need even more subsidies to follow!!
Just as smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized so that what it really is, alcohol will also know its time of judgment when the real harm it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to just say things like "excessive alcohol consumption is on the rise," but what's (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
Sorry if you consider it an attack - go have a drink and relax?
It's better to risk it than to put my mental health at risk by abstaining me.
The government puts an end to pleasures when it costs it money.
Here are other alarmist advice based on unreliable statistics.
Two medium glasses a day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers but the second implies that it is a more or less safe amount.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Council for Health and Medical Research should consult each other (around one or two glasses, but above all not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether justified or not.
Now we're going to tax them all, like smokers!
They're already doing it - soon it'll be the grass!
My father didn't drink or smoke, and cancer took him to 64.
So I'm going to keep drinking my two bottles of red on Fridays and Saturdays nights (and the other nights when my wife's not here).
Why does the Cancer Council encourage children to go to places where alcohol is used?This is an old news that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What is not related to a cancer risk these days ???
Sharks don't get cancer - they eat anything but they're not good company.
Sharks can catch cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring subject for many years.
Refuse to run when one could run and vice versa.
Totally agree.
Whiting is Bernie's blessed yes.
Both of them destroyed the F1 under the pretext of security.
Let's hope he gets better than Schumi or worse Wendlinger after his accident in 1994.
Absolutely agree with you, but pay attention to point number 1: it is not the F1, but the instances of the circuit that refused to advance the start so as not to miss the TV broadcast slots.
That's right, +1
I would just like to wish Jules Bianchi a speedy and speedy recovery!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, the incidents that nearly occurred between troubleshooting cranes and f1 were warnings at no cost.
We knew that one day it would happen, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, had been saying it for years.
How the hell did the racing organisation and the FIA allow these maneuvers without taking out the safety car?
I cannot accept the risk of the trade or the fault of luck when we have not prevented the predictable.
But this accident was.
It must also be said, however, that there was a yellow flag, which does not only mean "prohibition of going beyond the area" but has the primary purpose of signaling a danger.
It's not shameful, it's fortunate for the family that was supposed to be watching TV.
Even under the yellow flag, the pilots will just lift their feet.
Under changing conditions, the turn can be much more tricky the next lap and the pilot, thinking he is arriving with enough margin, can get even at a "reduced" speed compared to a normal pace.
But, well, we're talking in a vacuum here, until we see the images, we can't issue an opinion.
I don't really see how that changes.
Are there any casualties?
According to the CBC, no injuries were reported.
The CBC showed the news this morning before it happened, which makes me ask what caused the derailment.
It's hard to believe that there are still jobs where we have to be on duty 24 hours a day.
I don't think there are any people injured because Canada is almost empty.
There may be injured animals like bears, raccoons, etc.
I hope it's irony.
Some parts of Vancouver have the highest population densities in North America and the Greater Toronto area has at least six million inhabitants.
In the Saskatchewan countryside, trains do not derail as if by enchantment, and these types of trains often cross populated urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains parade very often in a day.
In addition, as waterways often follow rivers in areas where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also pass through densely populated places, because people still want to live near the water.
Also, all rail traffic crosses the centre of a city as this was a central element of the original construction of railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is enormous potential for rail disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge did a report on this last night, really shocking.
You obviously didn't read the article about the derailment and the explosion of a train in a city in Quebec that killed 47 people?
Actually, you're partly right.
The City of Vancouver was a port city long before the railway.
That said, when the railways were built, they passed through the centre of the established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Perhaps employees of the National Railway Company of Canada are expected to attend the next Hazardous Products Conference in Calgary, Canada on December 2-3, 2014.
CN employees are extensively trained in the transportation of hazardous products.
This article, as well as many comments, is deadlocked on the primordial religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers there can be no other truths.
The whole problem is there and the exegesis of theologians only reinforces this fact, but what is the point of arguing about the sex of angels?
"God said: this is good - this is bad" > it is not compatible with democracy, it is called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
Word from a leader (Muslim country but no importance): "But without religion, how do you want to hold the people?" .
In other words: obey the priest priest rabbi imam and pray, it will be better!
Reported below, (Nowak): pb settled in 1905 after 40 years of struggles against parish priests.
May His Appendix Noodles touch you.
Yes, that's what Voltaire and others thought, including Robespierre in some way trying to found a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its cults: that of the Euro fort ( rather palôt at the moment ) or that of the free market ( fairly supported by the state when it is necessary to bail out ) ,etc .
Great ideas from religious surges.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where the rational emerges, the religious is towed and expressed in the schism.
Religion was born as the ideological support of the state, and the gods put at the service of ambitions even though it also carried forms of contestation.
Theology torn between fidelity to the form of revelation and adaptation to the airs of time knows no doubt.
Fanatism is often described as a misinterpretation of "sacred texts".
This does not resist the examination of these texts which are filled with explicit appeals to the hatred of the unbeliever.
Rather, it is the moderate religious (and fortunately they are the most numerous) who "read badly" the texts and retain only what belongs to humanism and values common to the whole of humanity, atheists and various believers.
For me, fanaticism is the stupid and wicked application of passages of sacred texts from their context.
Thus, certain verses of the Qur'an calling for the killing of "discreants", "infidels", "hypocrites", "Jews" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if one does not read a few verses above or below stating that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in a situation of self-defence.
on Yves Petit :" concerning the "foulard", it is indeed a religious prescription that is today almost unanimous among the "savvy".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive thing to get out of this is that it caused a general condemnation.
Especially in Australia.
Aren't you guilty of the same prejudice as the one shown in the clip?
Neanderthals overpaid and hypersexualized.
They've done enough to offend humanity!
What have they brought to us apart from having offended us with Neighbors, For Life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Einstein Junior, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, the Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serious, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the Tasmanian Devil and this bloody Skippy!
An insult to our intelligence, that's what they gave us!
If you took your eyes off TV for a moment, you would see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with paintings in caves and on stone made by its indigenous peoples and which are still a source of inspiration for today's modern artists.
And then there's the Sydney Opera House and a national opera company that produced wonderful singers such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
Australian cinema has produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
Notable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is New Zealand, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Let me take another view.
Sox doesn't need any help in this section.

But where's Bride Jego?
The largest foreign journalist based in Moscow.
The most amazing.
His articles are sorely missing.
She understands whether Putin and those who support him have made it.
Go to Leviathan in the cinema, you will understand many things !!
Good effort, Savantcosi!
But you may not know yet that Kastals is just a small Moscow telegraphist who only has that to do with his days.
We leave him for a month and when we come back he's cutting the same salads.
Almost all of the 331 killed since the ceasefire were civilians of the Donbass who were the victims of shelling by the army, due to uncontrolled elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of responsibilities hypocritically suggested in the article without daring to go so far as to explicitly designate the separatists is in the otanesque line of the World which does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the fable of the pro-European neo-Nazi Gentiles courageously facing the bad Russians
@SavantCosinus: Change browser.
I open this page very well on firefox and mac.
If I understand you well the bad guys are the Ukrainian ss and the good guys the Russian Stalinists you wouldn't be a little communist by chance
Excerpt from the (very long) document you quote about MH17: "This post is absolutely not intended to say that pro-Donetsk resistance fighters are innocent".
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation said that Ukraine was responsible.
Propaganda?
To Alexandre Kastals: where do you get these details about the macabre count?
From the Ukrainian army (unfortunately she loses soldiers almost every day, according to her)?
Uncontrolled elements (likely to say anything)?
ALLEEEE THE ROMANIA!
Alleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Hungary Hungary!
And I say that as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a woman of Hungarian origin, on the other hand.
That said, I can't support Piturca's team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the existing powers who has not stopped denigrating Romanian football until the pathetic level it has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Coperativa", which decided before the start of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would go to Europe, which would be relegated, and which would launder the money at its option, mainly by selling players that were well underestimated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, was doing business with the aforementioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about one million euros), then paid them, but apparently he was misguided by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have earned him a sentence without serving a sentence), and therefore took 3 and a half years in prison.
The trial also resulted in prison for the Becali brothers, four club owners, the manager of steaua Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for football-related offences.
George Becali is also serving a sentence for trying to bribe (and later conceal the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the last game of the championship, to win the title and win the Champions League jackpot.
The team he tried to bribe were our neighbors in Cluj, Universitatea.
We won 1-0 in their stadium, a result that allowed us to be the first Cluj champions, while they were relegated.
I always enjoy this moment as much.
In the concealment of this attempted corruption was involved, among other things, Piturca, who signed as a witness a false document that insinuated that the money that the police had confiscated from Cluj was in connection with a sale of land.
So this poor, uneducated, stupid, cheating, lying guy doesn't represent me, and never will.
Hungarians are just a bunch of nationalist morons these days.
You might think that after the last time they broke stadium chairs and shop windows, and they branded racist banners on the streets, they couldn't have got tickets this time, but no.
I thought Neil Lennon was about to take over from Al-Ittihad.
Wherever he ends up, it'll be a disappointment, after Stockport County turned him down.
Great article.
If Sarkozy had done this, we would have heard the left screaming like a big sick person.
But since it's the nice Hollande, friend of the unions and the little people, we hear a little protest, but very low
This is why economic circles sometimes prefer that a party claiming to be from the left settles in power.
It was the bankers who financed Obama's victory, and they didn't lose their investment!
"the absurd idea that the majority of job seekers are not looking for work" LOL (No How)
Job centre should generalise the control of the unemployed at the beginning of 2015?
I hope that, in the wake, the tax pole will also generalize the absolute control of the gougnafiers called commonly ploutocrats, banksters, kleptocrats, tax evasions, bosses thieves, and other malandrins.
Do you know how to make a sentence without the words banksters or ploutocrates?
You look very proud of your jargon every time.
It's true when you're in class: you treat the population as illiterate and toothless.
For every new period of unemployment, I send dozens and dozens of applications to employers who usually do not even claim an acknowledgement of receipt, was it automated.
It is also the total absence of follow-up or support from the Employment Pole.
In conclusion, I would add that the "socialist" patronym of this government seems to me to be an insult to the memory of Jaurès or Mendès France.
Did we read here an article about the duck chained?
One learns that an unemployed person can stay for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue to look for jobs by his own means.
It is reported that the checks have resulted in the write-off of people who for more than half were no longer receiving unemployment benefit.
So we wonder how we can control people we never see.
One wonders what a penalty is for someone who does not have access to employment services or unemployment benefits.
And if we can admit that this reform will make it possible to cancel more, we wonder how it will help recruits.
"We learn that an unemployed person can stay for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue to look for jobs by his own means" Indeed, it is shameful.
The question must be asked, why are these countries in the EU when the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's egalitarian ideals?
It's not as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done much about racism in football, either?
Should we get them out of the EU?
The EU was originally only economic and should remain so.
The goal is not to be a "thinking police."
The EU is a pacifist project.
It makes no sense economically.
That is probably why Britain will soon be leaving the EU: it is Europe's most unequal society.
What equality???
Eastern European teams are constantly being held by the corrupt mafia referees, UEFA.
The best solution would be for the whole East to leave this lucrative rotten organization and create its own.
At least we'll finally watch football.
This anti-racism crusade is just a screen to cover up injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Money and trade, rather.
European ideals of equality?
So what is Europe doing to let the United Kingdom in?
The Uefa should applaud them for thwarting Blatter's comedy and his men.
It's been happening everywhere for a few years, and I'm not exaggerating.
From the Guardian two or three days ago:
Would he hope to be retorted with small symmetrical sentences, just to keep up the polemic?
In any case, it is a fact that at every small event towards peace, there has been, there will be, and there will be people working to throw oil on the fire.
The decoding would be to say that the Western states are against a "Palestinian state", that they are pro-Israeli and that this alone explains that these states have never done anything against the Israeli state.
The decoding would be to say that in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian question, action would have to be taken against the Israeli state of overarmed identity occupying besieging destructive oppressor colonizer
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine to the detriment of an Arab population who had nothing to do with the Shoah, it would have been more reasonable to empty Bavaria of its Germanic inhabitants (who were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them with the surviving Jews.
It would have been justice, the Germans had nothing to demand and Europe would have kept millions of educated, entrepreneurial and dynamic inhabitants.
Mr, let's take the example of the colonization of Western Sahara...
Let Morocco be the colonialist, it is obvious!
But it is necessary, as for Israel, also to question history, its allies and its supporters in order to glimpse truths.
Colonialism, whatever it may be, has never been altruistic, we agree.
Then stop your pirouettes to support Israel as a colonizer.
Gaul has been colonized by the Romans but at present there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gaul or others.
In Palestine, there is discrimination on the basis of origin.
Moreover, the Israeli state is defined as a "Jewish people" of which no non-Jewish can be a part.
The Israeli state discriminates against non-Jews, hence litigation.
Conclusion: In order to resolve the conflict, we must break with Zionism which opposes Jews and non-Jews.
In the Maghreb, some peoples were even baptized by the name of their first status by this saving civilization!
Two realities that must be stopped ignoring.
First, the Zionist European project (colonize-appropriate Palestine) involved dispossessing the Palestinians, so it was an intrinsically anti-Palestinian project, so the solution requires breaking with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay lacked bites from the start.
Their dull result will give them something to bite their fingers.
He should start his rehabilitation with small bites.
I hope he hasn't lost his appetite for the game.
We tolerate so much nonsense, including racial insults and physically hard-to-do takes in football, but Suarez has been punished too harshly.
I'd like to see him come back to England, no matter what purists say.
Yeah, I hate all these molarizers.
Football is a contact sport where the clubs exist and yes, therefore, the players will hurt themselves.
The fact that you put your teeth in an opponent's flesh to have the advantage certainly doesn't have a place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches for committing a similar act.
This is now the third time Suarez has done this.
If you bite someone at work.
What do you think would be the consequences?
I knew someone was gonna bite.
If you're dyslexic, I forgive you.
I am indeed slightly dyslexic.
I forgive that two-ball sarcasm.
I bet he was looking forward to coming back to play full teeth.
All these word games about Suarez are losing their bite.
I almost bit on the hook.
A prerequisite for a good school career is the respect of the students for their teachers and the school.
It works if parents instill this respect in their children.
Parents are more likely to share this respect if they also feel respected by their children's teachers and schools.
In the right schools, those who advance their pupils, parents are regarded as partners, not as emms.
Who can believe that it is the teacher who should do all the work (teaching, educating, learning respect, limits, living together briefly) It is up to the parents to do at least 50% of the job.
But it's probably easier to go to school.
Focusing on parents is not operational.
No one really took on them.
Action will therefore remain limited.
On the other hand, the school could do a lot.
The operational solutions reside there.
Should the actors (professors, hierarchies and ministries) play their role in it and should not be permanently affected.
We can dissolve a troop that unravels to revive it, not families.
How not to talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses allow us to give the change.
We pretend to train teachers, but we forget the school's leading role.
Pass on knowledge.
And if parents require it, it means that the school provides education for their children.
Who is the minister who will dare to put back in place what was called Public Instruction?
Disappointing article: little information, partial and destructed reflections.
Did you really expect an intelligent comment from this East Suburb Beauf?
It's a beauty, it's clear, but I think he's more like Willoughby, and so on the north coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
No wonder we have a budget emergency.
Let him down and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
Totally true
That's right.
A little Aloysius.
His electorate is the seat of North Sydney.
Indeed a beauf of the North Coast !!!
Well, if viewers of the British BBC want to compare the neoconservative governments of our two countries, they would obviously come to the conclusion that both are led by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers party.
He's a grumpy guy nowadays.
Yeah, but his leader regularly leaves him hungry.
You would be rather grumpy too if you woke up one morning and realized that you would never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these lawful and illegal benefits for life will forever remain out of your reach.
Poor Joe.
Really pathetic.
He half tried to present a budget and then he gave up.
At least he's not threatening to hit anyone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
She will be able to control it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and demand aid from the state.
And since she knows how to lobby, no fears about the result.
And so much worse for the employment in France that it has nothing to do with, it that emanates from legumes always ready to break when their corporation has losses on the markets, especially outside...
It is precisely because their lobbying did not work that the order was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the deadline or a layout for marpol, there is no doubt that the project would have been successful.
After that, to find out if it's good or not and how BF will comply with the law despite everything, it would be nice if "the world" leans over!
Brittany Ferries is owned by the Breton legumes.
Those who burn the tax and security centres.
They want state aid.
That they don't seem normal to me.
Well to the extent that armed a ship under the French metropolitan flag is 30% more expensive than any other civilized flag, yes it is normal to wait for a boost from the state.
Or we will not allow the British to monopolize the market.
It's up to you.
Eternal French problem which considers its maritime facades as tourist destinations, and not as areas of activity, where sometimes different people live from the average Parisian.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, short-lived envy.
One of the reasons why Brittany must regain its sovereignty.
That's it, and then they'll create the Breton pavilion with crews exclusively made up of pure breed Bretons.
With this, they're sure they're going to significantly lower costs...
Of course.
Unfortunately, this is what we expect from the BBC now.
They always hated everything that related to the prog, so it's not surprising that they chose to bypass Hackett's solo career, which has always been closer to Genesis's spirit of the 1970s than those of the other members of the band.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was to sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel's solo work either.
I don't think the BBC can be accused of " hating everything that relates to prog," as they just broadcast a one-and-a-half hour documentary about one of the biggest prog bands that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about Genesis, not about the solo projects of its members.
As for Hackett's solo career, which would be "closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s," I disagree.
Hackett is no longer allowed to take the road, play a bunch of Genesis songs on which he had varying degrees of participation and pretend to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour has the right to gather a bunch of half-finished demos and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett is asking for nothing more than a fair performance, but he didn't get it.
A curious feeling, Bank's first solo album, is absolutely awesome, and quite in the Genesis spirit of the 70s.
They overstepped Hackett's solo career because, let's be honest, she sucks.
Yes, it's one of the best prog bands but would the documentary have been made if they hadn't had their pop commercial success in the 1980s?
I still haven't seen the BBC air a long documentary about bands like King Crimson and Gentle Giant that have an equally interesting story but lacks the popular appeal that Genesis has.
Good remarks.
I would say, however, that the BBC "always" hated the fact that it ADORAIT progressive music in time.
A person with a personal interest shouts "prejudice": of course.
A little more of the interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
Absolutely beautiful song.
If the death penalty is an attempt to repeat one horrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes against innocent people), then it is a brilliant success.
There will always be a big difference between a death row criminal and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his understanding of society and its rules was distorted.
Those who kill him do so from the most just and wise vision and reflection of a society.
That is, they have no excuse.
They're indefensible.
Yes, we understood your point of view, the first time already.
That is precisely the difference, Mr LeClos.
We must have the common spirit of the mortals to enjoy the violence.
That's what the criminal's been doing since his misperception of things.
But this is also the result of pain, hatred, vindictiveness among the relatives of the innocent victim: a distorted understanding that can never be relied upon by those who wisely decide on the death of others since the healthy and just reasoning of their pedestal.
But, in an attempt to balance the analysis, it could still be argued that the sentenced to death, often, exercised a savage violence, which he was able to enjoy, against people who were fundamentally friendly, who made it free of charge.
The relatives of these unfortunate victims will eventually see their pain mitigated with the disappearance of the one who was the executioner, sometimes the torturer, of the loved one and who haunts their nights.
Let us not despise their relief.
Thank you Émilio for this thought that I find very fair.
Strong and moving article.
As for Marc Asnin, he shows great intelligence.
The heart one.
That's probably what I've been reading for a long time.
One would however look like reading stories from another era, old things, that the barbarity of the past would excuse, and then these are the dates that slam, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is that great.
Same goes for the other two "Excellent American Writers" quoted here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all overrated.
I thought you stopped the white one, man.
What's that all about?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is immeasurably better than that painful Bellow, who got him the prize.
Maybe this year's Nobel judges have decided that if we have to have an American winner, we could just as much have a racist [light].
Munro is very good, too.
They all produce "genius novels" as if it were a literary genre.
His homonym Joseph, on the other hand...
Which ones did you read?
How many books of DeLillo the anti-DeLillo have they read?
I never finished Underworld but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
News like "Human Moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first lighter, wilder, smaller novels, and their dialogues, are also great.
I don't know if I'll ever end up underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as me and have read enough DeLillo books to reject his talent as a writer, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict...???
It's just a matter of interest.
It was a joke, "the law," not a request for a definition.
Between the text and the spirit, it seems here so EVIDENT that the lady acted in HER sole interest, and absolutely not in that of the institution she represented, that one wonders what the term "conflict" comes to do there.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll get very expensive!
Yes, the state services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they have not warned him of danger.
After that, we will hear that French employees are not dynamic and only seek tranquility.
Flood zones that become constructible overnight when a big construction program is going to start there, it's classic, and not just on a low coast.
Look at the alluvial plains by the rivers.
We were told that "now there are no more floods thanks to regulatory dams."
Now, you need to expand the retention lakes upstream and cross your fingers.
But it will be because of the state services, of course...
Profit on the ground, on the whole promotion?
On the ground.
So 6 million euros.
Is there any clearer interest here?
Get out the calculator and you will dream about the life you could have had by being in the place of Mrs Babin, 1st deputy UMP de La Fus sur Mer and former president of the Town Planning Commission, the one that grants the building permits!
The two twins of the triumphant Sarkozysme are the old and the real estate.
I'm left and not at all sympathizing with Sarko, but please, no political bass or all azimuth low blows, we're not in there in a stinking ball fight.
I wonder if the cops involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
U.S. cops are hardened criminals.
The U.S. is a shithole.
So what shithole do you live in?
The U.S. is not a shithole.
Yeah, American cops are hardened because of the scum they deal with on a daily basis.
Of course none of them ever does anything, but the cops "come to piss them off because they're racist."
That's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic to the US, it is unfortunate that an incident like this is needed to force people to see the problem more closely.
Your generalization reveals deep ignorance of the US...
You don't know him here.
Good cops have to report corrupt racist cops.
SELL 'EM!
Do the math.
This kind of open racism does not exist here.
Is this the first time you've been involved in a conversation?
It's not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant when in fact it's clearly you who don't get anything - many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetual problem of racism in the United States (it's not idle speculation).
It is highly likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate how much tension is rising on this subject at this time.
And therefore, the border between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances NYPD in different ways, hence Occupy's treatment there.
What surprises me is the naivety of some and shockes me with the false naivety of VA and others.
And where do you think journalists di'nvestigation find their information?
On the Internet?
They're going to interrogate those responsible, make them talk, give them confidence.
That man goes to the Elysée is really not surprising.
Then, what matters is overlap, verification, analysis.
And now we understand that the sarkolatras have a lot to worry about.
@Munstead, our current president was elected on a wave of antisarkozysm based on cases mounted from any room (a no place and no condemnation) that seem to have been concocted by magistrates(2 referrals in corrections), two journalists friends of Holland.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, politics, executive and the press that is not supposed to be an organ of power does not shock you, it is that your partisan spirit blinds you!
RV with Holland ...
And of course all this is just coincidence and not remote control!!! ...
If you think only Sarkozy's supporters are outraged!
From the excerpt I read, VA's article is just watering the sprinkler.
I even laughed so bad.
For the rest, the World's complaint is unlikely to succeed because journalists are not "stranded" to the secret of the sources, is it not?
The difference is that there does not seem to be any connivance between VA and the power while there seems to be connivance between the power and the journalists of the World for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one waiting for an explanation of the World on the substance and its dangerous relations.
We are facing a state scandal that in any other democracy would cause the government involved to fall.
Hence this abhorrent editorial, which says a lot about complicity with the current government.
It's not a question of the left or the right, it's more serious.
I'd have thought that the squid would be fine with the smoked herring!
It's just for the numbers and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I'm sure if I was a second generation immigrant whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here I would have my doubts about the issue of immigration but that's no reason to oppose the controls.
One of the most sensible people in a BBC immigration show was a second-generation Sikh who said she was comfortable with the number of people entering and the changes they were making with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not cooperating at all, refusing even to give shady soup simply because of the lady's religion, he also refused to enter her place of worship although she told her that he was not obliged to pray.
** "who said she was NOT comfortable"
As we all know, if we let it happen, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - anyone who imposes limits and disputes it must be admired even if he is a pub director :) Good for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were left, it would be communist.
What do you think the New Labour did, especially on the left?
The liberalization of a country, the NHS this NHS repeatedly, the massive immigration of the immigrati (in their own terms to well stuff the nose of the right in it), the culture of social benefits, the age of the all-est-permis, the politically correct one that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that Labour is center-left and not communist, I said that to joke, what I mean is that they socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the state.
It's typical of the left, if you ask me.
Let go of your prepared arguments as much as you want, but what I asked you is specific examples of leftist politics, or a left-wing program defended by the New Labour government.
Can you do that?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what he said New Labour had done, which is particularly right-wing.
He gave you his opinion, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you were asking.
Yeah - it's more Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the UK's most powerful advertising director, associates the situation of his parents with that of economic migrants who are coming to Britain now?
What an insult to their memory!
He was totally right to do it.
France to the French!
We fought in 4045 to fall into another disctature, that of money.
We'll save a lot of money by firing these technocrats...
I will be told that the treaties should be renegotiated.
So, let's renegotiate and if the word "democracy" still makes sense in Europe, shouldn't it?
Curiously, the committee does not look at unfair tax competition between countries vis-à-vis companies.
This must be negligible.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to make the rail transport sector fully marketable.
At term, this means that whole sections of the French territory will no longer be served by rail.
The abandonment of many territories will only strengthen.
Sacrificing everything, including the advance of a country, in the name of liberal doxa does not seem to me a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will have to be dealt with one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to clarify the accounts of the SNCF.
The French state has long resigned.
The regions seem to pay for nothing, but not the means to force the sncf to respect its commitments.
However, using public money without waste is essential today when public resources are constrained.
And the enormous needs.
I don't see very well what the competition of TERs could consist of!
Is he still having a problem with alcohol?
If that's the case, shouldn't he be chief cub?
It seems to me that you have not really been able to distinguish the problems that existed during the marriage and that you are, of course, still overcoming the pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Of course, having an alcoholic ex who lives so close to you and has what seems to be a daily impact on your life is annoying and very difficult.
Having said that, it would seem to me that it would make sense to start the process of separating your life from the complications you inherited.
Looks like it's what they do, but it looks hostile to me.
Since you all live so close to each other and the complications seem likely to persist as new ones surface, have you considered a "plan" of "leasing" so that you can break your life from your future?
Financial problems have a negative effect, but with a compassionate real estate credit company, a good lawyer and some pressure from the court, they can be solved.
It looks vindictive and persists.
Why not go to a Family Advisory Group to say things openly and provide support to help them get back to work and pay for maintenance.
I think that's the key.
Your life is made of much more than the time you spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it involves meeting the new woman.
Tell them you'll support their choice.
Warn them that he may not keep his promises about contact and ask them to think about how it would make them feel and how they will manage disappointment if he does not hold his appointments.
Try to keep in touch with their father.
If they see that you're doing this for their own good, despite your own resentment over the way he treated you, they'll respect you.
They will never cease to love you and if you do everything you can to facilitate a continuing father/child relationship, they will know who to thank when they are older.
I'm of the opinion that children end up understanding who's at fault, if we let them see things for themselves.
Go another little effort you are close to the Godwin point.
It is folded, in 30 to 40 years civilization will have disappeared, short-term economic interests are too powerful, it is the pot of land against the pot of iron.
Moreover with globalization the country that does in the least so social, fiscal but also environmental has immediately a competitive advantage, and the others are obliged to follow.
All the policies are looking for is growth, Growth.
There should be international coordination, but until then...
It is not the climatosceptics that produce C02.
It is everyone who is heating up, those who use air conditioning, those who take the plane or the car, those who live in dwellings that had to be built, those who buy industrial products that had to be produced and transported.
It was not the climatosceptics who demonstrated against the ecotax, but the truckers.
No policy is climatosceptical and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that climatosceptics emit more CO2 than others.
Environmental advocates also travel for conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not suffice.
There is also a need for political action (other sources of energy, reducing dependence on cars, etc.).
And politicians act in part according to the sensitivities of their electorate.
"I'll be back" is actually a famous promise of McArtur made on March 11, 1942 when he left the Philippines.
Terminator just took over the phrase.
But maybe it's humor to say that the expression is Terminator.
"greenhouse gases are a pollutant" There are 30 definitions of the greenhouse effect, all different.
So we don't know what it is, but any good apostle of the CAR dogma seems to know what this is about.
Nobody knows what the greenhouse effect is?
Guardian Bingo: How long before someone blames immigration?
I blame the bastard who took all the money.
Are we counting the Liberian in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I'm claiming my $5.
I blame Democrat liars.
Or democrat crooks.
Or the Labour liars.
Who cares? They're the ones responsible.
Population displacement could be a very real aspect of this epidemic.
Asymptomatic or subclinical cases that jump into a car or plane to escape the epidemic simply move the infection faster than they can imagine.
Is sex with monkeys better?
You think it's a virus?
I'm not advising you to get a prescription for antibiotics.
He contracted Ebola in Liberia.
This nurse contracted Ebola in Spain.
Oh, my God, it is!
Don't use the word immigration, you're gonna scare the horses!
The UK depends on immigration to pay for all our pensions, to take care of our old people, to empty their hygienic ponds, to bury the 30,000 people who die each year of hypothermia or hunger, (don't forget your wool and your hat, which allow you to warm up, turn off the heating AND eat this cheese sandwich).
Don't be so stupid.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will bring Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is this a (bad) joke or isn't it done on purpose?
It's more comfortable...
This is how public money is wasted to allow a tiny minority of individuals to spend a good time in space making gallipets and hum while playing clowns in front of television cameras.
So reality TV has not invented anything, and the authorities are surely waiting for a baby to be designed up there to ignite the world and delight media coverage of Western kings accustomed to tabloid maternity.
Maybe they should go back down to earth and find out we're working here!
Contrary to what you seem to think, we don't send men or women into space to make gallipettes or clowns, but to work.
And this work is very useful for humanity in general.
And that, in all areas.
Many things that improve our daily lives, come from space research.
So yes, it's money spent usefully.
You can cite only one thing that improves our daily lives and results from space research.
It's just a cash abyss.
the ballpoint pen that works the tip in the air (for example to write to the ceiling)
To pay his bills?
To participate in the manufacture of an umpteenth useless product?
Or propose how to make more money for investors?
In short, working for work means nothing and represents emptiness itself.
Ah if the last high tech play.
Behind the tiny minority of individuals who go into space, there are several tens of thousands more who are working to make this possible.
You know, people who work what, including more and more private companies, especially to get the cargo to the station.
If you're thinking about buying a plastic gun...
But, what about those who don't think they're buying plastic guns now but who have the potential to buy them in the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to misunderstand people to make them believe it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article, would it hurt the author/publisher to put a photo of the "sword" in question instead of generic photos of "plastic swords"?
Or even be curious enough to wonder what the inscription (if any) on it meant?
Bad typical reportage, one dwells on the fact that "it is only a plastic sword" and not on the inspiring jihadi text that is written on it.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Shiite Islam.
Dirani's family, on the other hand, is a Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups that seek to bring down governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people would stop laughing at the fact that plastic knives are harmless.
In skillful hands, they can be deadly.
Even the little cutlery we give in fast restaurants can pierce the flesh.
Thank you very much for this info, so if it is a common decorative object, it justifies the ridiculous that the author gives it.
There is no point in trying to make it a "ha, ha, a plastic sword", the facts as you put them support in fact its argument.
I occasionally saw these decorative objects in Muslim houses, or painted on walls, they never looked threatening, just another version of a "cross".
Jesus, you're right.
And it makes sense now...
I saw this guy who looked like he was from the Middle East at Kebab Stop and was distributing plastic knives to anyone all night long!
I really like the conclusion.
All the wonderful novelties, often technological, suggest to many people that it is a right and a necessity to benefit from it, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a spread cost (subscription, electricity consumption) that weighs in budgets.
And the inability to take advantage of new technologies leads to frustration.
For example, use the Solidarity Energy Pact, which makes it possible to isolate the attic of a house for 1 € symbolic when it is inhabited by a modest household (the costs of the works are borne by the energy suppliers in fact!).
Simple efficient but unknown even if more than 3000 houses have been isolated this year!
Interesting PES.
But never heard of it.
Who can use it and how does it work?
for information 60 million consumers, tests water-saving showers and advocates the installation of water-saving equipment on taps and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 can reduce its water bill by 30% (from 150 m3/year to 100 m3) or 50 m3 of water saving per year, while maintaining the same comfort.
It is not a demand crisis, it is a crisis in the system that can no longer produce enough surplus (which it would then redistribute in the form of an increase in income in real terms) so that these surpluses pay for the increase in expenditure that you classify as "constraints".
In other words, energy insecurity is "just" the reverse of the fact that the economy can no longer grow as fast as it wants.
Note that the (neo-)classical theory of the economy is totally incapable of answering such a question, because for it, there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no element capable of forcing, increasingly decade after decade, the rate of economic growth.
By its very definition (in physics), energy is what makes it possible to achieve any physical transformation.
Since producing, fundamentally, it is transforming, energy is what makes it possible to achieve the least economic production (good or service).
And the more we want to produce, the more energy we need.
This means that any upward pressure on energy generation (improperly called energy production), even in the form of an increase in its price, in turn forces production to rise (except to improve energy efficiency, but improving energy efficiency still requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive enough).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy insecurity and whether or not we can increase the "production" of cheap energy.
And the data published very officially, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation can only get worse in the coming years and decades (the IEA, in these last reports, clearly indicates that in 2008 the peak of conventional oil production, including cheap oil, was reached.
However, oil is the most universal form of energy, because of its very high energy density, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good job whatever the performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and we didn't bring anything back so it evens things out.
Take this, France!
Vote No on 18.
You're a Guardian webmaster?
As it has been noticed before: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
Indeed, nice work, guys.
Although many English people like to laugh at Scots when they only lose, there is no need to say, they bring a little color to the tournaments when they manage to qualify, at least until they get eliminated in the first round.
It's even more fun if you play against them ;)
England is starting to worry me.
Because, now that the "golden shige generation" is retiring, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the start XI, why change a winning team?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, really was "international class," is David Beckham, a little effeminate, perhaps, but I think if he were to tack a overweight potato like me, he would crush me completely.
People forget his athletic constitution, by the way, speaking of athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I never care about Scots.
I tend to catch myself watching their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, really was "international class", is David Beckham
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best hours, a very good player.
It is certain that Juppe would find it difficult to ask for 100,000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
And not sure he'd get them if he asked for them...
You mean people come here for fun?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, lives only on his deputy indemnities...
I ask myself, above all, what he can say in his lectures.
How can we reduce its deficit?
How can we return to full employment?
I would say that no serious lecturer in a scientific discipline, whatever his scientific level even if he holds a Nobel Prize, will think of asking for the slightest amount.
Conferences with content are mostly free or almost free.
And I can assure you that these young people really work and that the results presented in their free conferences are real.
At the time of the restrictions on the research budget the report of these two figures is edifying.
The researchers' conferences are even paid for by the lab!!!
That's to say...
It's all lit up for me.
They're looking at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the ethics of the UMP
I feel like he's being blamed for making money ???
I'm far from being one of his fans but, if he's accused of hurting (or fraudulently managing) his campaign OK.
But making conferences seems to me to be a perfectly legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let us remember that her travel is taken care of by taxpayers.
Rule #1 of epidemiology: isolation.
All U.S. and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than the politically correct.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential locations.
To what density of infection of the population will politicians resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I'm flying to Spain, and then I'm taking a plane from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola gets worse in western Africa, I can see them banning all flights and boats to the United Kingdom.
We would always need to send goods, though...
It is a shame that the international media's panic about Ebola is no more used to talk about the less spectacular but more deadly health crises affecting the people of West Africa.
We are ALL under threat.
In every corner of the world, men, women. It's a journalistic article so sad, a big title so weak.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other (and equally relevant) contexts: Women are the first care givers - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc, etc.
So much smarter comments could have been made on the ways, the reasons and the places where we can all contribute to a better understanding and interpretation of cultural and sociological approaches, and the gender differences that could help combat Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's get started, think about it and write it, don't just make noise.
There's a moment for everything.
If you are not able to offer a good analysis and intelligent opinion, maybe you should just think before writing?
Although I would put female genital mutilation on the same footing as beheading — a form of terrorism that is equally barbaric, its survival rate by making it a different form of torture — say that its temporary suspension is a “light of hope” beyond comprehension.
By the way - I see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of "validity" in his opinion, but in this case obviously it does not give a better perspective than that of an average activist on the street.
And I thought the Guardian was "maturating" as a global resource for journalism - advancing into the 21st century, abandoning its founding precepts.
Who, on the editorial team, makes that sound like it?
For an elected territorial or other money does not count.
I keep reading that the territorial civil service is increasing its workforce, and I have never seen an article giving them the floor or trying to explain why.
That would be legitimate, indeed.
There will probably be lies and truths, it is up to us to separate the good grain from the tares.
The court of accounts is expensive to tell so many economic lies.
It's true that they never had anything to handle the people on Cambon Street.
TBs are not in deficit they have financing needs that can only concern and only the investments they make.
By using too fuzzy concepts the press like the World plays the game of all obscurantisms.
Debt is beneficial because it finances investment, collective wealth
Unfortunately, the debt mainly finances operating costs...
And as the over-employment of public servants (to make nice roundabouts for example) leads to an increasing and incompressible load (compulsory load until their deaths, since work for life + retirement), these communities are cutting into investments.
It is therefore necessary to abolish the status of civil servant, before the number of staff is reduced.
And also empowering mayors financially.
It is fabulous, the intercommunals should have been accompanied by a decrease in communal numbers and it is the reverse that happens, proof that adding one step is not effective without the removal of others.
How do you want to properly manage large territories like peanuts at TGV and car times?
The time of the horse when these territories were created is over, it might be time to react.
No, they would rather remain imprisoned, worse stuck, in the administrative web, it would seem!
Let's even try garrotes, It's not too strong to explain the situation of blockage to which the state of the Vème led with its providential men.
It really started with Pétain.
Then went on to lead to the "blow-out" series coming loudly about.
Why aren't they going to live in a $250 million apartment in Monaco above a cinema to leave all this suffering behind?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the words "it's the fault of the whites."
"responses" not "replies"
I sincerely hope it's sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when we hurry to be the first.
Whether it's sarcasm or not, there's an argument to make.
We now agree that the modern Homo Sapiens evolved in North-East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and during a particularly humid period about 150 thousand years ago they managed to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least the last eight thousand years) is part of history.
The current Minister of Defence had stated a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So he lied.
It was probably the only one in the government that seemed to be on the road.
Now we know we can't trust him anymore.
Resignation!
in 2017: Transformation into a comfortable private mansion of golden closets for future retirees of the Republic?
Moving from the floor dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for the wealthy and their families, the "Grand V" care of a 3-speed medicine.
We're gonna save money and the military will go somewhere else to treat the last kid's flu...
Do you know that 70% of patients sound civilians, from all walks of life?
The London Wasps?
I feel sorry for their fans who are based in Wycombe/London.
Like the London Irish and the London Welsh?
They abandoned the "London" last season.
It's just the "Wasps" now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, huh?
It changes that a football team uses the field of a rugby club instead of the other way around.
In addition, outside travel for Tigers and Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
In Stockport County, we had the bad luck of being bought by the Sale Sharks, and we ended up renting our own stadium from them once we regained our independence.
I was going to say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training on the ground, although they had access to other premises, did us no favour.
I love to support Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There's always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has a lot of fans and that until recently was on top for over 30 years, to see its stadium taken over by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the recent problems with the CCFC, but this must be a good slap.
For my part, I'm not the rugby club, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who doesn't do it except a few Wasp fans at work.
They and a few thousand other people in the Southeast will probably follow them from a distance or will they now have to support another team?
Beautiful pro-domo article and good popularization.
But who cares?
But then why not ALL computer systems are based on these concepts ???
+because a huge mass of programs preexist (cobol, java), +because not all systems require them, +because there is no magic wand ++....
And because for most computer systems, bugs don't really matter, what counts is being the first in the segment.
The work of G.
Berry's talking about a niche need.
Mr. Gérard Berry.
One should constantly (the media) such characters, who work for the good of humanity.
For children.
I know some.
The Professor (retired) Mr Noêl Dejean de la Bâte.
The former Director of Law and Political Science in Rennes Mr François Chauvin.
Professor Hugues Chabriat and his entire team of researchers.
Mademoiselle Isabelle Le Ber Researcher and his entire team at L 'INSERM.
Mr Jacques Le BER , Brilliant Computer scientist.
Madame Maîti Girtanner Concertist ( Piano) Professor of Philosophy, Medal of Resistance, Great Cross of the Legion of Honour.
Mrs. Hermine Venot Focké.
But these don't sell.
Real-time computing has become a key sector in many fields, and few know the intimate details of these processes.
I haven't been to a Olive Garden for 15 years.
The value for money has fallen.
I'm sorry for those who are going to lose their jobs, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices whose popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There is already too much salt in our diets.
Don't ask Olive Garden not to put salt in the future.
It looks like they're thinking about making more profits, and not making healthier dishes at the best value for money.
They think we're pigeons.
Oh yes, be careful that people don't have too many assaults.
And then let someone else make our soup, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's plenty of salt in it, it replaces the real ingredients.
We should also add some sodium glutamate.
The amount of salt you need to add to the pasta water is negligible, but it greatly enhances the taste of the finished product.
It is not only the taste of salt, it also affects the way pasta cooks.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there is no food.
Everyone should try alternatives to business cooking.
Are there family restaurants and do they offer tasty dishes at reasonable prices?
What is happening in the United States is sad.
A common work-related accident that went wrong.
A promising young man, an apprentice thief, followed his father's career in prison for murder.
A man messed up everything and brutally interrupted this vocation birth.
That he was sentenced to 10 years in prison seems to be the minimum.
Where else are we going?
Totally agree!
What a humor!
The desire to undo it is obvious and difficult to excuse and blame at the same time...
Indeed, the desire to undo it is hardly excusable.
That's why I have some sympathy for a 15-year-old.
During the trial, the kid's father complained that he would never see his son again, but that he would never apologize to the family of the guy he himself killed.
Who's really a victim in this story?
What do you come to mix everything!!!?
The kid's father was convicted for what he did.
As for the stupidity of the lost bullets, the accused and guilty, knew precisely that the bullets are dangerous.
The kid didn't do anything to the defendant!
So let him pay for the crime for which he is responsible!
Ten years, it's kind of a lot in my opinion.
For having the intelligence to shoot at this young man to make noise?
Yes, it's sounded!
If the opportunity arises, go on holiday in the Mosul valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small wine growers.
I've been doing it twice, the wine, the landscape and the food are excellent.
Moreover, if you are there during one of the many wine festivals held in each municipality, it is even better.
I'm sorry, the Moselle Valley, I hit too fast.
It's good to see that German wine is recognized.
Most importantly, German winemakers traditionally use only one variety of grapes, which means that they really have to work hard to maintain a certain quality.
Of course, some younger generations experiment with different grapes, such as in France, Italy, etc.
It is not only the Moselle region that should be recommended - Franconia, the Palatinate Rhine (Pfalz), Baden deserve to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is like a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are of the German style (or maybe it is the opposite, in short).
Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink wine after a meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during the meal, they now offer a lot, and with a much higher alcohol content than their favorite 9 degrees.
But their traditional wines bottled at the property are so complex, the sweetness is superbly balanced.
Try Schloss Vollrad's spatlese with a thermidor lobster next time you go to the restaurant.
Search Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
Hugh Johnston's World Atlas of Wine is a good guide, beautifully illustrated.
I understand that there will be new readers of the Guardian who discover wine, but this is a recap of every newspaper article on German wine since the dawn of time.
From time to time, there is an article about German wines that are arriving, the new Baden dries that will now accompany the dishes, the red ones that are surprisingly vigorous, but above all, it is not these disgusting Liebfraumilch that people drank when they were young (heu, I really don't think it's always true or evocative, unless I address the over 40s - who, as I say, will have already seen all this).
Closing the Val de Grâce would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the deplorable state in which the Administration of France is.
A crime against Louis XIV and a thorn in the foot of my great-grandfather and my great-grand-uncle who studied there.
In democracy, public health management should be subject to the vote of the Chamber of Deputies: these ministerial bickerings held by the barbichette, and these decisions taken behind closed doors, have become unbearable.
Sorbogroin's right.
We should do as in Green Sun: euthanasia at the age of 70.
Moreover, we could sell the meat that will feed our poor working poor (sic) because they can no longer go to the market.
In fact, find jobs for our unemployed, real jobs, and you won't have any deficit problems!
For the elderly, it is time to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
The endangered assets will not be able to sustain this demographic transition alone...
So geriatrics, of course, but to think other than a hospitable model of the 30 glorious.
From now on, the maximum growth of 1.5% (which has already been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the whole model defined after war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in medical matters in France: a certain rigour and discipline that we know more about in public hospitals.
If this symbol falls we're really screwed.
We're screwed first because the rest of the hospitals aren't up to it.
The scandal is that presidents and other elites are being treated elsewhere than in the public hospital.
The solution is more to increase the supply of public service in other hospitals than to maintain a two-speed medicine.
The Val is a pole of French medical excellence, and of course a symbol.
Closing it would be a mistake, another sign of the march towards the mediocrity of France.
Not to mention the military status, which must be preserved absolutely.
"The price of hospital day", a hospital management unit, is decided by the ministry with local supervision of the Regional Hospitalization Agencies.
The abomination of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, obviously the baby is just one of those economic refugees, he came to Australia to have a better paid job than he had at home.
In almost every country in the world, a child born in that country to two non-citizen parents is almost always non-citizen.
Australia goes further than most countries by making children born to Australian residents citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticized because it does not meet some remarkably high standards, with obvious difficult consequences.
Why???
I think it's double standards.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to put an end to all the persecutions and mistreatment and war that drive people out of their country and force them to come for help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people to come by boat, then we have to solve the problem that generates this traffic.
I have nothing to complain about life in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, the war ended six years ago and the country is returning to normal.
It all makes sense now, nimrod...!
Strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron didn't believe this little trick when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron denounced the war crimes and mistreatment that were still taking place.
Several European countries have since put the deportations of Tamils linked to the LTTE in suspense, believing that they would run a risk of torture upon their return.
UNHCR revised its asylum assessment guidelines in December 2012 and recommended that persons with links to the LTTE be considered at risk upon their return.
The year [2013] saw an increase in attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
Elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
Too late, boys!
Señor Nowak, se le ha ido el coco con tanto periodico.
In fact, this guy could not get even a chance to make it.
He didn't have an health insurance in the States?
So he would't have been given given any treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expenses during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes later.
Especially in Texas
Ah ah ah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not long ago, we were told that Ebola kills so fast that a large-scale epidemic was impossible (there is a whole scientific literature on the subject, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of contagion of the returned persons was zero.
The more we're reassured, the more scared I am.
You have to read funny newspapers to believe that a risk can suck.
Weak or very weak but not lame.
Finally, it is a scientific reality, the faster a virus is fatal (in general) the less likely it is to spread because the death of the host signs its own death.
The combination of the two (high transmission and rapid death) sometimes happens ex the so-called Spanish flu.
After this is the general quarantine to save humanity. ..
There is not something obscene about making media presentations of Westerners who are certainly brave and virtuous, but to the detriment of the thousands of other African patients whose profession, bravery and virtues are unknown?
Of course this highlights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help, but the repetition of announcements is terrifyingly biased.
Freedom of expression, so much loved by conservatives.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers in arms attacking freedom of expression and the right to privacy of Australians.
I bet they never imagined that their conservative inclinations would rob them of their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's one that won't do it next time.
Yes, that's exactly what we need right now, fewer health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A heating tower for when the problem really becomes out of control.
There are already not enough doctors working in the regions around Australia like this.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy about medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new Futures Market Fund for Medical Research, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, would likely only be an emergency fund for the budget.
Using the pretext of noble medical research, he will raise $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope that the Australian voters manage to see this excellent trick for what it is.
Tony Abbott is a lot smarter than we want to believe.
He explains that the sale of Medibank Private is compensated by the Futures Fund for medical research.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly and a loss for low-income people.
It may be very smart, but it's not fair.
Finally, Telstra's "lying rodent" and its Futures Market Fund were excellent guardians.
If it's not fair, then let's show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell at the next election.
The most terrible for Nadine is still the "old personality", tasty....
I also noted it, quite corrosive as a remark.
If only it could dissuade her from maintaining a buzz on her constantly..
The worst fate for a politics at the end of a career: not to be recognized on the street.
Hello She was not recognized in her city of Toul as being enough to administer it.
Like what "provincial" common sense has good!
We live in an odious time, Mrs. Morano.
I am of course against wearing the burqa, but that is not the point.
What this anecdote tells us is pure sarkozism: tiny mediocre ministers, a confusion between the function of government and the function of execution (if he could Sarkozy would come with his tonfa on every access to the road to show that he is indeed the guardian of public order), the rudeness and the overcuidance carried to their maximum degree.
I propose that Morano, Sarkozy and all those "old personalities" who have become disenfranchised to wear a firearm and a badge should be granted the right to exercise their self-proclaimed role as vigilantes.
But who's Nadine Romano?
This is indeed the main lesson of the case: even the police have turned Sarkozy's page, perhaps they do not even regret it.
He really has to stop before it gets embarrassing for him.
I envy this agent who didn't know about Nadine Morano, if only I could do the same...
same as bob, for the blow
No agreement, thanks to her we laugh well ...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, we'd have to make her up!
It's easy, though, she looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde wig.
On this one, N.
Morano obviously made in contempt indeed, in contempt of the police officer she had in front of her, and who should have multiplied the curves and the "Yes Madam, of course Madam, immediately Madam, tell me in which direction I must run to seize myself without waiting from this veiled woman".
"In one case, the Australian Super Hornets abandoned an air attack on an Isis target when the risk of killing civilians became too great..."
The Americans are not bad at it, but I still think Isis is going to overtake them or have already done so, in Iraq at least someone counted the corpses now here nobody does.
With regard to civilian deaths on an industrial scale, nothing rivals the western war machine.
I do not agree that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (which includes non-Westerners) between the two wars in Iraq would have claimed the lives of millions of Iraqis, especially children, the elderly and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war protesters I knew preferred sanctions to the "war machine."
Were you also the kind of guy who preferred sanctions over the prescription and men on the ground?
Very good point — the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and unwise in recent years.
Sanctions are generally ineffective and fail to reach the elite - probably a reason why they have the occasional approval of the so-called Security Council.
You may remember that the insurgents did not waste time marking their main enemy when they saw it in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the headquarters of the United Nations Mission that they had erected just five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place forcefully and twice and I imagine with satisfaction and cold-bloodedness.
As brutal and harsh as this bombing may be, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a UN mission was targeted like that.
Good point, I actually forgot that.
So add half a million people to the total number of deaths of Western nations (at least with recent unrest in Ukraine economic activity was directed directly to the people they intended to hurt).
It doesn't help your argument to exaggerate notoriously unreliable statistics.
The only even vaguely reliable figures on sanctions-related deaths are those of children under the age of five and they are even very suspicious since Saddam Hussain refused to let objective inspectors see the facts.
It was obviously in his interest to exaggerate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable estimate is that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows that.
For additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are no better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanctioned deaths among under-fives was about 10 times worse than in the UK, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanctioned deaths is largely biased towards this age group.
Of course it must be feared, but also the gift of gametes in general.
We must stop pretending that people were pure spirits, that love was all the children needed, and that we could do it with strangers that neither the parent nor the child might ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipus, 60% of the French do genealogy.
It is an essential and despised thing to know its origins.
Instead of acting as if it were obvious and using fancy arguments, we should explain what serious problems can arise for an adopted or conceived child with gamete gift.
If you learned that the parents who raised you did not provide the gametes from which you came out, you could recover, in my opinion, because they would not have committed any crime.
The latest developments in the LDCs (e.g. uterus rootstock) are at least as questionable as a reasonably controlled GPA.
The real question seems to me to be: does the frustration of the desire for children justify these acrobatics and it has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Very just as a point.
It is obvious that we must fear the GPA, what is that stupid question?
Of course, it's sad that you can't have a child when you want one.
That's a problem I had with my wife.
But still, it is less serious than being very disabled or becoming disabled, contracting a serious illness, losing all his children in an accident etc.
Of all the worries of life this is not the most serious.
This is one of many frustrations.
This does not prevent us from living.
And we can always take care of other people's children!
In a society that no longer bears any form of frustration, where the child becomes well consumed, GPA is unacceptable to me.
The desire for a child is not a whim in which one could use the other according to one's will.
Infertility requires reflection and acceptance.
