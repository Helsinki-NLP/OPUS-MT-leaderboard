Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages, the pandemic of VOCID-19 is progressing rapidly in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services need to prepare for a peak of OVCID-19 patients requiring care, in particular intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with IDVOC-19 have a mild condition, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are cured.
In about 14% of cases, CIDVOC-19 leads to a more severe condition requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a serious form of the disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to CIDVOC-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we evaluate the evolution of the cumulative impact of VOCID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), and compare it with the evolution of Hubei Province in China.
We also compare the current number of cases of VOCID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of VOCID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom
After China, VOCID-19 has continued to spread, and the dynamics of the VOCID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that OVCID-19 was a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of VOCID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
By 15 March 2020, cases of VOCID-19 had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom (UK) with 39,768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths between 31 December 2019 and that date, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy only.
Obtaining the Cumulative Number and Cumulative Impact of VOCID-19 Cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of VOCID-19 in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as ministries of health, national and regional health authorities in the various countries and WHO, is updated daily at 8 a.m.
These data were used to assess the evolution of VOCID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom and to compare it with the experience of Italy.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of VOCID-19, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of cases of VOCID-19, taking into account the natural evolution of VOCID-19, within each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of reported cases in each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m. with Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Developments of VOCID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The cumulative 14-day incidence of VOCID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative impact of VOCID-19 began to increase around 21 February before experiencing a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of VOCID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of VOCID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom compared to Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of 8 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of VOCID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of IDVOC-19 suggests that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in the responses of national public health services, potential variations in case definitions and differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for confirmation of VOCID-19, including for catch-up testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10% of patients with IDVOC-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in those regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of VOCID-19 cases to hospitals and/or intensive care services are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not presented).
It is, however, necessary to conduct a systematic collection to complement current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study carried out in 2010–11 showed a significant difference in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people in 2010–11).
Modelling scenarios related to the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of hospitalized cases of COCID-19 associated with risk > 90% exceedance of intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment for COCID-19.
Since cases were previously grouped in some regions of the EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care services generally have a defined regional population, data on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be established at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the VOCID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly within the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 as well as for an increase in the number of patients with OVCID-19 requiring care, particularly intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the recent rapid risk assessment of the ECDC, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, moving from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not allow sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented upstream.
The rapid risk assessment also identifies public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window in which each country can strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health services.
Otherwise, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a peak of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 Coronavirus Disease Epidemic (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 people infected in China and around the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which resulted in thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, VOCID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissive, and affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this paper strives to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this growing research topic.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
While many questions are still awaiting answers, we hope that this review will contribute to a better understanding and eradication of this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, on 25 January 2020, has forever marked the Chinese, who have been forced to remain cloistered for the entire duration of the gold week as well as for long weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) which caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; that is why it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease called coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and quickly spread to all of China before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of IDVOC-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, VOCID-19 is "public enemy number 1", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 studies have been published on VOCID-19, including in the fields of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, showing the sequence of the virus, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this emerging topic.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare IDVOC-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that occurred in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of prevention and prognosis of the disease, and address some outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, causing mainly about 15% of common colds 4.
However, over the course of this century, we have experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current VOCID-19 is therefore the third outbreak of coronavirus in recent history.
As shown in Fig. Fig. 1,1, outbreaks of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported to Wuhan on December 31, 2019 at the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was revealed.
The first fatal case was reported to Wuhan on 15 January 2020.
Meanwhile, the epidemic had spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, Wuhan was placed in quarantine with the interruption of all public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered to be the starting point of infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO described the epidemic as a global health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had already spread to all of China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).
As the situation changes rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of VOCID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but most of them in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
VOCID-19 was developing in homes, mainly in Hubei province and on the periphery.
The mean duration between symptom onset and diagnosis of CIDVOC-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproductive rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, coinciding with the massive displacements that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for CIDVOC-19 were sex (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large virus enveloped with single-stranded RNA.
They can be classified into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, coronaviruses known to infect humans belonging to the genera alpha and beta.
The envelope's Spike glycoprotein (S) binds to the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cellular receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins forms virion-containing vesicles, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was presented on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity between 10 sequenced samples taken from the site of origin of the epidemic, the Huananan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than to MRS-CoV.
Using transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium in the respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 was identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a lower infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short orf3b-encoded protein as well as a secreted orf8-encoded protein.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domains or patterns.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the complete human cryo-ME structure of ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for screening drugs to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original host and intermediate host
SARS-CoV and MRS-CoV have been shown to originate from bats and have been transmitted to humans via civettes and camelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-like coronaviruses from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission is still to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., hypothesized that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which would imply homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study conducted by researchers in Guangzhou, China, pangolin - a mammal with a long snout feeding on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology between a coronavirus found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% gap between two genomes is a significant difference, and it is therefore appropriate to wait for conclusive results to establish concrete evidence (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may well have similar properties.
It appears that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MRS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the innate immune system of the host through molecular pattern recognition receptors (MRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll receptors (TLRs), NOD receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I receptors (RLRs).
In different ways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the SARS-CoV N protein can allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defence.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Help T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defense cells.
However, coronavirus may inhibit T cell functions by inducing apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with complements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion in the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case scenario, to multivisceral failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by outbreaks, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1-14 days, but more generally 3-7 days, based on a study of the first 425 reported cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed an average incubation period of 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded that there was an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a demography of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective duration of quarantine according to the most precise incubation period possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of CIDVOC-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnoea and/or hypoxaemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In serious cases, patients rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest X-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus in order to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients required ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of a family and an outbreak following transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, much more than patients with VOCID-19, which is consistent with a higher lethality of MERS compared to VOCID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
For SARS, the main symptoms were found to be fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25 %) and sore throat (13%-25 %), and ventilatory assistance was required for approximately 14 to 20% of patients.
As at 14 February, the mortality of VOCID-19 was 2%, for 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
In comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 reached 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality, and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MRS-CoV, and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
As a result, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than it was for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or in a rally or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often travelled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or have been in contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks of the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals may be carriers of the virus without having symptoms for more than two weeks and that re-established patients may be carriers of the virus, which highlights the need to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of 4 × 109/L and 1 × 109/L lymphocyte count, as well as high aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were identified in 1099 patients with VOCID-19.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had increased levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the level of D-dimer, a degradation product of fibrin present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes was gradually decreasing.
Chest X-ray abnormalities were observed in most patients with CIDVOC-19, characterized by uneven bilateral shadows or frosted glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARSD).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes leads to a decrease in surfactant levels and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to inflate and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most disturbing chest examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of VOCID-19 revealed pneumocyte desquamation, hyaline membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and the presence of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which coincided with viral infection and ARDS disease and was similar to that of SARS and MRS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the primary endpoint for the diagnosis of VOCID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation was observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technique based on CRISPR technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which allows the identification of synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre sample) using a reactive strip in less than an hour, without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality if its use on clinical specimens is conclusive.
Because of the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only provide supportive care to patients with VOCID-19, while trying out a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of restored patients, Chinese medicine as well as psychological support.
Even plasma from re-established patients has been proposed for treatment.
The pharmaceutical companies are all working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the main threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary derivation technique used to treat critical heart or respiratory deficiencies.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as protection of vital organ functions, are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been shown that an excessive response of the immune system leads to cytokine shock in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a range of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shocks, especially for serious cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, were used to treat cytokine shock.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine shock include modulation of immune response by T cells, blockage of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 reporting suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, the use of high-dose steroids did not have a beneficial effect on severe lung damage in SARS and VOCID-19 patients.
Instead, they would lead to serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, thus significantly affecting the prognosis.
Nevertheless, careful use of short cycles of low- to moderate-dose corticosteroids has been recommended for patients with severe forms of IDVOC-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, was effective in an American patient with VOCID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated potential inhibition of other single-strand RNA viruses, including MRS and SARS.
Based on these findings, Gilead transmitted the compound to China to allow a number of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully controlled.
Plasma of re-established patients and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have cured a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from the disease is an ancestral practice.
In fact, re-established patients often have a relatively high antibody level against the pathogen.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize molecules unique in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Plasma was thus extracted from the blood of a group of patients who cured VOCID-19 and injected into 10 seriously affected patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, in combination with reduced inflammation, reduced viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary in order to propose this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
Furthermore, given the therapeutic effects, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma need to be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat seriously ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and effective to isolate B-cells from restored patients and to identify the genetic codes encoding the relevant antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would allow rapid increase in antibody production.
TCM has been used for millennia in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components into a formula that varies according to diagnosis, based on TCM theories.
Most of the effective components remain little or no known to the extent that it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of a specific effective treatment for CIDVOC-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or remission of a severe form of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have proven effective in the treatment of VOCID-19.
The highest recovery rates for VOCID-19 were observed in provinces in China that used TCM for 87% of their patients, including Gansu province (63.7%), Ningxia region (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used only 30% of VOCID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a rather rough comparison since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, need to be taken into account in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study comparing treatment using western medicine (MO) only with a combination of MO and MTC.
It was found that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time to disappear symptoms, and the duration of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only.
More impressively, the rate of worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%); similarly, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of TCM still need to be clarified through larger-scale controlled trials and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of IDVOC-19 generally have a strong concern about this highly contagious and fatal disease, and those in quarantine also have a sense of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, multiple psychiatric morbiditys were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact research and quarantine, as part of public health services' response to the OVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to a degree of guilt about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigmatization of family and friends.
For example, mental health care must be provided to patients with IDVOC-19, individuals identified as probable cases, people in contact with these populations, and any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional applications and electronic equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of infected animal reservoirs and humans to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-based vaccines to produce long-term potent neutralizing antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines were evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in the elderly and in models subjected to lethal provocation and their protection against infection with a zoonotic virus remains to be determined, as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS died 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the significant delay (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations in coronaviruses.
To the extent that this is an emerging disease, VOCID-19 is just beginning its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MRS, VOCID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a prognosis model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies conducted to date, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with IDVOC-19 are as follows (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main factor in the SARS prognosis, and this also appears to be the case for CIDVOC-19.
IDVOC-19 primarily affects individuals aged 30 to 65 years, with 47.7% over 50 years of age, according to a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying co-morbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognosis factor for patients with CIDVOC-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and Complications: patients with CDVOC-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to also bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in patients with VOCID-19.
It should be noted that age and the presence of underlying health problems are highly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage; it has been advanced as a potential prognosis factor for disease, treatment response and healing.
The correlation between the CRP rate and severity and the prognosis of VOCID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, a high rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also contribute to the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released in the event of tissue damage.
They are therefore traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major Clinical Symptoms: thoracic X-ray results and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with other elements for the determination of prognosis and complications of CIDVOC-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as an adjunct treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since high dose corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS cases, many survivors experienced avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, administration of steroids to patients with CIDVOC-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the epidemic of VOCID-19 has resulted in a large number of cases of exceptional stress, with patients often experiencing long quarantine periods, extreme uncertainty, and death of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and return to normal life.
Demographic studies to date have shown that CIDVOC-19 has different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tracts, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tracts and does not or does not cause symptoms in the first phase of infection, such as the coronaviruses that cause common colds.
As a result, newly infected or incubated individuals can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly impedes the control of the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV was considered to be transmitted by seriously ill patients with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
As a result, the current epidemic of VOCID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than SARS.
Considerable efforts are currently being made in China, including the containment of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of almost the entire population to stop the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as on other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the decay phase will last 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believe that VOCID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not die out in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in mid-nasal and throat samples from recovered patients 2 weeks after they left hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode like influenza.
However, encouraging signs were observed in China with the gradual reduction of new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
Initial estimates indicate that the Ebola virus was expected to cause up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually placed under control.
It is possible, as with SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infectivity and eventually extinguishes itself or evolves into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the OPVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by coughing or sneezing, and possibly also by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in stools, thus revealing a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health care professionals.
Precautionary measures should therefore be taken to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of patients, and even any person likely to be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible line of defence to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and breathable masks N95 (1860) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition on surfaces, where they could be transmitted to others.
However, only the N95 (1860) masks provide protection against the inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions capable of fully penetrating; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the SARS-CoV in size, since both are about 85 nm.
Since the particles manage to pass through five surgical masks stacked on each other, it is imperative that health care professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 (1860s) masks and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care professionals must wear fitted insulation blouses to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by eye contact.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have penetrated his body by way of the eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, health care professionals should also wear transparent visors or eyeglasses in contact with patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to remain confined to the maximum and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
It is advisable to maintain a distance of one metre from the sick.
These measures are effective means of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China on high alert after the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the population that the new virus was not contagious, that it had limited interhuman transmissibility and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message has led to a noticeable relaxation, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan has been missed.
Chinese disease control agencies must learn from this and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, because each word counts and may affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or official bodies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages rather than trying to reassure the population; and (4) carry out more targeted and relevant exercises in order to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases, but also to regularly test and improve society's response system.
The epidemic of VOCID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing this report, it has spread to all of China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
To the extent that this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and that the symptoms of VOCID-19 are also close to those of SARS, the epidemic of VOCID-19 gives rise to an impression of already vu.
However, there are significant differences between CIDVOC-19 and SARS, which need to be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
VOCID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women; the severity and mortality rate are also higher among older people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than VOCID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Transmission of the VOCID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by seriously ill patients, making it much more difficult to contain the spread of VOCID-19.
This explains in part why the SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than the SARS-CoV.
Regular tests for SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be negative for some patients with IDVOC-19.
On the other hand, re-established patients may be positive for the virus again.
This significantly increases the risk of spread.
Despite rapid progress in research on IDVOC-19, a number of critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where does the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology was established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 originates from bats.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the virus to be transmitted from the initial host, e.g. bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-expressing cells of other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve during human-to-human transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or resurface regularly like influenza?
It is essential, although it may take time, to get answers to all these and many other questions.
However, no matter how much it costs, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as quickly as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by approximately 2 weeks of disease.
Only rare immunocompromised patients experienced severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The first case of SARS occurred in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
Not counting the supertransmitters, it was estimated that each case could produce approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, with peak viral load occurring on day 10 of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, distorted liver function tests, and high creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory analyses of SARS.
Distinctive alveolar lesions, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20 to 30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokine shock, which may be fatal especially in immunocompromised patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolite is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal collection of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is in fact present throughout the world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old male hospitalized due to pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present globally, causing moderate respiratory disease.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS resemble those of SARS and are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS compared to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses known in humans.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MRS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of VOCID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four community HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of VOCID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable diffusion after transmission to humans, will influence the ultimate fate of the current VOCID-19 epidemic.
The four community HCoVs causing moderate symptoms have adapted well to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restriction factors.
With this in mind, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the greater the number of people infected, the more likely the virus is to be fully adapted to humans.
If he adapts well, his transmission between men will be difficult to stop by a quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired coVs have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are highly pathogenic, have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community acquired HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and will circulate among them without host animal reservoir or intermediate.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of HCoV.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a HCoV if it houses a close ascendant sharing a high homology at the nucleotide sequence.
The original virus has often adapted well and is non-pathogenic to its host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts the HCoV on a continuous and long-term basis.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, since 80 % of the animals in the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals may also serve as intermediate host amplifiers cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive for the anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, WIV1 is generally not considered to be the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
This is why bats cannot be the intermediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive for specific antibodies neutralizing MERS-CoV, as are camels from the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only by the respiratory tract, but also by the faecal route, which is also the main route of excretion of bats.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even smaller than the distance between the beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin.
Recombination is a widespread factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be from bat CoV, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another bat coV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids were also suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV bats close to HCoV-229E have been found.
First, unlike alpacas, men may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV bats are numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alpaca alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility, while bat alpha-CoVs serve as a genetic reservoir of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the interspecies transmission of bats to dromedaries and dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV found in bats is known through its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedaries for decades.
It has adapted well in these camels that have passed from intermediate host to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Unlike camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-like virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats through cutting or coal mines.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate booster hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the removal and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as noted above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred within a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is under way.
Compared with other single-strand RNA viruses, estimated mutation rates of CoV could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per site per year, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to new hosts.
However, the mutation rates of coVs are approximately one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when coVs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high mutation rate, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutation is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of human adaptation.
It can be assumed that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to the SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Third, CoVs change patterns randomly and frequently when the RNA is replicated through a unique "copie-choose" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for coV observed in animals, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
Beyond the above three viral factors, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
Indeed, an electron cryomicroscopy study showed a 10- to 20-fold affinity of this binding compared to that observed between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and sialic acid 9-O-acetylate for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and natural host reservoirs of HCoV, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Emergence of new HCoV: back to square one
The diversity of bat coVs offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat coVs are genetic reserves of HCoV.
Of the SARS-CoV adjunct proteins, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but were coding divergent ORF8 proteins.
This suppression splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which have occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, resulting in a shift in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoV, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that bats had adapted well to CoV from anatomically and physiologically point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress the replication of CoV and affect the "rereading" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared over the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate securely without causing a strong host immune response.
It is here that lies the secrets of observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes cases of severe infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary lesions.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from the replication of CoV.
The same strategy of dissociation of the immune response could have beneficial effects in treatment for SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, administration of interferon type I at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammasoma is deficient in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasoma with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of VOCID-19.
While a beta-CoV of bats sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV was discovered, there is also a coV of bats sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Beta-CoV of pangolin remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 were found, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that beta-CoV of pangolin may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs returned to the ramp due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the locals.
They are very active in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as has been done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, together with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat coVs, with very high zoonotic potential.
The cultivation of wildlife consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary human-animal contact.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity for contagion arises.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of coVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses reservoirs.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or near-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
Respiratory diseases such as flu or cold can be contracted, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The primary medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that may be harmful or cause disease.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including the reduction of the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; the prevention of infectious causes of diarrhoea; the reduction of respiratory infections;
and the reduction of the infant mortality rate in home births.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands with soap.
Pneumonia, one of the major IRAs, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, with nearly 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin desiccation.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common among health care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
Deworming twice a year, combined with daily washing of the hands with soap and daily brushing of the teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are organic matter in the soil, are difficult to soluble in water.
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can be used to target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
Therefore, although antibiotic-resistant strains are not the product of antibacterial soaps, antibacterial soaps may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the skin's surfactant and protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent disease and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to remove natural oils carrying dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of lukewarm water does not help to reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a moistener such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively remove germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRA), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand disinfectant or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid removal of microorganisms; however, they must not replace adequate hand washing unless you have no soap and water at hand.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may cause skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate the organic matter present on the hands, but only disinfect it.
This is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand disinfectants is highly dependent on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have shown long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, the effectiveness of which is reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than curb it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wetting hands with warm or cold running water.
Fluid water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not appear to make a difference).
Foam a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the backs of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The rubbing action creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse abundantly with running water.
Rinse in a stagnant pool of water can lead to recontamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and damp hands are recontaminating more easily.The areas most often forgotten are the thumb, wrist, and spaces between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and chipped nail polish can house microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; dry skin promotes skin lesions that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many cost-effective alternatives to washing hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, pouring water from a suspended and drilled canister or gourd and/or using ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tippy-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a pitcher suspended with a rope, and a pedal allowing to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a loaf of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is a debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
After washing and drying hands in hot-air hand dryers, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the pulp of the fingers and 254% on the palms.
Drying with air-jet hand dryers resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during movement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed against each other by passing through the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
The objective of hand washing in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewellery must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
During rinsing, water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash hands or use antiseptics for hands before and after caring for a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20 per cent of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits in increasing the frequency of hand washing beyond 35 per cent.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
For example, in most of rural Africa, taps for hand washing are rarely found near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options for building hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to persistent habits, rather than to a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can switch from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of hand hygiene campaigns to reduce illness and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that aims to foster behaviour change.Following the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji that illustrates handwashing.
However, one review suggests that the promotion of soap-based hand washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetid odors called miasmes.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public washrooms and in the washrooms of office buildings and airports.
The term "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be an accomplice to something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other "purification" compensatory measures, such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.

'Cause it's the flu season.
It should also be stressed that artificial selection can contribute to unintentional changes in virus genomes, most likely as a result of selection pressures, particularly by the host immune system.
An example is the loss of the complete ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E due to a deletion of two nucleotides.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, resulting in a shift in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoV, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that bats had adapted well to CoV from anatomically and physiologically point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low rate of expression of molecules of the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress the replication of CoV and affect the "rereading" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared over the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate securely without causing a strong host immune response.
It is here that lies the secrets of observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes cases of severe infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary lesions.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from the replication of CoV.
The same strategy of dissociation of the immune response could have beneficial effects in treatment for SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, administration of interferon type I at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammasoma is deficient in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasoma with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of VOCID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general pattern by which the SARS-CoV and the MRS-CoV emerged.
While a beta-CoV of bats sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV was discovered, there is also a coV of bats sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While market civets and other animals were found to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 were identified.
Beta-CoV of pangolin remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 were found, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that beta-CoV of pangolin may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 was designed by man, either voluntarily or accidentally.
CoVs returned to the ramp due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoV in bats and other animals has greatly altered our perception of the role played by zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HCoV to humans.
Numerous evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Because SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and civets on the market, the closure of fresh product markets and the slaughter of civets on the market could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from fresh product markets to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of many pangolin beta-CoV lines closely linked to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, if so, how this transmission occurs will remain to be determined in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the locals.
They are very active in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as has been done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, together with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat coVs, with very high zoonotic potential.
There are plenty of opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombin themselves, leading to the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or deadly CoVs in humans in the future.
The cultivation of wildlife consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary human-animal contact.
In response to the ravages of SARS, MERS and VOCID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity for contagion arises.
Although bats have many characteristics favourable to virus spread, the likelihood that humans will be in contact with bats and other wildlife species may be minimized if people are sensitized to the need to stay away.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of coVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses reservoirs.
Not all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are yet known.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or near-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
Future research in this area will clarify the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of VOCID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" of VOCID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team released a Quick Recommendation Directive for the Diagnosis and Treatment of the New 2019 Coronavirus Infection (2019-nCoV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to fight this pandemic worldwide.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge progress gradually on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "suspect case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of VOCID-19 (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome to Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO called CIDVOC-19 a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
Please note, however, that VOCID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge progress slowly on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of VOCID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) have had a total of seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have been substantially modified.
Since our directive received a comment from Zhou et al., they presented a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We endorse their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of VOCID-19 (test 7) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspect case must combine one of the elements of epidemiological history characteristics with two elements of clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and neighbouring areas or in other communities where cases of VOCID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of VOCID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a cluster of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in a reduced area such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging with characteristics of a CIDVOC-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte counts from the onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case must be based on the suspect case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) real-time positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome with strong homogeneity with the new known coronaviruses; (3) positive serological test for the IgM and IgG antibodies of SARS-CoV-2; or modification of the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody from negative to positive or increase in titre ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or in blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic blood screening was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications build on the ongoing work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and contributed to the addition of the positive result of the specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that caution is being exercised with regard to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
As a result, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified those who did not exhibit clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The evaluation system must also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and ask readers to provide their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that they follow and follow the most recent guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in a timely manner to provide assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to VOCID-19, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to VOCID-19 in a single day.
As a result, the country has recorded a single day of virus-related mortality.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IBDR) reported that the number of infected persons registered included 114 active cases and 33 cured persons, who remained confined to their homes.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still permitted.
By 19 March, these three people had recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's confinement until 1 May.
The Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the state of national emergency by 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be.
Most HCoVs come from bats in which they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoV are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of coV-host interactions in animals could also lead to a better understanding of coV in humans.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV). The genus Beta-CoV contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human coVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and limiting factors of crossing the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir host(s), intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the prevention of future contagions.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in the respiratory tract from patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow in WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the classical cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough observed in 10 to 20% of cases.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are present around the world and appear to be transmitted mainly in winter in temperate countries.
Stores in Australia reduce limit quantities of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their bans on the purchase of toilet paper to two and one package per purchase in all stores nationally, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits have been posted in the form of messages to the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
Buyers apparently amassed reserves for fear of VOCID-19 and the need to confine themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted purchases of toilet paper for home deliveries to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of 8 March, stated that with the restriction of four packages in effect, "many stores are still out of stock within one hour of delivery," and described the request as "unprecedented," while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, described it as "unexpected."
Sales saw a "strong increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the quantity allowed to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made available earlier stocks for a promotion scheduled Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventories, but local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult.
It anticipates an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some stores are unable to honour Wednesday's promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr.Gary Mortimer, an expert in distribution at Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores stock every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a large item, resulting in a small quantity of stock that, once exhausted, leaves large spaces empty in spokes, reinforcing the impression of a shortage.
"Coles and Woolworths consider that if the shelves are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, this will likely reduce panic," said Russell Zimmerman to ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives has Crap said last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper who manufactures Sorbent paper, noted that they are working 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au's article.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were organized because buyers were on holiday during the long weekend of Labour Day.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert intended to be cut out and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report by ABC Australia in which they announced that they did not plan to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed Sunday night that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 reels.
The World Health Organization calls CIDVOC-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) described the current epidemic of VOCID-19 (the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the degree of spread of the disease, not to the danger of specific cases, WHO has indicated the need to push governments to action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
"We are deeply concerned not only at the alarming levels of spread and severity, but also at the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He stated in CNN's February remarks that "except for the flu, no other respiratory viruses have been observed from its onset to its continued worldwide spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, stating that "we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
He added: "and we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases of the United States, said of the epidemic: "To be brief, the situation will get worse."
On Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of VOCID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing coronavirus disease epidemic since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of IDVOC-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The death rate is estimated at 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can vary between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to cough, staying away from other people, as well as monitoring and containment people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by introducing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic disruptions, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages exacerbated by panic shopping.
Schools and universities have closed down nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
False information about the virus has been circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of East and South-East Asian origin and appearance, as well as others from regions with many cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and closures in heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is believed to be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and closely linked to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first known person with symptoms had become ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no clear link to the subsequent focus of the fresh product market.
Of the first outbreak cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were found to be market related.
On March 13, 2020, an unaudited report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could go back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old person in Hubei province. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases appeared to be decreasing in China but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a strong underestimation of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4 per cent of the world's cases. UK Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance estimated that 60 per cent of the UK population had to be infected before they could achieve effective collective immunity.
The cases refer to the number of people who have been tested at VOCID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, until January 23, it was estimated that 86% of undetected infections with VOCID-19 occurred, and that these unrecorded infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the base reproductive rate (R0) for VOCID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with VOCID-19 are cured.
For those who do not heal, the time between the onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to VOCID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths were among those over 60 years of age, and 75% were suffering from pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official counts of deaths related to the OPVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who died who were tested positive for OPVID according to official protocols.
The number of actual victims of IDVOC-19 may be much higher, as it may not include those who have not been tested - e.g. at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy show that the figures for over-mortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count of deaths from CIDVOC.
A spokesperson for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "We know that [the number of deaths announced] is understated," a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of the under-assessment in the United States. Such an under-estimation often occurs during pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first out-of-continental death occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first out-of-Asia death occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time since the outbreak began, and demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-death ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case-death ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the case-death ratio estimates decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms between January 1 and 10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other indicators are the rate of lethality (fatality rate), which represents the percentage of diagnosed people who succumb to a disease, and the rate of infection (infection rate), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who succumb to a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have attempted to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the overall rate of infection for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomised tests for VOCID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of the tests on lethality rate estimates.
WHO argues that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said: "Uncontrolled, usually infectious epidemics stabilize and then begin to regress when the disease comes to lack available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at the moment when this will happen."
Chinese government chief medical advisor Zhong Nanshan said that "this could be over by June" if all countries manage to mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that the SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two."
According to an Imperial College study conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus—as it is very easily transmitted—will disappear completely" and that it "could turn into a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year."
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
Symptoms of VOCID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO says that about one in six people is seriously ill and has breathing difficulties.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States (CDC) identify emergency symptoms such as respiratory difficulty, persistent pain or chest pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakenings, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. Subsequent development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, septicemia, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected individuals may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm the infection, so the researchers have issued recommendations that people who have had close contact with confirmed infected individuals should be closely monitored and examined to rule out the risk of infection.
Chinese assessments of the asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and onset of symptoms) fluctuates between one and 14 days; it is more often five days. A good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people carrying VOCID-19 who lost smell was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly during close contact and by fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking; this close contact corresponding to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by thin droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods, which could be projected by talking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected upon expiration, including by talking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
Postmen can land in the mouth or nose of other people next door or even be inhaled in the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and therefore cause aerial propagation.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
If there are concerns that it may be transmitted through stools, this risk is considered to be low.
The Government of China has ruled out the possibility of feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious for the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however the spread may be possible before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People have been tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
Only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission was detected by some countries during contact investigation.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if we do not yet know exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on surfaces.
Precisely, the virus could be detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Domestic animals and other animals have been tested positive for VOCID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however the UK authorities recommend washing their hands after touching animals, as after having been in contact with other surfaces that infected people may have affected.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to Wuhan's acute respiratory disease outbreak.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think he'd be zoonotic.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, to the subgenus Sarbecovirus (lignage B) associated with two strains from bats.
It is 96% identical to the whole genome of another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RATG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid of difference in some parts of the genome sequences between viruses from pangolins and viruses from humans.
Comparison of the whole genome has so far revealed a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however the final confirmation is done by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scanners.
A study comparing PCR and scanner to Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, because many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonia and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "the scanner should not be used for testing or as a first-line test to diagnose VOCID-19."
The WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on 17 January.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available in a few hours or days.
Usually this test is performed on a nasopharynx sample but one can also use a throat sample. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for general use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by laboratories certified only.
Characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and CT (scanner) of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral frosted glass opacities and a lack of pleural effusion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging is of limited accuracy in detecting VOCID-19.
A major study in China compared thoracic scanner results with PCR and showed that if imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating its inclusion as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutive neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect virus characteristics in both X-ray and scanner imaging.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include having overall good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.
It was recommended that those who were previously infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission, and many governments have banned or discouraged all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large areas of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. Health care professionals who care for someone who may be infected are advised to take the usual precautions as well as the precautions of contact, and to wear protective goggles. The search for contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments in this regard has raised confidentiality concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been launched or proposed on a voluntary basis, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's presence near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive for VOCID-19. False ideas are currently circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, flushing the nose and garging with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine against VOCID-19, but many organizations are currently working to develop one.
It is advisable to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after they have been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after they have touched, coughed, or sneezed.
This is because outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant containing a volume of at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be decontaminated in several ways (in one minute of exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% iodized povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of IDVOC is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or a crèche, all rooms such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and vending machines used by sick persons be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouths and noses with their folded elbows or handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing, and to throw away any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance travelled by the projected posts by talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions explaining where and when to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Wearing a mask can reduce people's propensity to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene."The use of masks has also been recommended to those who care for a person potentially affected by the disease.
WHO has recommended that healthy people wear masks only if they face a significant risk, for example if they care for a patient with VOCID-19, even though it recognizes that wearing the mask can help people not to touch their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage their populations to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical cloth masks. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially in cases of proximity (1 metre (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or crowded areas.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage people to make facial masks at home and clean them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public outings without masks or other means of covering his nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the wearing of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone could protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that anyone entering a supermarket wear a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks per day since mid-March, imposed the wearing of the mask on passengers on trains and intercity buses on 1 April.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of an artisanal mask to those who cannot buy one.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to slow the spread of the disease by reducing people-to-people contact.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
Social distancing methods can be applied by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowds, greeting oneself without contact and keeping a physical distance from others.
Many governments now order or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by U.S. government and health agencies was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of IDVOC-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious illness and complications, and were invited by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas affected by the epidemic. In late March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began to replace the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify the goal of reducing physical contact by preserving social ties, whether virtual or by keeping a distance.
The use of the term “social distancing” suggested that full social isolation should be used instead of encouraging people to keep in touch with others through other means. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation that you only have sex with someone you live with, who does not have the virus, or who does not have the symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for those diagnosed with IDVOC-19 and those who believe they are infected.
Health organizations have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation. Many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most stringent individual quarantine instructions were given to individuals in the most at-risk groups.
People who have been exposed to a patient with IDVOC-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where transmission is very important have been invited to quarantine for 14 days from the time they were last exposed.
Epidemic control strategies are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
The containment is implemented in the early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are turning to the mitigation phase: measures are being taken to slow down the spread of the disease and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Containment and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time.
Removal requires more extreme measures, in order to influence the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saves time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, masking and personal quarantine; public social distancing measures, such as the closure of schools and religious offices; a public effort to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental actions, such as surface cleaning. More drastic measures to curb the epidemic have been taken in China as the severity of the epidemic has become apparent, such as quarantine of entire cities and a strict ban on travel.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantine, and issued alerts on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore had provided financial support to those infected who had been quarantined, and had imposed heavy fines on those who had not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the grabbing of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but cannot avoid hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are overwhelmed.
Removal may be preferred, but should be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this happens first), because otherwise, transmission bounces back quickly when measurements are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to eradicate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for IDVOC-19, but development efforts are underway, including existing treatment tests.
Taking non-prescription cold or drink medications as well as rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently under study for the treatment of VOCID-19.
WHO stated that some "traditional and artisanal remedies" can soften the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of patients with IDVOC-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental response to the epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for redeployment of resources to different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to VOCID-19 testing, cancelling non-urgent interventions where possible, separating and insulating patients tested positive for VOCID-19, and strengthening intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are various theories about the origin of the very first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Within a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are usually linked to the wholesale seafood market of Huanan, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr Zhang Jixian at the hospital in Hubei province, which informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a "SARS-like coronavirus."
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumours, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission subsequently issued a public notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to the Wuhan health authorities to trigger an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by Chinese New Year migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub and a major railway interchange.
On 20 January, China reported almost 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted travel and introduced border controls.
National responses included containment measures such as quarantines (also known as orders to remain at home, shelter or containment) and curfews. As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are subjected to some form of containment in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world experienced some form of containment, a figure of 2.6 billion two days later — about a third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of VOCID-19 was dated December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the very first case would date back to November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause on 26 December, which she informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on 27 December.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
The doctors in Wuhan received a warning for "spreading rumors" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "obvious evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to stem the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in human history," a health cordon was announced on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting approximately 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles has been banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) have been cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was later built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as congress and stadium centres, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government introduced new measures to stem the epidemic of VOCID-19, including the issuance of health declarations for travellers and the extension of spring holiday holidays.
Universities and schools in the country have also been closed down.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Distance work measures have been introduced in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions have been introduced in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been changed and Chinese museums have been temporarily closed.
Control of population displacement has been applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (over half of the population) have experienced some form of displacement restriction. After the epidemic entered a global phase in March, Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a quarantine of 14 days for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted within the country within the previous five days, in this case via a traveller returning to Canton from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Prime Minister Li Keqiang declared that the spread of cases transmitted within the country has been largely blocked, and that the epidemic has been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, with the exception of Wuhan, two months after the start of the containment. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March, without specifying when this policy would end.
Persons wishing to enter China must apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March, and granted monetary stimulus plans to businesses. The State Council announced a day of mourning to begin with three minutes of silence on 4 April at 10 a.m., which coincides with Qingming Day, although the central government asked families to pay tribute online to respect physical distancing and avoid a renewal of the VOCID-19 epidemic.
It was confirmed that VOCID-19 spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
The nation's health agency reported a considerable increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a rally in Daegu of a new religious movement called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
The Shincheonji faithful who visited Daegu from Wuhan were suspected of having caused the epidemic.
On February 22, of the church's 9,336 faithful, 1,261 or about 13% reported symptoms. South Korea announced the highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, followed by 3,150 cases on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea were quarantined after three soldiers were tested positive for the virus.
The airline schedules have also been reached and thus changed. South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world to test the virus population, isolate all infected people and track and quarantine those who have been in contact with them.
Screening methods included mandatory individual reporting of symptoms by international newcomers via a mobile application, virus detection drives delivering the results the following day, and increased testing capacity to allow testing of nearly 20,000 people each day.
South Korea's programme is considered a success in controlling the epidemic, although it has not quarantined entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be indicted for mismanagement of the epidemic by the government or instead praising his reaction.
On 23 March, South Korea experienced the lowest number of daily cases in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was announced that from 1 April, all persons arriving from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.

Shia sanctuaries in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became a centre for the spread of the virus after China in February.
Against the background of allegations of possible concealment of the extent of the epidemic in Iran, more than 10 countries had located the origin of their cases in Iran on 28 February, suggesting that the epidemic might be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government on that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, while 23 of its 290 members reported having been tested positive for the virus on 3 March.

At least 12 former or current Iranian politicians and members of the government had died of the disease on 17 March.
On March 23, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.

It was confirmed that the epidemic had spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to increase rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the epidemic, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people in 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.

The suspension of professional activity and sporting events has already been ordered in these areas."On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities in the country, while Italy had 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including the Serie A football matches, were to be held in camera until April, but on March 9, the whole sport was totally suspended for a minimum of one month.

As of 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cures; the majority of these cases occurred in the Lombardy region.
A report by CNN indicated that the combination of the large elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all people with the virus to date may have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The UK response to the virus first appeared to be one of the most flexible among the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the UK government imposed no form of social distancing or mass quarantine on its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticized for its manifest lack of responsiveness and vivacity in response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement, advising against all non-essential social travel and contacts, suggesting that people work from home if possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and entertainment venues.
On March 20, the government announced that all leisure facilities such as pubs and gyms should close as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages, up to £2,500 per month, to avoid unemployment related to the crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced tougher social distancing measures, prohibiting gatherings of more than two people and limiting travel and outdoor activities to the strictly necessary.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were subject to police sanctions, including fines and dispersal of gatherings.
Most companies were ordered to close, with the exception of companies deemed "essential", such as supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, DIY stores, gas stations and garages.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control, the U.S. government's leading public health institute, announced that it had developed its own screening kit.
Despite this, it took time for the United States to start testing, which obscured the true extent of the epidemic at that time.
The tests were tainted by defective screening kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal approval for non-governmental screening kits (universities, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria to qualify for testing until the beginning of March (mandatory doctor's order thereafter).
On February 27, The Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been performed in the United States.
On 13 March, The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been performed.

Ma also donated medical equipment to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed concern about masks and screening kits manufactured in China.
For example, Spain removed 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus screening kits with an accuracy rate of only 30%, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese protective masks.
Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks; they were thought to have come from China, but they were actually coming from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in the Latin American and African regions. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004, where the Chinese authorities were accused of concealment that hindered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis in which the central government "provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the lunar New Year."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that although this was “not a recommendation of the WHO”, it was “a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated” and he spoke of a fact “unprecedented in the history of public health.” On 30 January, following confirmation of inter-human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO stated that the epidemic was an international public health emergency (USPPI), the sixth USPPI since the measure was invoked in the 2009 influenza A pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said the USPPI was due to "the risk of global spread, especially for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros stated: "there is no reason why measures unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel."
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries that “do not have the systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it is about to appear”.
Tedros then said that we were "as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more tomorrow." On February 11, WHO established in a press conference that the disease was named VOCID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate the "force of the entire United Nations system into the response".
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team has been activated to coordinate the entire United Nations response, which, according to WHO, will enable them to “focus on the health response while other agencies will be able to provide expertise to manage the broader social, economic and development implications of the epidemic”.
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team was activated in China to send international and WHO experts to China to support national management and assess “the severity and transmission of the disease” by organizing workshops and meetings with key national institutions and conducting field visits to assess “the impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including in urban and rural areas.” On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic”, indicating that although it is too early to talk about a pandemic, each country should nevertheless enter the “preparation phase”.
In response to the development of the epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a joint on-site mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO representatives stated that the global coronavirus threat assessment had gone from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Management Program, warned in a statement: "This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready," adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan then indicated that the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a declaration would mean that "we accept in absolute terms that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, WHO stated that the coronavirus epidemic could be described as a pandemic.
The Director General stated that WHO was "extremely concerned about both alarming levels of spread and severity and alarming levels of inaction." The WHO faced significant criticism of its management of the pandemic, which was considered inadequate, particularly because of the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition urging WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts focused on respect for the rights of each individual during the VOCID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone was entitled to relief assistance and that that responsibility lay with the Government.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for any discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that every individual has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, belonging to minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are responsible for the economic and social impacts of the VOCID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a platform that provides timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in different countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
Between policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy and responses to the effects of containment and travel restrictions, the digital platform includes a Country Policy Tracker tool to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a coordinated global response to the challenge posed by coronavirus.
The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, the British minister in the office of Michael Gove and the son of Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were relieved of their duties as a result of their management of the quarantine in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of politicians to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from popular anger over the coronavirus epidemic.
Some senior Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the initial idea that the coronavirus epidemic had started in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories that VOCID-19 had its origins in the United States or Italy.
Donald Trump's US administration called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", stating that in China "censorship has over-nourished a virus that has become a global pandemic," which was later taxed as racism by some opponents and intended to "disconnect attention from the inability of its administration to contain the disease."
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government outlining an apparently National Security Council communication scheme, the strategy cited as follows: "Everything comes from China.
We are being asked to try to communicate this message in all possible ways, including at press conferences and appearances on television."Press outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have said that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda push to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy leader Josep Borrell warned that there was "a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and "policy of generosity".
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively insisting that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called on the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while a priori sending aid to the latter two countries.
The 100,000 masks given by Jack Ma to Cuba were blocked by American sanctions on 3 April.
The US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own countries.
And other mask-related conflicts have also been reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy, which was affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian Ambassador to the EU, said that "only China had responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity".
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "highly placed political source" which indicated that 80 per cent of Russian aid was "not much or not useful for Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive of "political and diplomatic" charm.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane for medical assistance to the United States.
The spokesman for the Kremlin Dmitri Peskov said that "in offering his help to his American colleagues, [Poutine] assumes that once the American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment have gained speed, they will be able to return the same to them if necessary."
NATO's "Defender 2020" military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, NATO's largest manoeuvre since the end of the Cold War, will be reduced.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized Exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, it is endangering not only the lives of American troops and many participating European countries, but also the lives of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about 20 members of parliament infected, as well as 15 other former or current political figures.
Iran’s President Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, stating that his country was struggling to fight the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets due to the US sanctions on Iran. The epidemic sparked calls for the United States to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal childcare programme, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks on government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided about the response to President Moon Jae-in's crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be indicted for mismanagement of the epidemic by the government or instead praising its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this could enable Governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to govern by decree until further notice, to suspend parliament as well as elections and to punish anyone accused of spreading false information about the virus and managing the crisis by the government.
The coronavirus epidemic has been accused of several cases of supply disruptions resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases and a disruption of plant operations and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Agency has issued warnings about drug and medical equipment shortages due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Several communities have also faced panic purchases that have led to the disappearance of basic necessities such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, rays, resulting in shortages.
In particular, the technology sector has alerted to delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has been multiplied by 100.
This demand led to an increase in prices up to 20 times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world and WHO warns that this will put health professionals at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for gulls to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of VOCID-19 in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food products that followed, these two areas were spared by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal stockpiling and trade of essential products were a real success, thus avoiding the severe food shortages that had been foreseen in Europe and North America.
Due to its large agricultural output, Northern Italy has not seen a significant decline, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
The food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while members of the Chinese government released pig reserves to ensure sufficient subsistence for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy to ensure that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the global economy have been felt in China: according to a March 16 media report, the Chinese economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5 per cent.
As mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral epidemic has been identified as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain unstable until a clearer picture emerged on potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed that of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
The estimate of an expert from the University of Washington, St. Louis, reported an impact of over $300 billion on the global supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is said to have “broken” after a sharp decline in oil prices due to declining demand in China.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February following a significant increase in the number of cases of VOCID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concern about the coronavirus epidemic, several U.S. stock market indices, including NASDAQ-100, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, have posted their sharpest falls since 2008, with a Dow Jones dropping to 1,191 points, the largest drop in one day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week with a fall of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign debt rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Actions fell again due to concerns about coronavirus, with the largest decline occurring on March 16.
Many believe that an economic recession is likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures put in place by central banks and states.
Central banks react faster than they did in the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors because of travel bans, the closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations against travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe went bankrupt.
The impact on the cruise sector has reached a level never seen before.
Several ferry stations and ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the Chinese New Year.
A number of events involving large crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year's festivities, and private companies have also closed independently their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many lunar New Year events have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and the traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, the authorities extended the New Year's holidays until February 10, requiring most workplaces not to reopen until February 10.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has moved to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and has declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year festivities. The distribution sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in shop opening hours or temporary closures.
Visits to traders in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders saw a drop of 50 to 60 per cent.
This also led to a 33-43 per cent drop in pedestrian traffic in shopping malls in March compared to February.
Trade centre operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased cleaning frequencies, the installation of thermal scanners to control customer temperature and the cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million people living in extreme poverty in Latin America compared to a situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large proportion of the approximately 300 million rural migrant workers were stranded at home in interior provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied to the government for help.
The coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Containment in India left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily wage) unemployed. The Angus Reid Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian households had experienced some type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the containment imposed in mid-March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefit and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit.
The German part-time compensation scheme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, impacting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both wage earners and independents, at the global level.
Arts and culture organizations have attempted to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, to ensure the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists to the extent possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions around the world, to varying degrees, were closed until further notice and their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intense efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry was also interrupted. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of Holy Week in Rome, which took place on the last week of the period of Christian penance of Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday Masses; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online and live, or on television, while others offer to practice their worship in "drive-in".
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome, which closed its churches and chapels, and St Peter's Square, which has been emptied of all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies have also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants to the sacred sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the largest interruption of the world sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sporting events were either cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-20, the 2019-20 England Football Championship, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gaming establishments around the world closed and live poker tournaments were either postponed or cancelled.
This has pushed many players to register online, and many online gaming sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new listings. The world of entertainment has also been hit, with several music groups having suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as those on Broadway, have also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in place of traditional live performances, such as live and online concerts or online "festivals" created for artists to perform, broadcast and promote their works.
Online, many Internet memes on the theme of coronavirus have spread because many prefer humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of VOCID-19, there has been an upsurge in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that Chinese deserved the virus or received a justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been provided to Chinese people, both online and offline, and to people living in areas affected by the virus.
Following the spread of the epidemic to new, sensitive countries, Italians, who lived in the first European country to experience a serious epidemic of VOCID-19, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese from entering their country to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been a buzzer on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increased levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump faced criticism for calling the coronavirus "Chinese virus", a term that his critics consider racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, demonstrators attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and studying in large Indian cities are reported to have been harassed in connection with the coronavirus epidemic.
The President of the Western Bengal Unity of Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took his revenge on them."
The remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which describes them as "false." In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were stirred up by the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign waste" that should be "disposaled".
Many newspapers with paid access removed them for all or part of their coverage on coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made available their scientific articles related to the epidemic in open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory screening for the 2019 Coronavirus Respiratory Disease (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the virus and to detect antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both population diagnosis and surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have contracted the disease, including people whose symptoms were too mild to report or asymptomatic people.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among its population in March 2020.
By 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect reported lethality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerization reaction (RTR-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including the nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample.
The results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test from pharyngeal swabs is reliable only during the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected individuals tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken from the deep respiratory tract by aspiration catheter, or sputum (sputum) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 with a reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), and was the basis for 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK had also developed a test as of January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses, and the SARS-CoV-2-specific RdRp gene.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization from the Chinese National Administration of Medical Products for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their diagnostic device by RT-PCR in real time of the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Officer Resource.
Among the older versions of the test kits, one in three genetic tests obtained inconclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a bottleneck of tests at the Atlanta CDC. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Two-component tests were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only at that time that federal and local laboratories were authorized to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp has announced the availability of national testing for VOCID-19 based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed VOCID-19 tests nationally on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced. Sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the DCC.
In Russia, the VOCID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a test for VOCID-19 infection.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an FDA EUA for a test that took approximately 45 minutes.
FDA approved a test that uses nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently approximately 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to scale up manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, in the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, such as a rapid influenza test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "pulmonary x-rays have low diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of CT [tomography] may be conclusive even before symptoms develop."
Typical symptoms visible on TDM include multi-lobar bilateral frosted glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distribution.
A subplenal predominance, a "crazy paving" and consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR with TDM at Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less precise, with several of its imaging results coinciding with other pneumonia and disease.
In March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommended that "the CT should not be used for screening or as a front-line test to diagnose VOCID-19."In March 2020, the CDC recommended the PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and as part of population surveillance.Tests can be carried out in central laboratories (CLTs) or by the patient's bedside test (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
Automated high-speed systems in many clinical laboratories are capable of performing these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, only one peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples may be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the agency and which, therefore, can now distribute their antibody testing.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The detection capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours, which is much faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are generally detectable 14 days after the onset of infection.At the beginning of April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country were effective enough to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan under which suspicious cases can remain at home, "the emergency department will provide the patient with a sample tube", patients spit inside, return it and receive the test results later.The British NHS announced that it is conducting a pilot project to test suspicious cases at home, eliminating the risk that one patient will infect others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if used.As part of the VOCID-19 drive test for suspicious cases, a health care professional takes a sample with appropriate precautions.
The drive centres have enabled South Korea to carry out one of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Physicians of Compulsory Health Insurance declared on 2 March that it had the capacity to carry out some 12,000 tests per day in ambulatory settings, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are covered by the health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-tests were available in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that at the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to and including 12/2020 and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) obtained a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of samples of 64 patients at a time, grouping the samples and testing only if the combined sample proves positive.In Wuhan, an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2,000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese: "Oeil de feu" in French) was opened on February 5, 2020 by BGI, and can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
Thanks to its 5-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modeling revealed that cases in Hubei province would have been 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capability.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplexed free models developed by Origami Assays have been published to test up to 1,122 patient samples for VOCID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small labs without a liquid manipulator robot.
In March, shortages and insufficient quantities of reagents became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This situation prompted some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes to continue screening.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now the country testing most of its per capita population for Coronavirus, and was in the process of intensifying screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were obtained through a combination of the ability to conduct drive tests and the purchase of a population-wide high-speed laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula to manufacture kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on January 17, 2020. The protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was only published on January 28, delaying the availability of tests in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing by health professionals.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has contributed to reducing the spread of the new coronavirus.
Screening capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of screening programs as the best way to slow down the progress of the VOCID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has resulted in hundreds of thousands of tests being delayed in private laboratories in the United States, and supplies of swabs and chemical reagents have been depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "faults". The government then removed bureaucratic barriers that hindered private testing.Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were unreliable.
The company explained that the erroneous results could be related to the inability to collect samples or use kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry has stated that it will remove the wrong test kits and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80 % of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic have provided false results. Slovakia has purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that have proved to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey purchased from China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them." The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
Screening, followed by quarantine of those with positive results and tracing of individuals who had been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first death related to VOCID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests among the entire population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Almost half of those with positive results had no symptoms, and all cases were quarantined.
With the restriction of movement in the commune, this measure completely eliminated new infections.
Through aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, Singapore's 2020 coronavirus pandemic has progressed much slower than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools reopened at the end of the holidays on 23 March.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive containments, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that the countries that performed the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, had much lower lethality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect people with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no analytical capacity and with limited experience in national laboratories of VOCID-19 send their first five positive samples and ten negative samples of VOCID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive in % of tests" depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests only people admitted to hospital will have a positive value in % of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is used to clean your hands in order to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, e.g. diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted via the oro-fecal route.
Respiratory diseases such as flu or cold can be contracted, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you don't have water or soap on your hand, you can wash your hands with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after meal preparation;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
after changing the diapers of a baby or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after having mowed or coughed/sneezed;
after touching an animal, animal feed or waste of animal origin;
Hand hygiene in a medical setting refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medication or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that may be harmful or cause disease.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including the reduction of the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; the prevention of infectious causes of diarrhoea; the reduction of respiratory infections;
and the reduction of the infant mortality rate in home births.
According to a 2013 study, improving hand hygiene practices could result in a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
The introduction of measures to promote hand washing could reduce the incidence of diarrhoea by about one third, a figure comparable to that obtained by supplying drinking water to low-income areas.
Washing your hands with soap reduces diarrhea by 48% and is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs), an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major IRAs, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, with nearly 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths due to diarrhoea by almost half and deaths due to acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually associated with other sanitary measures in the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin desiccation.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common among health care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilet (micion, defecation), after cleaning a baby's buttocks (or changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Proper hand washing is also required to prevent the transmission of disease, including before and after treatment of a cut or injury, after sneezing, coughing or foaming, after touching animal waste or handling animals and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand soap cleaning is low.
According to a 2015 study of 54 countries on hand hygiene, 38.7 per cent of households were washing their hands with soap on average. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77 per cent) and China had the lowest rate (23 per cent). Today, there are several methods to change behaviour and democratize the use of soap for hand washing at key times of the day. Among other things, it is possible in developing countries to offer school children to wash their hands in groups at specific times of the day so that children can make this a habit.
For example, the Philipinne Ministry of Education has implemented a "Primary Health Care Program" to promote the health and education of children.
Deworming twice a year, combined with daily washing of the hands with soap and daily brushing of the teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate microorganisms on the skin, soaps or detergents should be added to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are organic matter in the soil, are difficult to soluble in water.
However, adequate water flow facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria were rinsed with foam.
However, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that "automatic liquid soap dispensers are preferable."
Antibacterial soaps have been highly recommended for people who care about their health.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can be used to target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, although antibiotic-resistant strains are not the product of antibacterial soaps, antibacterial soaps may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the skin's surfactant and protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent disease and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to remove natural oils carrying dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of lukewarm water does not help to reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based non-aqueous hand hygiene products (commonly referred to as hydroalcoholic solutions, hand antiseptic solutions or hand disinfectants) began to become popular.
Most are formulated with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a moistener such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively remove germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRA), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (3.5 reduction, log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of the bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.99% (4-5 log reduction) of the bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand disinfectant or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands and the interstices between the fingers and nails should be fronted for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dry.
It is also necessary to clean your fingertips by rubbing them, palm-to-palm.The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid removal of microorganisms; however, they must not replace adequate hand washing unless you have no soap and water at hand.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may cause skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than washing hands with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate the organic matter present on the hands, but only disinfect it.
This is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand disinfectants is highly dependent on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have shown long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, the effectiveness of which is reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Among low-income populations, many do not have the means to buy soap, but rather use ashes or soil.
Ash or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than curb it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends proper hand washing to prevent disease transmission, following the following steps:
Wetting hands with warm or cold running water.
Fluid water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not appear to make a difference).
Foam a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the backs of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The rubbing action creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse abundantly with running water.
Rinse in a stagnant pool of water can lead to recontamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and damp hands are recontaminating more easily.The areas most often forgotten are the thumb, wrist, and spaces between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and chipped nail polish can house microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; dry skin promotes skin lesions that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many cost-effective alternatives to washing hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, pouring water from a suspended and drilled canister or gourd and/or using ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tippy-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a pitcher suspended with a rope, and a pedal allowing to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a loaf of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is a debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper towel industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and more modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands in hot-air hand dryers, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the pulp of the fingers and 254% on the palms.
Drying with air-jet hand dryers resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the pulp of the fingers and up to 77% on the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the toilet environment based on each drying method.
The air-jet hand dryer, which blows air out of the appliance at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hands and the appliance and potentially contaminate other users of the toilets as well as the toilet environment in a perimeter of up to 2 meters.
Using a hot-air hand dryer allows microorganisms to be diffused at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during movement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing in a medical setting became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent diseases in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use led to a decrease in infection rates.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed against each other by passing through the fingers.
In case of residue under the nails, it is possible to use a hairbrush to remove it.
Since the germs in the water are likely to remain on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
This helps to avoid recontaminating your hands in contact with surfaces.
The objective of hand washing in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, with a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure for washing and rubbing hands in the health field.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene prepared by the Organization are also available on the website for feedback from Internet users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercially available devices can measure and certify hand hygiene, if compliance with the regulations is proven.
The World Health Organization defines “Five Indications” for Hand Hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
After contact with the patient. Adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap (soap "medicated" or "antimicrobial") gives the hand washing agent an action of destruction of the germs.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing a surgical operation or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. In order to "frozen" one's hands for surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, a washing product based on chlorhexidine or iodine, sterile towels to dry one's hands after washing them, a sterile brush to rub itself and another sterile instrument to clean under the nails.
All jewellery must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
During rinsing, water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
Once the hands are washed, dry hands with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical casaque.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash hands or use antiseptics for hands before and after caring for a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20 per cent of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits in increasing the frequency of hand washing beyond 35 per cent.
Comparing hand washing with an ordinary soap with an antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, comparing hand cleaning with an alcohol-based solution and hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds each, the former reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the latter.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products in reducing the influenza A (H1N1) virus and difficult Clostridium spores present on the hands. In order to improve the hygiene of the hands in health care facilities, it is possible to train staff in hand washing, to make more alcohol-based products available to them and to send them written and verbal reminders on this subject.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered to be an inexpensive and essential tool to maintain health and even to feed properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or hand-washing facilities at home, at school and in the workplace, it is difficult to achieve universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in most of rural Africa, taps for hand washing are rarely found near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options for building hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to persistent habits, rather than to a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and raising awareness of soap washing of hands can influence policy decisions, communicate the benefits of soap washing and lead to long-term behaviour change among the population.
Monitoring and evaluation activities are necessary for this process to be successful.
A systematic review of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of hand washing in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can switch from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of hand hygiene campaigns to reduce illness and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that aims to foster behaviour change.Following the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji that illustrates handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the number of healthy years of life gained (i.e. DALY avoided).
However, one review suggests that the promotion of soap-based hand washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, particularly for vulnerable people such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetid odors called miasmes.
In the 1980s, foodborne epidemics and nosocomial infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The appearance of swine influenza in 2009 and the pandemic of VOCID-19 in 2020 have led to a greater awareness in many countries of the need to wash hands with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public washrooms and in the washrooms of office buildings and airports.
The term "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be an accomplice to something.
It came from a biblical verse in Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands in a compulsive manner to try to clean up an imaginary spot, symbol of her bad conscience in view of the crimes she committed and incited her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some people, after remembering or considering committing unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and to give more value to hand washing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other "purification" compensatory measures, such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienical and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, which consists of using water and not soap to wash hands, is part of hand washing rituals promoted in many religions, including Baha'ism and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual ablution of hands (Netilat Yadayim) in Judaism, sink in Christianity and wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hand washing for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.
Workplace Risk Controls for VOCID-19
Risk controls for VOCID-19 in the workplace refer to the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls vary by workplace and task, based on an assessment of the risk of exposure sources, the severity of disease in the community, and individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to CIDVOC-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other collaborators, in which case only basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory labeling, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Jobs at medium risk of exposure include those requiring frequent or close contact with persons without suspected or known VOCID-19 but who may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, especially in schools, high-density working environments and some high-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly efficient air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of personal protective equipment in the event of a meeting with a person with VOCID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with a suspected or known high risk of exposure with a VOCID-19, moving to a very high risk if they carry out procedures producing aerosols or taking or handling samples of persons with a suspected or known VOCID-19.
The appropriate risk checks for these workers include technical checks such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and task-specific personal protective equipment.
Epidemics of VOCID-19 can have several effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have become ill, have to take care of others or fear possible exposure.
Business models can change, both with respect to the goods requested and the means of acquiring them (including shopping outside peak hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of items from geographic areas severely affected by IDVOC-19 may be interrupted. A plan for the preparation and response to infectious diseases may be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors related to the family and community context, and individual risk factors for workers such as advanced age or chronic conditions.
They also outline the controls needed to deal with these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
Targets for responding to an epidemic include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining commercial operations, and reducing adverse effects on other parts of their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The hierarchy of risk controls forms an overall framework used in occupational health and safety to group risk controls together by effectiveness.
Where the risks of VOCID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on workers' behaviour and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls refer to changes in policies or procedures at work that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the worker's risk, properly adapted to the needs (e.g., respiratory masks), worn properly and systematically, inspected regularly, maintained and replaced as required, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, the respiratory label, including covering their mouth and nose for coughing and sneezing, providing handkerchiefs and garbage bins, preparing for telework or scheduled hours of work as needed, deterring workers from using the tools and equipment of others, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a crucial step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they no longer have fever, signs of fever, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of febrifus or other medications acting on symptoms, and that they apply flexible sick leave policies, allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and inform employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at medium risk of exposure include those that require frequent or close contact, less than six feet (1.8 m), of people without suspected or known VOCID-19 but who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip to an area with widespread transmission of VOCID-19.
This includes workers in contact with the general public in particular in schools, high density working environments and certain high volume retail environments.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aeroplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include: separating the patient from the other person by a distance of 6 feet, designating a crew member to take care of the patient and offering a protective mask to the patient or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, where possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or breathing difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items must be disposed of in a bag intended for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls include postponing travel in the event of illness and self-isolation and immediate information from the on-board medical centre if fever or other symptoms develop once on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the isolated person's cabin. For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection purposes if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of community spread.
In the case of minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as cancelling educational outings, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals in the canteen, increasing space between offices, staggering arrival and exit times, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate infirmary for children with influenza symptoms.
In the event of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays may be envisaged. For law enforcement officers who perform routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact suspected or confirmed persons with VOCID-19 must follow the same guidelines as paramedics, including the wearing of adequate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during arrest, workers shall clean and disinfect their equipment and service belts prior to re-use with a household detergent wipe or spray and follow standard procedures for containment and disposal of used PPE and for containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers some health and funeral workers to belong to high or very high risk categories of exposure.
High-risk jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known VOCID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they carry out procedures producing aerosols or taking or handling patient samples with suspected or known VOCID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling.
High-risk funeral jobs include workers involved in preparing bodies with suspected or known VOCID-19 at the time of death; they move to a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical checks of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known VOCID-19, including when carrying out aerosol production procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health and funeral environments.
Samples should be handled using level 3 biosafety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms based on the suspicion of VOCID-19. In addition to other PPEs, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for people working within 6 feet of patients with an infection suspected or known by SARS-CoV-2 and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95-approved or superior NIOSH-approved breathing masks must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide better protection and comfort for the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, as VOCID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by body fluids.
WHO recommends the use of a surgical mask only by screening staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples, take care of or transport VOCID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol production procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, eyeglasses or facial screens, blouses and gloves.
In the case of aerosol production procedures, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a PVCID-19 patient-occupied room to those directly involved in its care, using PPE for the specific task only, continuing use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the management of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the PPE supply chain and deterrence of the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Lightening the load and preparing for the future
DATE/ TIME OF TRANSMITTION: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
This month we are in an exceptional situation.
The epidemic of VOCID-19 is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the kind of global empathy, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and benevolence that we have seen among all our colleagues in emails, calls and instant conversations is a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we are fortunate to work.
I cannot be more grateful and proud of all of you among my colleagues.
Last week, someone expressed his gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia today, and the strong symbol of the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain the operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the security of our communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but also how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make significant adjustments to the way we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team-c met last night to discuss our approach and schedule in the days and months to come.
During this conversation, we considered what we believe would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
Above all, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to step back, don't worry.
To all staff, contractors and contractors:
our daily working time target will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you may be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, shopping or consulting a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't watch your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should go without saying, but we say so.
No sick leave or paid leave required: simply notify your supervisor and help your team review schedules and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive for VOCID-19, please notify Bryan of T&amp;C Ops for T&amp;C to help you and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention from management).
The hourly staff will be fully remunerated.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our hourly subcontractors and colleagues.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of normal working hours under normal conditions.
This applies if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means to relieve their stress from the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We are simply asking you to contact your superior, so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we need to continue to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Security and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing essential work that may require reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess current objectives and focus on supporting the core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to "work twice as hard to make up for lost time" when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to work overtime to meet now unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will strive to establish new goals and timelines where appropriate.
What about the APA (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and daily working time targets, we plan to adjust the time frame for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to set a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, take care of them and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their work schedule reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps upon confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco-based colleagues may have been exposed to VOCID-19.
However, as a matter of caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own duty of care protocol that uses products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return to it.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork office, which shared its VOCID-19 protocol with us and all Washington DC-based staff.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a fully remote configuration according to San Francisco advice.
As some of our New York-based colleagues know, we also discussed the idea of renting a room in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but could be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues familiar with remote work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and would like to offer you some advice:
Reduce the length of meetings to sessions by up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider allocating them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send documentation in advance.
Make videos the norm, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and online exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or make a collective note).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your wellness refund for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk with your colleagues about job distribution
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomie guidelines based on webinars to support the increase in the distribution of work within the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the EU grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edit-a-thons, until the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed-upon grant activities and that no one would be penalized for delays or changes in these objectives.
Next week, we will issue additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sadness at the upheaval and relief at the clarity and opportunity to focus on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for the rest, the TRC is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Staying in touch despite issues related to VOCID-19
We will send an invitation on your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this moment to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
Until then, you can always find the information contained in this e-mail, as well as all other essential information related to VOCID-19, on Office Wiki.
The TRC will update these pages and collect all information in the same location.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a large workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help with anything else, don't hesitate to prevent and work with the TRC.
We are here to support you and act as liaison if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive questions, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judan, Director of Global Operations International HR.
None of these changes should be seen as an abandonment of our work and obligations.
On the contrary, it is a question of recognizing that at present our work and obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps we consider necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help it needs, and to offer the world the service on which everyone can rely.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us in due course.
For now, it is time to help each other and prepare for the important work that will come in the weeks and perhaps months to come.
We need each of you to do this, which is why you need to protect yourself and take care of your families so that you can give the best of yourself when the time comes.
Finally, please: wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, the TRC (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b'The angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme bound to the outer face (cell membranes) of cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 against the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7) making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 is also the entry point into cells of certain coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminate peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminate renal amino acid transporter collector domain.
ACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, the enzyme-active domain of which is exposed on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme calledsheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and then excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is linked to the cell membrane primarily cells of type II pulmonary alveoli, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
The expression of ACE2 mRNA is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to compensate for the ACE.
ACE clives angiotensin I hormone to angiotensin II vasoconstrictor.
ACE2 clives phenylamine amino acid with carboxylic termination of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis to vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also deliver several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the primary entry point into cells of certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing VOCID-19).
Specifically, binding of the SARS-CoV spicle S1 protein and SARS-CoV2 to the ACE2 enzyme domain at the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme in the endosomes within the cells.
This entry process also requires the initiation of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, inhibition of the latter is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that the reduction of ACE2 levels in cells can contribute to the control of infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who have a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly stroke and heart failure patients.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less convincing than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The recombinant human angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (rhACE2) is anticipated as an innovative treatment for severe lung damage and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the time to action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour duration of effect.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people who are intolerant to conventional renin-angiotensin (RSA) inhibitors or for diseases with high circulation of angiotensin II. RhACE2 under infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
VOCID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracing of contacts in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, that is, the identification of individuals ("contacts") who may have come into contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the Government in certain jurisdictions and territories.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracing applications.
These systems, particularly those based on tracking the geographic location of application users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, such as using Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a feature to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people carrying VOCID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has opted for an application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local IT community, it has been provided as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth application that tracks exposure to potentially infected people and communicates quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technologies and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government declared that the contact tracing application was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering implementing applications based on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geo-referencing application for patients diagnosed with VOCID-19 and residing in Moscow, to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Safety Engineering at Cambridge University, spoke about a number of possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiencies if only a small portion of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple allows only "official" or generally trusted organizations to add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists expressed concern about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat has been removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such surveillance.
These organizations have stipulated eight conditions to be met in government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Extensions of control and surveillance should include sunset clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the control objectives of VOCID-19;
data security and anonymity should be protected in a demonstrable manner;
digital surveillance should ensure that there is no exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in law;
protections against abuse and remedies for citizens should be provided in the event of abuse;
"significant participation" of all "relevant stakeholders" would be mandatory, including public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of the persistence of surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracing.
In Israel, network tracing has been approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems based on central servers need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, thus respecting privacy (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used for tracing contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including tracking data from mobile devices and card transactions, which they then associated to send SMS warnings to potentially infected people.
In addition to the use of this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made location information publicly available, which was authorized following extensive changes to the privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized privacy systems.
Details had not yet been communicated on 6 April 2020.
The tracking of privacy contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data as of 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly known as Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocol and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leaves the device and that all matching is done on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy techniques when collecting and using location or contact data to monitor the spread of VOCID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Enigma MPC's SafeTrace platform, a company developing privacy protection technologies originally founded at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising their confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracing and alerting applications, a key factor in their adoption by a broad audience.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative, stating that it would preserve privacy and combine Bluetooth Low Energy technology with privacy cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable governments to create formal privacy-sensitive coronavirus tracing applications
Direct integration of this feature into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to resolve the problems of adopting the solution and persisting surveillance by initially distributing the system through operating system updates and later removing it in the same way once the threat is removed.
Repositioning a drug (also known as reorientation, reprofile, reassignment or change of therapeutic indication of a drug) refers to the conversion of a drug approved for a disease or medical condition different from that for which it was originally developed.
This is a scientific research focus currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments for VOCID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a vaccine against VOCID-19 and the transfusion of plasma from convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites offers a realistic project to develop an effective antiviral drug against VOCID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-type protease, dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial medicine also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that New York State trials for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but not eligible for treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors have indicated that they use this medication "when there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Larger studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has reminded the public that the evidence in favour of the medicine is thin and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the medicine from Japan for its reserves and that it would use the army to deliver the medicine to university hospitals where the medicine would be used to treat patients with VOCID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up possibilities for Trump administration to acquire the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in serious cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to procreate.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
These drugs have been designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would link with the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for repositioning drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences then discovered that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against several filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies prior to the trial suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by university hospitals in Cleveland; one involving people with moderate pathology and the other involving those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with VOCID-19; two controlled against placebo (China and Canada) and one without control (Italy).
New York State began testing for the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial of Teijin's alvesco (ciclesonide), an inhalation corticosteroid used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme, a Phase II trial is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine treatment effectiveness.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with moderate symptoms of CIDVO-19.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who have been diagnosed positive for CIDVOC-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian drug agency to issue guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study involving 300 patients and studying the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic dosages was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for earlier outbreaks such as MRSA, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for treatment of VOCID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir has been recommended for treatment of VOCID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as treatments for VOCID-19:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Trials are also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A VOCID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical tests, many developmental attempts are underway.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected for SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the disease, for at least 18 months.
As of April, five vaccine candidates were in the phase I safety study.
VOCID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic spread around the world in 2020, generating significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
Defined in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against VOCID-19.
The main platform targets for Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, type 5 adenoviral vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) are confirmed as active and 37 others are announced, but with little public information available (summary under planning or design).
A Phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomised, controlled against placebo and performed in several centres, while determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the efficacy of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring adverse reactions at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active-development vaccine candidates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human assessment phase (always in "preclinical" research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular pinch vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
On or about January 24, 2020 in Canada, the University of Saskatchewan's International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) announced that it had started working on a vaccine, which is expected to begin testing on humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had started working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen develops an oral vaccine in collaboration with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that of neo-antigen vaccination used for cancer treatment.
On March 25, the director of the research institute announced that they had finalized the vaccine synthesis and that they were beginning the tests.
On February 27, 2020, a Generex subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it had started a vaccine project to create an Ii-Key peptide vaccine against VOCID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St Louis announced its vaccine development project.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both west of Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced its partnership with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced preclinical testing projects and a Phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even under accelerated procedures, it would take approximately one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported developing a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is currently being researched in the laboratory, with human tests scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian announced that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "high sums of money to benefit from exclusive access to the VOCID-19 vaccine", which sparked the German government's protest.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of a mRNA-based vaccine.
The BNT162 mRNA vaccine candidate is currently in the preclinical test phase with the start of clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the human test of its final vaccine candidate could begin in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a consortium for the research of a vaccine against VOCID-19 including the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI in the development of a vaccine against VOCID-19 to US$29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of a vaccine against VOCID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started testing the animals of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifier RNA vaccine against VOCID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days after the sequence was sent by China.
In late March, the Government of Canada announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against VOCID-19, including several vaccine applicants at Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of C$192 million for the development of a vaccine against VOCID-19 with plans to create a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that could be used if other coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against VOCID-19 in mice, stating that "the subunits of SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines administered by micro-needles triggered an important response from [in mice] antigen-specific antibodies observed 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo pharmacy school announced the design of a candidate for a DNA-based vaccine in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, combined with cloud-hosted IT resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia is planned to include 4,170 health professionals.
Vaccines under development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using animal models specific to VOCID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures for handling live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines were tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine against SARS that has demonstrated both its safety and efficacy in humans.
Research papers published in 2005 and 2006 indicated that the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.There are no proven vaccines against MRSA.
When MERS spread, it was thought that existing SARS research could serve as a model for developing vaccines and drugs for MERS-CoV infection.
By March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) had completed phase I clinical trials in humans and three more were in progress; all vaccines were viral vector, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications released a conspiracy theory that the virus that caused OVCID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited in various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can vary between two and fourteen days.
While the majority of cases cause moderate symptoms, some progress towards viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have cured. The virus spreads mainly during close contact, often by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
As these droplets are produced at expiry, they usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than represent an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also get infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and during subsequent phases of the disease. The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for wearing masks by the general public vary, with some authorities not recommending their use, others recommending their use, and others imposing their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for CIDVOC-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and a blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, higher respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nasal discharge or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying proportions.
Some cases in China initially showed only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can cause pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The incubation period for VOCID-19 is usually five to six days, but can last up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. Korea's disease prevention and control centres (KCDCs) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic during their hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of 166 infections found today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Sputum and saliva can both carry large viral loads.
Speaking loud releases more droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not transported by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside of the patient's chambers produced positive viral RNA samples.
Some medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (CPR) can disperse respiratory secretions and thus cause aerial propagation.
Although there are concerns about the spread of stools, this risk is perceived to be low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if we do not yet know exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on surfaces.
Precisely, the virus could be detected after one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and after four hours on 99% copper.
This varies, however, depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, which deactivates and eliminates it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three individuals with pneumonia related to Wuhan's acute respiratory disease outbreak.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. The SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
Lungs are the organs most affected by VOCID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2), which is most abundant in the type II cell cell of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spicle" (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage has been reported in 12% of people admitted to Wuhan hospital in China, and is more common when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be related to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and cardiac functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) has been observed in patients in intensive care units with VOCID-19 infections and may be associated with an unfavourable prognosis. Autopsies of deceased VOCID-19 individuals have shown diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 presents a tropism for respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE-2, patients with severe CIDVOC-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, the secretory T cells of GM-CSF have been associated with recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe lung disease in patients with VOCID-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported at the autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by nasopharyngeal sampling; however, nasal or sputum sampling may also be used.
Generally, results are available in a few hours, or up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, however they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to develop independent chain polymerization reaction (PCR) tests to detect virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (likely to detect active infections and an individual's previous infection) were being developed, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese test experience revealed an accuracy of only 60-70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test closest to the patient on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the University of Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods of infection detection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobar bilateral frosted glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the onset of infection.
Dominance under pleural, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may occur with disease progression.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and on the pathophysiology of VOCID-19.
The main pathological findings at the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocytic hyperplasia, extended atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARSD) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in recovery: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (IVC); leuco-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequently washing hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended that the face be covered with tissue in public places to limit transmission in the case of asymptomatic individuals Social distancing strategies are designed to reduce the contact of infected persons with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing displacement and cancelling large groups of people.
Distancing directives also include compliance with a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There are no drugs known to be effective in preventing CIDVOC-19. Since a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, a key element in the management of CIDVOC-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "flatten the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after they have been in the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after they have touched, coughed, or sneezed.
It also recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant solution containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where commercially available hand disinfectants are not available, WHO proposes two formulas for local production.
In these formulae, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores from alcohol, which is "not an antiseptic active substance for hands."
Glycerol is added as humectant.
People are treated with supportive care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analyzed.
Personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Supportive treatments can be useful for those with moderate symptoms at an early stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of inpatients for CIDVO-19.
Reanimators and pneumologists in the United States have collected therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment for VOCID-19.
For symptoms, some health care professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than frontline ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially under care conditions when carrying out procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health care professionals who care for people with IDVOC-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an isolation room suitable for air infection (AIRI) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and air transmission precautions. The CDC outlines the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respiratory masks (facial masks) are preferred.
N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an Emergency Use Authorization (ERA).
They are designed to protect airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face protection screens, or as a last resort, hand-made masks.
The majority of cases of VOCID-19 are not sufficiently severe to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory assistance for persons suffering from respiratory failure related to VOCID-19 is actively studied for inpatients. There is evidence that intubation can be avoided by using a high-throughput nasal cannula or positive airway pressure at a double level.
It is not known whether either or both generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some physicians prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles relative to a high-throughput nasal cannula. Serious cases are more common in older adults (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the health care system to treat a sudden peak in the number of VOCID-19 cases that are serious enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with VOCID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during VOCID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices with high pressure control modes and PEEP are needed to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of lung injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are being tested.
Remdesivir appears to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed before 2021, several drugs under test are already approved in other indications and the tests are already advanced.
An antiviral medicine can be tried in people with severe illness.
WHO has recommended that volunteers participate in efficacy and safety trials of potential treatments. FDA has granted temporary authorization to plasma of convalescent individuals as an experimental treatment in cases where the life of the individual is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and identifier.
The application is able to detect "close contacts" using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend auto-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. Massive data analytics of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and the people they have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data from people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was aimed at enforcing quarantine and protecting persons who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated telephone location data with the agency of the German federal government, the Robert Koch Institute, to analyse and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect quarantine.
In Italy, regional health minister Giulio Gallera stated that he was informed by mobile telephone operators that "40% of people continue to move".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global call for creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "enhanced social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have a moderate progression with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as cold.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe infection with VOCID-19 based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MRS, but there is a lack of data for VOCID-19. In some cases, VOCID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, VOCID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with VOCID-19 include septicaemia, coagulation disorders, and cardiac, renal and hepatic damage.
Coagulation disorders, particularly an increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of cases hospitalized with VOCID-19, with renal impairment observed in 4% of patients in this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with VOCID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lung resembles acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARSD).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest was observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had pre-existing pathologies. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region can also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Undercoverage of moderate cases may lead to overestimation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of CIDVOC-19 and were 2.4 times more likely to go to intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. Concerns also arose about the long-term sequelae of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority observed a 20-30% drop in respiratory capacity in some people cured of the disease, and lung scanners suggest organic damage.
This can also lead to post-healing intensive care syndrome.
In March 2020, it was not known whether a previous infection had effective long-term immunity in people cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered probable based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of persons cured of VOCID-19 followed by coronavirus positive tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be a worsening of a latent infection rather than a re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by spreading the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but as of December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost solely led by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of VOCID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time since the outbreak began, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, gender and health status.
At the end of 2019, the WHO affected emergency pathological codes CIM-10 U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths of clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed VOCID-19 cases without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death/case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the world death/case ratio is 6.9% (153,822/240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
This number varies by region. Other measures include the rate of lethality (CFR) that reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die of the disease and the rate of infectious lethality (IRF) that reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed or not) who die of a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected individuals develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of infected individuals.
In the epicentre of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate, and not all deaths related to VOCID-19 may have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people may have antibodies, according to an evaluation of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed to be related to IDVOC-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in humans in studies in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among 50-year-old men, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at age 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The precise reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioural factors may be part of it.
Immunological differences by sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and the development in men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of deaths from VOCID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government did not collect data associated with the type of OVCID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women and are at increased risk of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "VOCID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: December 31, 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or group of individuals, in accordance with international classification recommendations to prevent stigma. The virus that causes VOCID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "VOCID-19 virus" and "VOCID-19 virus" in its public communication.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of the provisional disease names 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of places in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names VOCID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity limitations of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it in a timely manner, a local startup re-designed and printed the required 100 valves in one night.
After the initial epidemic of VOCID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to some other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against VOCID-19 is currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY trial" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response of the human body in the event of a new infection with VOCID-19.
A second strategy, sub-unit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain sub-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the S-spicle protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new technique for creating vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied to the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluated previously approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Converted antiviral drugs make up the majority of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials on remdesivir in several countries whose reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of candidates for vaccines and drugs against VOCID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of VOCID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
Preliminary data suggest the efficacy of remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some require independent research analysis.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that twice this dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorization at the discretion of physicians treating patients with VOCID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against VOCID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for continuation of an in vivo study after low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicule protein starting with serine 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via ACE 2 receptor interaction.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of VOCID-19.
Cytokinetic shock can be a complication at later stages of severe VOCID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine anti-shock properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
It is in the process of a national phase 2 non-randomized test in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe form of the disease.
Together with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine shock, it must counter such developments that are suspected to be responsible for the deaths of some affected individuals.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, treatment with CAR T cells, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of RCC.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems of people who have cured VOCID-19 to people who need it is being studied as a non-vaccinative passive immunization method.
This strategy was tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action through which passive antibody-based treatment can generate defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, such as using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of serum from convalescent people, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of cured patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
