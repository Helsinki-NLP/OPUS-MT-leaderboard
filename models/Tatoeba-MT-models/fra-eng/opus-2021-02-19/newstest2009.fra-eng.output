At the end of the trade, the Prague stock exchange tipped into the negative.
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange retaliated its losses.
Transactions with the ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the start of trade, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed its fall the previous day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in shares at Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the plan to stabilize the American financial sector, is thus also noticeable in our country.
Falling stocks in Asia
On Tuesday, the Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall, even though the clues managed, during the day, to erase some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Hang Seng Index lost four per cent during trade, but later it erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to almost 2.5 per cent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange lost 3.8 per cent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney stock exchange lost more than five per cent, but ultimately losses were reduced to 4.3 per cent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 per cent.
"The hesitancy about the rescue action in the US will affect financial markets around the world," observed Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its own monetary policy, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are the same as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will be affected.
The bloodbath of American actions
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the project to support the financial system, to which it should have spent up to $700 billion (nearly 12 billion from Kč).
Legislators thus deny the call for support for President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American stocks experienced a bloodbath and the main indices of stocks experienced the biggest fall of the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index lost almost seven percent, having fallen to such a scale for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in a free fall.
Congress gave in: US government can inject $700 billion into banks
U.S. Congress leaders and President George W. Bush's government have agreed on a broader form of the U.S. financial assistance agreement.
It will be put to the vote early next week.
The US legislators made a decisive turning point in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of US$700 billion in financial aid (about 12 trillion crowns) granted to the US financial system.
But success is not sure.
In fact, before the Congressmans can publish the final version of the law and put it to the vote, they must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Says Sunday to Reuters Barney Frank, chair of the House's Banking and Financial Regulatory Committee.
According to sources, as early as Wednesday, the plan should a priori be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major first psychological factor in reviving financial markets.
Given the complexity of the mechanisms by which market aid can be effective, however, there will be a "disillusionment".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the form that the package of measures for market stabilisation should take," told the Bloomberg Agency, Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
According to her, the final vote could be taken on Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with the U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, in order to give the bottom of the government a final form.
It should buy from financial companies the unsaleable real estate assets that result in significant losses to financial companies and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
We still need to pursue this plan to restore markets, but I think we are there," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a considerable impact on declining equity markets.
According to Senator Democrat Harry Reid, the legislators are doing so that Congress will reach a final agreement by Sunday.
They want to calm down investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress' decision could affect Monday's trade.
However, for the time being, it is impossible to specify with certainty when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote, nor whether the negotiations are likely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by a particular problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
Nevertheless, the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount allocated to the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress feels that the programme is not fulfilling its function, it has the possibility of blocking the remaining amount, following two steps: first, an additional $100 billion, and then, finally, $350 billion.
Bush hailed progress in negotiations
Although the president can put his veto to this decision, Congress has the opportunity to put him in a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted of obtaining finances for the purchase of bad real estate securities, whose value shook, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President George Bush is himself pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
Chair of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, Chief Negotiator, said that legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors against losses, the arrangement of discounts, the progress of the plan on the axis of time.
The new law also provides for the limitation of these golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the programme and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance to homeowners, who have problems to pay for.
The government should negotiate new down payments for mortgages that it will buy back, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing debtors to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance's chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we don't know what the mechanism and the price of buying out the problem assets will be.
This will be crucial in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week at the iHned.cz server.
If the plan is to be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, is, according to Marek, not as important as that.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree, this week, that they support this plan and that they dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological meaning of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, is the most important at the moment," Marek stressed.
An extreme struggle: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
It seems clear from this that it is better to buy only one phone.
However, there are sufficient reasons to obtain an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a high-end expensive gramophone to put Maxim Turbulenc's new album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl, and from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are piled vinyl records in your shelves, with rock art, jazz or blues, you probably dream of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music during travel, namely compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
Here too, there are categories according to price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would find it difficult to support headphones purchased for twenty crowns on the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are functions unknown, of course, to most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Besides the primary functions, phone calls and text messages, it is able to play music and movies, record them, it has a camera of varying quality and can, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if you take Smartphones and communicators into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no fridge knows how to grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are almost witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal nature of the motive is not without its drawbacks.
The larger the number of functions you use, the smaller the interval between two reloads.
And reading music is one of the most important energy goinches.
There are few mobiles that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this respect, the music players (especially the most rudimentary ones) are significantly better performing.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you sometimes call from time to time, get, to be sure, a second reload for work - this is valid even for more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, who are able, following a reload, to continuously operate for at least 9 hours, including the least performing ones.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices have a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without a special software.
Of course, you can record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without any reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in mobiles.
As far as readers are concerned, you do not need, except in iPod, any software.
Just fill, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create themselves a media library classified according to the interpreter's name, the title of the album, the style, or then according to the judgment of the user.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, like the Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iiver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
In the choice of a concrete device, focus on the lifetime of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it only for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading MP3.
Virtually all mobiles are now capable of doing so.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to play.
All manage to play the MP3 and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have precisely this format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also read music in WMA format.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
You just have to visit the corresponding web pages of the operator (or of another supplier) from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason for obtaining a musical motive.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and in most cases is limited to fast tube radios.
Nor are prices the lowest.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, the Internet, or even the wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their motive on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have headphones on you or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use built-in speakers, which have virtually all the mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical mobiles is their price.
The cheapest normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, one can have a walkman already very suitable.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of an output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best equipped, also equipped with an entrance for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Really anyone manages to ensure the control of the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the control to that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is evident.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of a mobile internet connected by chance, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models support in principle only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive get away with even 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iiver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, choose specialized mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and thus the ease of control is closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series mobiles have the same user menu as separately sold MP3 players, is the one that went the furthest in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a lifetime of the battery (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) higher, is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the above mentioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering almost the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we are still missing something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned, on several occasions, on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTÚ (Czech Telecommunications Office), which pointed out that the price of an SMS was higher for us than for the rest of the Union, confirmed this.
Thus, following the European Commission's latest steps in the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may arise - SMS messages sent from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this regard, Pavel Dvo+k, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), who has repeatedly stated that in Czech Republic there is no longer room for another operator, has been chorused with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with his own network is apparently no longer very lucky (more so, he would find frequencies difficult now).
However, there is still one possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a considerable drop in prices, to which conventional operators had to react afterwards.
Yet, even before the entry of party troubles such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market, voices similar to those heard today at home were heard in Britain.
However, it became clear that there was room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you about the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator has managed to win over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator in the country.
Let us add that behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which owns among other things the U:fon in Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators being the opportunity to focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
Thus, in the world, virtual operators are emerging as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers text messages in Britain that are at least twice as expensive as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity move.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"True men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work at home as well.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesman for Vodafone, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services."
In Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in Czech Republic the negotiations are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area," said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta Financial Group.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to prevent a potential competitor from appearing.
The GTS Novela Group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of business customers, has not been hiding, for long enough, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We are keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility several times with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to move forward in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl's spokesman.
The future may therefore be promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that we might be able to host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific ones.
For the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this field has contacted us," said Vlastimil Srše+ of the Telefonika O2 press department, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokesperson Martina Kemrová states in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
She adds: "It is virtually impossible for a virtual operator to appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited period of time, we should have a concrete agreement now."
Vodafone instead directs his attention to completing requests to obtain his own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This, in our view, means the most input from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to set up a common network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities: in line with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, would lead to lower prices and thus lower profits.
So what is the point of facilitating the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to say that they are throwing away at the fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also testifies to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on the ČTÚ, at the time of the creation of the U:fon, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the ČTÚ web pages.
Today, however, the U:fon lends itself to using as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted on this subject: "Competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile RT market, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject him, and especially his services, to high demands."
But given the attitude of mobile operators, the indifference of Czech regulators seems disconcerting.
However, it is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
The latter belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
However, the latter adopted its typical position in the face of this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question concerning the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at the moment, as the offer of potential interested parties has not a priori presented sufficient interest for conventional operators," said Kristián Chalupa of the External Relations Department of the ÚOHS.
A statement formulated in this way would not surprise representatives of operators.
But on the part of an Office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care of the fact that no one takes advantage of their position on the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
All the more so since Kristián Chalupa adds: "In other countries, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a drop in the prices of mobile telephone services."
However, putting pressure on the honest functioning of the market and falling prices is apparently not part of the interests of the ÚOHS.
What is indeed shocking is the almost touching harmony of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, arises quite naturally.
Similarly, a price of gasoline that is strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to the chance and hard fight of competition.
"The Office has not noted any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, and therefore none has a corresponding increased responsibility for its conduct on the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even from the telecom regulator," said Chaloupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of discord.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different vision: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, it is necessary to obtain, on each occasion, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
This is how he necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
Even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are proceeding visibly in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including GTS Novela, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Making responsibility fall on the ČTÚ is a fairly common turn in communications, through which the ÚOHS washes its hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted Telecommunications Act has not succeeded in making the ČTÚ's powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications more visible, although many specialists are promising an improvement in the situation.
This, the representatives of the ÚOHS must know very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work.
That said, the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operators, many in Czech mobile networks, remains undetected.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services, but the latter are only partially public.
In most cases, there is talk of firms involved in multi-level marketing.
Specific mobile telephone services are offered, for example, by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually reach only elected officials.
The magic trick consists in the fact that the company makes in front of the operator is a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she obtains special (and other) price offers.
What is problematic is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you're talking about happened, it could be a breach of the contractual terms that we would be examining and that could lead to a cessation of collaboration with the company in question," answered our question about this Martina Kemrová problem.
Nevertheless, it is rather unlikely that an echo of such an activity has reached the managers of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
Ancun operator, however, does not rule against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these companies bring them non-negligible benefits, and at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of the ordinary customers of mobile operators."
That is precisely what should seem strange to the ČTÚ.
In addition, there is another question to the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has relatively broad powers to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions forbid it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a considerable drop in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, traditional operators tried, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were virtually the same - a market that was too small, if not too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that regulatory bodies in developed countries have intervened, not defending the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both formal measures and informal pressure resulted in the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulatory agencies are treating this issue like a hot potato that is being disposed of by passing it on to a nearby target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than beneficial to them in these cases.
But let's not throw the sleeve after the punch.
If the behind-the-scenes information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear in our home, the Czech mobile market may get back on the move.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will hardly be able to remain impassible in the face of the rejection (of discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling it more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Czech Citizenship Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was recorded again by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji+ Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with choir and an instrumental version.
The singing is performed by Kateřina Kn+nková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem.
You can listen to the four new versions on the server iHned.cz.
Bělohlávek considers Czech national singing one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose for the performance solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to take care that the two singers, as well as the choir, had a good diction, so that the words could be understood correctly, that they could sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj first sounded in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetteiers), an original Czech play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škrup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse naturally became part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
Pragois public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip into their ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, it is accessible for about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day or 90-day coupon (this coupon will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both have it registered on their smart card in the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádra+ Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Let+any, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons by internet on the web pages of the Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who start using the online store can finally forget the ticket counters in the metro stations, where they had to trample impatiently in long queues so far in order to get paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon by internet and will be recorded on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these contact points, passengers are provided with a counter with trained staff, who will help them with the purchase via the internet and, in addition, will record the coupon they bought on their card," says the spokesperson for the Martin Optrný project.
Besides libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, remind the machines to compost the tickets and the passengers have perhaps already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today the city has five, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," added Optrný.
An automaton will control the coupon instead of the driver
The automatons that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Simply introduce the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city.
In particular in peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the central Bohemia mainly use to access the capital.
"In the trains integrated in Pražská integrovaná doprava (integrated transports from Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of Filip Drápal tickets of Ropid organisation, which designs the timetables of the public transports in Prague.
The peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's box.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the indicated place on the side of the car.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Drápal completed.
Passengers who do not take peri-urban buses and do not remember the date when their coupon validity expires, can join the vending machines again, initially used to record coupons on the card.
This is where information about the validity of their document will be displayed on the device's screen.
The Sudetes called for a referendum in the USA
The Germans of the Sudetes demanded in 1945 that Šumava be integrated into the United States.
This follows from a letter filed in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the Southern Bohemian).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, certain groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly addressed the president of the United States with such a desire.
This stems, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans from Český Krumlov ask in the letter the American President not to allow "šumavská župa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and want to be truly sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "People, to whom the fate of the Šumava is close to heart".
Since the rallying of Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, disrespectful attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take in his hands the protectorate of Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and destroys minorities and that has in no way contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into consideration the opinion of the quarter of a million inhabitants," is written in the letter.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans in Šumava, he would simply have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, in view of current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the then Sudeten Germans.
While the Czech Germans had at least to see that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some were waiting for the United States and Great Britain to gain some kind of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German of České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the English and placed in the capture camp of the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," said Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, according to him, felt that, following Beneš decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You're not thinking - you're paying!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way of characterising the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The Office of Minister Aleš Öebüek believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, the internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving quickly and driving alcohol.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, it wants to touch the consciousness of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also reflected in the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You're not thinking - you're paying!
The phrase "You don't think" is capitalized on the license plate.
Then, in a puddle of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
Which must symbolize that one can pay for life for a moment of inattention.
The spots will "hanter" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where one can see commonly images with drastic images of the victims of accidents.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whip against drivers
"What works with drivers is the system of sugar and whip.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time when they burn a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded to the drivers," says Martin Ko+n, the transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertisements, according to the psychologist.
According to him, signs that signal danger to drivers are already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns against a danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the drivers won't notice it again," Ko+n said.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli interim government, supported the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all (occupied) territories, or even all," Olmert said on a daily basis.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), since otherwise peace will not happen," he added.
He agreed that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert remarked, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, during which several people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places" located inside the Old City.
"Anyone who wishes to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he stressed later.
Golan Heights retreat
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's retirement from the Golan Heights, which, in his view, was an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollah (Shiite Movement); they will have to give up the constant support they give to the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite Movement), Al-Kaida (Terrorist Network), as well as that of Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident on the bus of the Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can travel within the coach during the journey.
"If one wanted to strictly and formally respect the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road to the coach.
The girl was, unfortunately, sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the coach may have an accident or even a sudden brake, also when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is equipped with standing or not.
If this standing equipment is not approved, passengers shall remain seated.
The Student Agency long-distance buses do not have standing seats; this was confirmed in Aktuálně.cz by the director of Radim Jančura.
"This is an issue that we dealt with with the department and, at first, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got the passengers to go to the toilet during the journey provided they had their own seats," he revealed his position.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the steward role - there is no legal requirement to deal with that role.
On the other hand, there is no legal requirement to prohibit the carrier from offering services.
The law on road transport only knows the term "receiver of a vehicle"; it does not define its rights and duties," adds the spokesman Hanzelka more ambiguously.
Josef Pokorný, the head of the road traffic department, believes, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently addresses the problem.
"It depends on the fact that the coach has permission in its approval to offer standing places.
Everything is in there," he says.
The coaches are divided into urban areas, where there are standing places and a limited maximum speed, intercity with standing places and a higher permissible speed and long distance coaches without standing places with the highest maximum permissible speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Ho+n, expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) in transport safety, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft.
There, too, it is not sure when turbulence will occur and the air hostess can hit her head."
"Now, in the event that the coach would have stopped abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards with internal requirements," he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jančura is ready to abolish these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer steward services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their job to be a risky job.
"Nevertheless, as soon as I feel that this is a risky job, I will delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper upon boarding.
It would also reduce costs," he says.
The safety concern is the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles by the director of the Asiana Alexey Litvine, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hostesses. We've been opposed to them from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," he said a year ago in Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has happened
A young hostess from the Plze+ region, who had been working for the company for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop strip without using a blinker and blocked the way to the coach.
The driver of the latter tried to avoid him by means of a sudden maneuver, but he approached him by his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards have been sold.
"In the case of long distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but as far as the financial compensation is concerned, it also relies on the guilty party.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the Act, which has been being prepared for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarification on the travel of stewards on board the coach.
"However, it did not reach any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile while driving," says expert Ho
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," concludes spokesman Hanzelka, stating that the control of the safety of coaches is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfese rest on Frankfurt.
The big words were not lacking in the letter from the WestLB steering committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institute with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse financial group" could be formed, according to the letter made public on Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "bloc of competence" and sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive starting point for further mergers in the Länder banking sector.
This is what it looks like when an Executive Board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the wounded WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority that has, only recently, made clear to the government of North Rhineland-Westfalia that time was running out in the search for a future solution.
However, for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side - there has been talk of a relationship of some kind between Deka Bank, which knows the Sparkasse customers through their investment funds, and WestLB.
Certainly the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas informed during the presentation of the figures of the semester at the end of August that he saw no meaning in the merger of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, either Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Deka Board of Directors, each half of which is supported by the Länder banks and savings bank groups, has instructed the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB for joint commercial activities.
This could then be the debit of the financial market, or parts of it.
However, the talks have only just begun, it is said in the financial centre.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, with its 3000 employees, counts for one of the largest employers on the Frankfurt financial centre, comes into play when it comes to the consolidation of the savings banks sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a while that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Land Bank of Rhineland Palatinate and Halbab.
Nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
Barely the plans had been made public that the government of the Land of Hesse was ruling against any Hellaba participation in them.
Subsequently, neither did the other two houses join.
The bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate was attached instead to the bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new deals on the consolidation of Deka-Bank with banks in Länder.
Finally, Günther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba steering committee, had, however, ruled against any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
Apart from this, there seems to be a growing feeling that the consolidation of the various institutions in the public sector is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a union between BayernLB and the Baden-Wuttenberg Land Bank could take place first and foremost.
For the Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure for further mergers were to increase, the potential partners would gradually escape it.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has so far resisted the crisis better than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
The grouping of savings banks and transfers of Hesse-Thuringe, which owns 85 per cent of the capital of Helaba, however, made a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
The NordLB would remain rigorous.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one of the facets.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can be combined.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely, which business model should ensure the future capacity of the Länder' banks, had not so far been resolved by the German grouping of savings banks and credit transfers.
In the long run, a WestLb dewetting could take place, deweaving which is obviously not desired here.
This is also mentioned in the letter from the current Executive Board: in any event, a 'global solution' would be sought for the establishment.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, near a five-litre barrel of beer from the Kaiser brand, stands a well-built bearded who shows about 200 visitors of the beer festival what deep sounds his gosier can produce.
Elena taps Luca first, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the station Puorta nueva, four buses take this evening the departure at 11:45 pm, `destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arrival scheduled at 6:30 am.
Three buses are reserved above all for Italians, on one of the buses travel brasilens exclusively.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing from the back and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, Marco Guarda explains, it's not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with false fur and glasses with wide silver frames.
For the past five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three fired just this year.
They go at night, stay at the party, and come home at 10:30.
Spending the night there would involve unnecessary costs, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a leader of the German speaking group - Marco did a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses drive in the night on the Autostrada direction `Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet on the bus, travellers sleep.
It's better that way, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while many other buses with Italian license plates will once again take a break shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco's group finally arrives at 6:30 p.m. as planned in the parking lot near Place Thérèse, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First: comb the small yellow cap.
Above is written to the left `Beer festival', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency `conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: 'When the doors of the beer tent open, we run,' shouts Marco in the early morning.
`Run!' Run and reserve seats at the back of the tent.
`Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, we must distribute them in the room!'
The chop, shouts Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the instructions!
`Show security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: 'Tonight, come back here at ten and a half!' Understand?
And that's it, it's gone to the beer party.
On the way, someone drowns yellow caps with trees to find the path, signs and even an electoral poster of a great Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the Italian 'weekend'.
There are no precise figures; 50,000 people are talking about getting on their way across the Alps and collapsing in the beer kiosk, 10 per cent of the visitors would have come from Italy on purpose this weekend.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven South Tirol policemen, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which produces statistics on the countries where the Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the Hofbräu brewery tent.
Nights of insomnia for Hypo Real Estate shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance that the politician used the word 'relatively' and slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This one happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), on the side of the DAX, obtains a credit of one billion from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
One person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits are granted up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background, the company-daughter Depfa bears the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced himself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since the mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and the own capital rate had also decreased slightly from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Current and net profits from financial transactions had fallen to zero from the same period in the previous year, profits from the allocation of specified receivables and securities and the termination of provisions in credit transactions had fallen from more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
And it was only because of the large profits from the repayment of the downstream accounting costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as from the repayment of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for the Konzern companies that the earnings deficit of about 16 percent proved to be moderate.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier had initially miscured on industrial loans for real estate, which had subsequently been filialized at Aareaal Bank.
Because conventional state financing was not profitable enough, Depfa had subsequently become more involved in infrastructure projects and in joint financing between private investors and the state (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the company-daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must carry out depreciations which should have on the calculation of the gains and losses of the group an essential material effect which remains nevertheless rather vague.
The fact is that the dividends have been cut.
Already for 2007, they had been truncated by two thirds.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing in the interbank market since it has no customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of credit between banks again fell considerably, the banks having accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs an annual part - about 50 billion euros - of all Depfa's loans for a short-term refinancing average.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing requirement is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets which are currently largely out of working order.
Other sources say that refinancing would be ensured through the funds until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the Executive Board of HRE Georg Funke explained, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to resort to financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for the Supervision of Financial Services (Bafin) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Group is now assured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors can only hope for this.
However, given the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in its entirety.
But neither can the opposite be ruled out.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest press releases, still at the door of insolvency Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue at least temporary will not succeed to reassure the minds either.
The share price fell from 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are particularly good.
While debt in the first place has barely moved, the prices of second-rate loans are falling.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former daughter company Württemberg Hypo and those of course that have a life beyond 2009.
The bonds of the bank Hypo Real Estate previously seemed to be an alternative speculation investment, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the very institute that brought the crisis into the establishment by the takeover of the bank Depfa.
As long as the issuing institutions, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that arrears will be eliminated over time.
Or it will happen what no one dares to hope at this moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that approached safety has now become a simple, well-founded hope.
This should set aside sleepless nights primarily for long-term creditors on whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they drew a line from to represent a carry-over of losses for the next few years to the next tax on capital income from automatically collected stock gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is due for the first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start to laugh: German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new exchange log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
What was I excited about?
Already the way to school scared me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train for 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way by myself, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be fixed as strictly as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students appear one after the other from eight o'clock, until at nine o'clock minus twenty, a round table begins with the teacher, the home room.
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my foster mother, as well as a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I showed up in front of the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all done low masses, laughed and made signs, and I have constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him thanks to my mangas.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable to the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "cute, cabbage".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was assailed in the rules.
Everyone was talking to who better, laughed and asked me a lot of questions - in this case, it's pretty hard to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all released their Bento.
My foster mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something other than the miserable German snacks.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, a cucumber salad and seaweeds, fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat right here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
What's for sure is that everything is really good.
All right, except maybe the candied salt plums, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and that is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of getting a little better acquainted with the boy during the break.
I read this in my mangas.
I'm curious to know if I could watch it here, too.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
So I always said:
"Because it fascinates me, what?"
In the end, reading mangas is what I've preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the mangas and the culture there, at one point I also began to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, us and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost here, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I have ever seen."
Rats also have sensations
A rat or cockroach flees from danger, does that mean he also feels fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having so far been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the questions of feeling or in general consciousness, we enter difficult terrain because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a similar subjective experience.
However, I do not believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our subjective experience to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
At the very least, therefore, for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, among which is the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even different from the other primates.
Another significant feature could lie in the linguistic nature of man: a large part of his existence being related to language, this often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever the way it is produced, would probably differ a lot from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, is neither measured nor, because of this particular Hardware, analysed on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses great problems for us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
The processes of animal consciousness could be examined without taking into account their content, and this is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also emphasizes the weight of the prefrontal Cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what does this mean for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its aftermath, like the reactions of the body) grabs the vivid memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volubile nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to attribute them to other than ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that the sensations from primitive activities arise in the areas of the body sensation of the Cortex and the brain stem, as does Jaak Pankseep, who however focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could quite participate in transversal sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe that this is indescribable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in both men and rats is probably also felt to be fear in both cases: how can one verify whether rats and men feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach flees from danger, but if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behaviors are not sufficient to prove identical experiences.
Admittedly, nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem causing the sensations?
And even if we could prove this for humans: how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is being made in the nervous plane as the same is being measured in rats and in humans.
Since I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, nor the sensations, I don't know if they exist.
This could be considered short-term, but I prefer to move on rather than constantly knocking on a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotion.
Platini, UEFA President: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government considers UEFA's decision in Bordeaux to be a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise, in collaboration with Poland, the European championships," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both guests run after the deadline.
The number of stadiums for the European championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed," said President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA keeps our eyes on us."
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The committee had met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act properly," said Drzewiecki of the Polish PAP news agency.
"We assured in a letter to the President of UEFA that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League have already been convicted in the previous season for manipulating compulsory relegation; in the end, the beginning of the League even had to be shifted to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignant counter-attack
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about her private life in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan lifted the veil on her former adulteran Dennis Quaid.
He's foaming and counterattacking.
A late Rose War for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are engaged in an unsightly battle - in everyone's sight and knowledge.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis was long unfaithful to me, and it was very painful."
She would have known the extent of deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his characterization as an unfaithful husband was clear: it would be "Monstrous", this one told the "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg reworks again the history of our relationship and manipulates it".
It would also be "reprettable", that "the pain and upheavals of a divorce for each child are revived again in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid remarried and soon became the father of twins.
Thus was his answer to the scratch: "In any case, my life continues.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's doing the best."
Airfare and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights in hotels were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced by up to 50 per cent.
Flights and hotel nights would have become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by the American Express financial and travel service provider.
The company analysed its reservation data for the first half of 2008 and established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a sharp decline in profits in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities examined by an average of 6.9 per cent compared with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay between 30 and 37 per cent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would reside for American Express in the low price of the dollar that led to a "decreasing travel desire of American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by lower hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices stand with a 26.3 percent increase, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was upwards in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in kerosene prices, economy-class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, which were fuel-intensive, even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, economy class ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, in business class and in first class, however, price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 per cent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 per cent.
The German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
On the one hand, the reasons for this fall in prices would be weaker economic growth, explains the firm.
Demand would yield ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure from the Open Skies Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the abolition by airlines of unprofitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet in the first half of 2008 - there were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first in the rankings.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not been able to find an eleven functional.
Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player did not enter the game until late and his shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," Hermann Rieger whistled in the dressing room of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn't much going on in the locker room, the half-time was over and most of them had sat down for them.
Rieger was for nearly three decades the physiotherapist of HSV, he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that's why his application was received in strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquiesced and lifted his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief coach Martin Jol.
Of which the orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
Putting it into practice has failed.
"Not everything was very beautiful to see today," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhard would have "souhaite also be more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 in half-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful head strike by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a bad win," said Marin Jol.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate its 121th birthday on Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, the fans celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional classification tables on the giant screen that marked their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to step back," said Marcell Jansen.
He doubted that the intermediate result of the table more reflected the unpredictability of the first League than the domination of his HSV.
The team with its latecomers - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, goaltender Petric as well as Jansen debauched from FC Bayern - is slowly forming, but it does not yet shine.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol demanded.
After the vote failed
On Wall Street, fear is circulating.
Early news of the failure of the rescue plan caused the Dow Jones temporarily to drop by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a little bit.
At about 2030, the world's largest stock market index was 10.579 points, with a drop of well five percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange Index was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The most losers of the Dow Jones were at that time American Express which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could profit any more.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares fell by almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, the big investor Warren Buffet had partnered with the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilised for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the amount should not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the government should recover options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged in relation to price developments in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
The price of actions sucked into the whirlwind in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not make up for investors' concerns.
The course of action of the great German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax towards the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index collapses despite the government's planned rescue of the financial market.
Spectacular declines in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The share of Bavarian real estate financier has lost three quarters of its value at times despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank has experienced a decline of more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped well below the large psychological bar of 6000 points and stood at 5.839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
All over the world, equity markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street was opening with significant losses.
Investors were concerned that the US government's $700 billion heavy bailout plan might not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10.809.25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The United States House of Representatives intended to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote should follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also had only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index showed a drop of 3.2 per cent at the moment, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11.743.61 points after a 1.26 percent increase.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 per cent to 18.286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 per cent, and closed at 12.595.75 points.
In MDAX, Arcandor's shares fell after an increase in capital was announced.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourist multinational has also indicated that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers perplexed: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational support manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has flown into space.
Because of soon frozen fuel conductions, death threatens her.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused disarray among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes, by which they obtain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, the Earth for example.
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the solar probe Ulysses.
This is what has surprised researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent of the way they are expected according to the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear in the speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized him with the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study still believes hard as iron that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near the Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, black matter still represents a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-release shooting, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
The ransom negotiations would already be under way.
The Germans are constantly in the kidnapper collimator.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are obviously free.
This was communicated in concert by Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the reports of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages were released.
We're checking their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and Romanians as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are doing well and are safe, said Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting prior to the release of the hostages remain unclear: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the abduction, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without shouting at the station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the agent.
All we had to do was collect the hostages, when suddenly, "this surprise" happened.
Sudanese soldiers killed six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt this Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded from Germany a ransom of EUR 6 million; the money had to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers found a safe way to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this account.
Abuse of a father-in-law who led to suicide
A court was informed that years of abuse by her father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent assault.
The High Court of Truro referred that he regularly bound his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Ms.Randle, 34 years old, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise tied her up and bandaged her before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother worked at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, a volunteer with National Trust, was haunted by the abuse she had been subjected to twice a week.
The Attorney General, Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had since 2006 seemed "emotionally dead," and "had lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's father-in-law, who had written a confession letter which ended with the following words: "I tied him up and bandaged her regularly".
"I didn't sexually abuse her.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are really weird as a fetishist, your victim must have been terrorized, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the suicide of the victim.
And what is even more surprising is the fact that if she had not done this, her story would certainly never be over in court."
He added: "I stress in particular, as his father and mother describe it, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising and successful young woman today."
Conviction for loss of official data.
The ministerial officer of the Cabinet Office who had forgotten top secret documents on a train in June will be condemned by the Official Secrets Act, known to the BBC.
The Department of Defence man was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents passed into the hands of the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that this case would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
An employee who cannot be appointed is charged with a violation of section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the highly sensitive nature of his work related to the Associate Committee of Secret Services
The documents he lost contained assessments of Al-Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret place.
Building companies facing invoice B&B.
British construction companies may have to pay a bill of over £80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million savers of Bradford & Bingleys.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect the money from savers, including 59 construction companies.
The General Manager of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said it is "irritating" to know that companies and their members will have to pay for the broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are released.
But the interest that will at the same time increase, will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that harvest deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that all 59 construction companies are included in this list.
It's irritating to see that institutions that have behaved prudently... now have to pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is claimed that each company must pay a sum in proportion to the deposits it holds, and that intermediary companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will be £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the commercial committee of the building companies, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It's "irritating" to see that institutions that have behaved prudently when the real estate market is resumed, now have to pay for institutions that are much less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, dates back to the first annals.
"We need to look at all aspects of this case in the coming weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent the building companies and their members from paying this salty bill," said Mr. Cole.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for the entire year, which could indeed double.
Since construction companies are non-shareholder organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five penny per litre
People in Jersey have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk, by five penny per litre, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase that followed a two-penny increase in February, following a search by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide if they go in turn, increase the price to consumers.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had last changed in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh was denied bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a bail application to former PM Sheikh Hasina, who may thus be arrested on his return home.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to grant her bail because of her indictment for extorting a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729.000.00) while she was PM.
This case is one of the many accusations directed at him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's lifelong rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but her party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country's provisional military government first give her full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release were contradictory because if she was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request that she does not require bail because she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will make an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after 17 October, said a former leader of the Awami party.
She was detained last year after the interim military government assumed power, but was released in June to take care of herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina, like Zhaleda Zia, deny the charges against them.
Concern for the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign, due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
Last week, the United Nations carried out an immunization campaign in all six provinces.
However, she stated that she was unable to contact the children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located to the south.
A United Nations spokesman said that this happened despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstruct the thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the judicial battle of ITV
BSkyB lost its case following the verdict of the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival transmitter ITV.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its shares of ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and allowed it to influence ITV unfairly.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 as a result of an agreement to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from purchasing ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV's shares cast doubt on ITV's effective independence, thus prompting the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and the regulator Ofcom were all against this purchase.
BSkyB replied that forcing it to reduce its shares of ITV would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just renounced its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. prosecutor case.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special accuser to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole was born from the account of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officers, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Accusator Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation, lied to the investigators, thereby obstructing justice.
"Serious and unsubstantiated charges of potentially criminal conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his most important recommendations.
The dispute began with the de-listing in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were dismissed because of poor performance.
But then it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were not more criticized than their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to attribute a political connotation to these dismissals.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others reportedly refused to investigate accusations of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute judicial proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The head of the justice department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up being accused of being involved in this case of dismissal, and in the end he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers in the Department of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "the first person responsible" for these dismissals, and eventually "abdicate" his leadership role," remarkably succeeding in not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including Bush's former collaborator, Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic will have to be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honoured at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to get this recognition.
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds was the title of the hit of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The award evening is presented by Coldplay, with this year's selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly is one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was put on the market in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, ranking in the fifteenth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the English rankings, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, by her real name- has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing surgery to cure her irregular heartbeat, after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngite forced her to cancel concerts.
Then we found him a cyst in the vocal cords.
A Street Dark in the City, Often forgotten, and may soon be on sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis and long-time local residents don't know how to get to Extra Place because they've never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street-not to be confused with Second Street-between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 feet long, it looks like a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
. There are no signs indicating the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repave Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to shops and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-time neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because there remains one of the last and oldest streets of the block.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city, which manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the neighbourhood homeowners' committees, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal allowing the builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers to keep the street in the hands of the city, and asked for a new proposal to submit next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
"There are only a few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to restore it and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to refurbish the little street and install seats there, some of them would be used by a café to which the builder will grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokesperson, said that although the company wants to operate the street, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to remake this abandoned alley, and to make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest it sell."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation of Real Estate, confirmed that the city wished to sell the street, stressing moreover, that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has had this name since 1802, when the legacy of the large farm of the many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has remained abandoned since.
The later entrance to the CBGB, a closed punk rock monument in 2006, reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the picture in November 1976.
It was full of scrap, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution towards the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a real rarity - a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be destroyed in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who leads a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "Le Livre des Contestations: Un Regard Amérement Nostalgique sur Une Ville dans le Processe d'Extinction") tells the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The new Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac, dark by day and night, and bounded by the doors of a rusted iron warehouse and the Persians, full of newspapers of last week that fly along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
An agile rat at the bottom of the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and which has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, a bottle of 22 ounce empty beer, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown out.
Some passersby said they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Mr. Field, on the other hand, said that some people underestimate the attractiveness of the street in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have taken place in dark, damp and disgusting places."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former California student, and former head of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Thought. Why middle classes should be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Obama's campaign points out that "African-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students."
To combat these differences, Obama's education program supports in particular among so many other topics, "bilingual transitional education" for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education that defends classroom instruction in languages other than English is in addition to his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the east of Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are mostly Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of the students, made up of many new arrivals, study English.
Among the students of the CM1, 100% passed the 2008 state exam of maths, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English-language arts exam.
This incredible success was achieved thanks to an ingredient other than that advanced by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, constant assessment of abilities and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr.Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, this school introduced English language instruction "full immersion".
Total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Ms. Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you would have had no chance to identify him."
"It works," she observes, "it worked for us."
Shouldn't Obama take an example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in the other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education obscure the prognostic of Obama's response.
Although he is in favour of the fact that immigrants are learning English, Obama recently considered this issue insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop polemicizing about the language of English-language laws.
"On the contrary, he said, "you have to make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should consider carefully the models of education that work, rather than disdaining them or consider them insignificant.
Nette du Pétrole Fall following the News Concerns of the world of the Economy
Oil prices have fallen sharply on Monday, because people fear that the bailout plan for financial markets will bring the economy back to life.
The futures operations of crude oil, fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel. The New York Mercantile Stock Exchange, during sales this morning.
Prices have dropped by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, raw material markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil on Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After experiencing an increase of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in view of the deep uncertainties of the financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again worried despite the agreement on the rescue plan, the biggest in history, concluded this weekend by Congress leaders.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis is long-term.
In the very latest episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments took part in nationalising the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts have said that the frenetic negotiations of this weekend, concluded with the rescue agreement " seem to have failed to revive the market".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow.
"the outlook for global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors."
"we believe that raw materials cannot escape this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and in particular in China."
The bank's analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, were therefore forced to decrease by 20 percent, the oil and gas price forecasts for 2009.
The Feast of the Determinant Second Time for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending more time in the last eight seasons than anyone in Jets Shaun Ellis uniform, the defenseman thought he had seen everything.
He looked at the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Ellis.
The second phase began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played dirty under dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor of an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for another two touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from the half.
"I didn't get out of my zone," Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"he's a mediocre player"
"We were communicating extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles played wrestling, the defense beat the Cardinals' quarter back, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of the Bowens ball, may well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a goal of 20 yards taking an advantage of 34 to 0.
That was the best the Jets could score in a while.
"The Jets coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "second or third time?"
When he was told the two- the Jets let pass 21 undisputed points in the third time- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third time.
"A lot of points have been scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, surpasses his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, once again proved worthy of her title as the best runner of the century, after beating her own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win in 2:03:59 in an accommodative race on the flat, Gebrselassie beat his 2:04:26 record by 27 seconds last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career in which he won the world championship or world record for any distance, of the 1600metres of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing – perhaps exaggerated in today's eyes – that air pollution will increase his asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the finish- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of one mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted to background runners, contributed to the reduction of the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters, suffered from calf cramps two weeks before, and missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain brilliant, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I recovered last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the better."
He was blamed - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's African rival - for having orchestrated his races too much, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually counting on the hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering world records more than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie's abilities as a background runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. midway.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the lineheads disappeared.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final climb to get away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis came third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Englishman Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone to win the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical backache, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a skilful strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan riders to take a nice advantage, then surpassing them about 18miles 1⁄2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia came second at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, finished third at 2:25:01.
In a city in Part, the Orgueil and the trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the sunshine, the brilliant and the giant Orlando, is a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first black city to be integrated, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make nowadays." The city at five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and no prison".
It has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora Festival in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Renaissance Harlem.
And in various ways, the city she describes- became touristic thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project- remains a place apart.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was already in the 1930s, when Hurston told that Florida's black rural population was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "knows us so little, doesn't know what he's losing".
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has moreover invoked an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious from the perspective of the foreigner.
"We are very careful about how to tell the story," said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, a resident of the city's oldest parishioner.
"it must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of a black takeover and a community of almost 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of Southern black rural culture - sometimes disdained, sometimes acclaimed - that recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in Eatonville's image born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere books full of dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in Florida's guide transformed this city, located just outside Route 17, a road that crosses the often forgotten central Florida that culminates in a chapter of black history and human drama.
Audacious as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the property store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parties.
"passed the road to the left," she wrote, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its well-preserved gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can be used by passing people.
So, in barely a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with a self-government but also literacy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described reality well," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's young girls who Hurston immortalized, citing colorless songs played by men who praised their beauty."
She added: "some people did not like it".
We always remember Hurston as a lively and eccentric person, who often came back after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, on a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wore pants here, where even today, we are proud of the traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed at her.
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he also adds, swinging in his chair from the back patio that overlooks Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some grave in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no major commemorations or plaques for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy it offered to the world " said Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Public officials in Orange County wanted a five-lane highway in town to replace Kennedy Boulevard, a two-lane main street in the community.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the western corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over the mixing of races led hatred to the doors of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of young whites came to throw oranges or objects at people sitting on the side," said Mr. Franklin.
"a lady has even died."
They threw a watermelon from their car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" insulting rather than glorifying my race."
Residents are now proclaiming that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
"Black children used to be kissed - I remember well - we kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening too," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief director of the Safeguarding of the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until the teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white-I mean there's a cultural demarcation line here," said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, such as she, armed with a joyous self-confidence and guidelines such as:"How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited Hurston's anonymous grave and began to struggle to revive his reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, re-introduced it to American cannons.
The highway project arrived just when Eatonville's most famous daughter had regained her attraction.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider her a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the festival's inauguration two years later, and many returned in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the proposal of the highway.
"The five-lane highway fiasco, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd summed up the whole statement that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been with our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been listed as a historic city since 1998.
A single-themed library (renamed Hurston of course) opened in 2006 on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, repaved.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back street on a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(there are now 90 percent blacks)
Foreigners who come to discover the story of Eatonville, its raison d'être, are still treated with caution.
We must ask permission for most interviews, and certain things - like the walls of the old Eatonville church, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Miss Jones, a courageous teacher who has a soft spot for bright red, are still afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston Festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to regard Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, hardworking, crazy and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is true civic affection that is heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for younger ones, like 11-year-old Alondra and 11-year-old Alexia Kenon, twins at Winter Park, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people, who pass through this area, will think: "Oh, this city has not compared anything to others" Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it is a very beautiful city".
Here in New York, everyone speaks finance fluently.
Despite everything, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan kept away from the kiosk and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they're in the eye of the cyclone.
Never would they think that in the glass and honeycomb offices above their head, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst "working day at the office" since the crack of 1929.
Deliverers continue to sneak on the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
The Latinos always hang between residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke placed on his shoulders.
Office workers continue to line up to buy their morning sandwich from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite completely pessimistic accounts until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work in the late afternoon, as I discovered at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, about 20 people lining up.
Not in front of cashier's counters, not to withdraw the cash or make a payment, but in front of the customer service counter, where the usual customers ordered their chequebooks, tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would learn later from Starr, my "authorized personal banker," all lined up for the same reason I did.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that operate only in a state, and that claim to treat customers as their families.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327 capital bank, has used the bankruptcy trustee, and while New Yorkers were coming home for the weekend this Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and the store employees who are in front of me, scared of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that they think is reliable, the one that makes the most bailout on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the financial world in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket talking on the phone to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and her meager general manager Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, my building's uniformed concierge, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or my fruit and vegetable dealer's deliveries.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take a risk."
Muslim Tombs desecrated as Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organisation of "Cities Against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday 17 January 2008.
They carry road signs depicting mosques striped in red.
The police accuse extreme right-wing extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of extreme right-wing political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged in the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning; according to the police, this is an organized action.
The offenders painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as David's Star; however, detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise extremist hatred towards Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somehow linked to the elections?
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said he was "profoundly shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which occurred just during the religious month of Ramadan, which is coming to an end.
Austria is seriously thinking about regaining its courage, following its swing to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that won almost 30 per cent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, carried out an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered xenophobic, according to critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, led his campaign against the wearing of headscarf and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, defined the extreme right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad.
The courts have banned glamorous rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he had expressed his intention to visit Spain through France to the authorities under his control.
The police in Kent had issued this travel ban last Thursday after proving Glitter's guilt for child sexual abuse to the magistrates.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing in Ashford's limited courts, but was nonetheless represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said "Thursday, September 25 at Ashford Court, the Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr.Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until March 25th.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there then."
Glitter, 64 years old, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even if he wanted to be registered in the list of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years in prison.
The Kent police stated that they would not discuss any particular cases or the potential displacement of Glitter in the county.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said, "Kent police will do everything they can to protect our children as well as those abroad.
"In our view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have devices that can manage any potential risks in a much more effective way.
"Protecting the people of Kent is the most expensive intention of the Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, in order to minimize potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he should have boarded a flight to London.
But he said he was not feeling well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from controlling passports, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and was therefore forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge Limited Court, West London, for registration on the list of persons charged with sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a four-month sentence in the UK for holding images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travelling in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no clothes of bow.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where we discover with intimate gestures and stolen eyes artists who do not care to go on stage.
German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of a few stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programme of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "may be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists able to transmit on stage passion, sadness, joy ... by captivating the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists it is not necessary to make photos on stage.
They have their own personality and character.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera moments of personality of flamenco stars ".
With the festival "Chant populaire des Mines", Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, remakes classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises each day".
It is not about dancing or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the public with his art.
The search for essentials and magic has been the constant of this work that is presented these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Flamenco stars like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy artists photographed.
The project has turned into a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book collecting portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits de vieux sportifs" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a more or less long time.
I think that in photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you don't know or that just give you a few minutes to get a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the Galerie El Fotómata, located at number 20 of the rue de la Mata (rue parallel to the Peupleraie d'Hercule) which will be open until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "real daring"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he is working, a novel whose main character is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived for twenty years in Congo and who has passed through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize winner in Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay Segovia Festival, that the novel that currently occupies him "is a real audacity" and that "everything shows that he should not write it".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people march through the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award with the majority of the participants' voices, completed the stage at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself faced with a fascinated audience who did not see the past hour during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and a great dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst for reading" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote a "very methodical way" through intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting part of the text to face his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is pure fun, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less like," because writers were asked "not to let themselves go to frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather spoils Pozoblanco fair
The party of bandrilles that concluded the bull racing of the fair of Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday morning, after the toreadors on horseback checked that the arena was impassable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather was fierce at this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bull race planned.
In the poster, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who should have faced each other in the arena of Castilblanco
So only the Friday party took place.
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was worn in triumph, after having made arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetic.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two bandrils planted on the bull's back and a cut ear that the discovered stands applauded more than his fight with the bull himself.
Worse still for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the public.
Police control of a van in Alava province: 2,000 kilos of hashish found
Five and ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Euskadi police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Commune of Armin (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two begin the escape.
His load, more than two tons of hashish, enough to stop them.
The police officers prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A.A.J., according to information disclosed by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident took place when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle check on the N-1, at the border of the Commune of Armiñn.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, abruptly accelerated and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometres further on the lower side, where the two occupants descended to flee to a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hashish bales. Then they proceeded to transfer it to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drugs.
In addition, the officials found that the registration plate had been “falsified” since it did not coincide with the one written on the registration card of the van, which is also why they charged the detainee with an offence of falsifying documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the provenance of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old prisoner, A.A.J., was taken into custody to carry out the various procedures and will be tried in the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear stopped for driving under the effect of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her do strange maneuvers trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesman for the California police patrol revealed to People magazine.
The witness said that around 16:30, Locklear "pressed the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going back several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who initially did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and exited his vehicle.
That person, at that time, called emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented," which is why the agents took her to the drug and alcohol centre to perform a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the beginning, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested because he was suspected of driving under the influence of a substance that was not specified and was imprisoned around 19.00 hours and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat herself for a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the case Silva
The General Coordinator and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Councillor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of performing special treatment for members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares with regard to the behaviour of the political party that it will have to adopt in the city council of Seville.
However, the leader of the United Left has called for investigations to show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended such cases so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all civil servants".
"Sangre de Mayo", the dared bet of Garci
Drawing on the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous Spanish battle against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros in budget.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film lasting more than two and a half hours, "Sangre de mayo" will be released in the cinema next Friday, which will then become a TV series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós literature, José Luis Garci assured that he had made with this film "a child's dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago to make a memorial film for the two hundred years of May 2, Madrid, which he always accepted when the story was based on national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain which has been wrong leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions during the reign of Ferdinand VII", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding as for the films "Captain Alatrist" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he was unable to shoot a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated for most of his career.
The director of "Volver a empezar" has influenced his usual way of working, on the staging of the actors, with whom he is accustomed to repeating before starting the filming and to whom he does not cast, since it seems to him "humilizing" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and the cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" repeat in front of the camera, like Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times candidate for the Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de mayo", "Sept tables of French billiards" and finally the winner, "Les sunflowers blinds", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which deserves to be better known", he said.
With this movie Garci doesn't expect a prize.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, and then you realize that you're working only for prosperity, and now you're just making an extra movie," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón gets into the skin of the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillan dancer as well.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and a Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and who at the age of three will live in London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer specializing in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneer of the liberation of the woman, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe of the interwar period, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered me to perform the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me".
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" made me think of a Cuban popular dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to hers," she says.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done at "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with the one who was his pupil.
"Matilde turns Tórtola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me."
The production was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón, the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered as divas".
This work also tells, in a way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in places so far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think it is these women who have a huge influence in their time and now nobody knows and highlights her work," Bayón says.
The show will start at 8:30 pm at the Lope Theatre in Vega
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a newly married Poet" in St Stephen's Church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Zenobia Triennat and Juan Ramón " (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress which took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This poplar of light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling in the various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York during the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a newly married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America less likes without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them."
This phrase is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of malice", and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all of America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer in this world.
He had trouble getting an Oscar.
He hasn't turned since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of its existence."
No one was afraid to make themselves ridiculous or exaggerate.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly obscure period, when terrorists and stock markets were afraid, American esteem fell very low, desperately seeking grounds for dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, human beings only have admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the anti-drug fighting foundation created in honour of his deceased elder following an overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that struggled against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was the highlight of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He has set us the bar," observed George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who is trying to break through the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having serious privacy and away from goals.
It's still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there's the one trying, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even though he did not miss the opportunity not to be.
"But why should I eat a burger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?", he used to joke.
In heaven, he attends with pride the encounter of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
"Among all the great roles he has performed, he has never been more proud than that of the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring and philanthropist grandfather," he says.
Madrid in the race to organise the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organise Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst race I've ever competed in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of a eliminatory note.
But let's look at it in detail and from the beginning.
Mistakes begin with the removal of the bibs, which forces you to go ahead.
It's not bad, but if they make you move it would be better if they gave you everything (including the electronic chip for racing).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the bib (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size ' S ' for the jersey (second error, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small jerseys with less fabric and less expensive blow?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the races.
Apart from the fact that it is necessary to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, moreover, it is necessary to leave his backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible since 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions began and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and attacks took place at the barracks.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, will not even figure in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip that they gave me that, I think, did not properly mark the start.
Of course, if they asked me to give an example of a perfect race, it would not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympic Games.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Microsoft Emerging Technologies conference, a new system of image recognition and human interaction was presented, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move on the company campus) in response to what was asked of him during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are, who they are - including remembering what positions they occupy - and listen to and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them into conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking with her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks him if she's here to visit someone and she tells him that she will answer him in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked in addition to a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the essential instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on Google’s part to compete with Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary as this is the essential basis for understanding computer hardware and software.
He holds the same position as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but we must see the "death" of the operational system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operational system but more and more to the Internet browser.
We only turn on the computer to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
To whom do half of the applications provided with the system serve?
Who can do the most can do the least.
And Windows 7 will need to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, crowded, less complex months.
For now, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them a lot.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso supported him on the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the association of muscular gays.
And if we begin to list all his apparitions, we could also mention this strong moustachu who was lifting weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a simple cotton, tight, sleeveless men's body suit.
The English call him 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others.
First of all, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel ' stands out from the others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag ( barely recognizable) that the most famous bodywear have in its neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But she also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it's a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take very seriously their new activity in fashion.
According to Monica, they're not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion prizes that the Spanish company sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honour of Valentino.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 1950s and 1960s enchants us and we draw a lot from it for our collections.
I like to walk around town and watch women see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do it.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you're a very versatile woman: aren't you?
I think so, but in the end it all comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was very small I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's to look in my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers like to dress up very well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you put on the clothes, that's when you really put yourself in the character's skin.
So it's all connected.
You were not long 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30th birthday makes me happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl and it has given me a lot of internal happiness.
So, do you think you're a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me and, moreover, I want to become a young mom; I don't want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's get to the movies, you wait for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
It's true, I can't wait for them to come out.
I am a woman from the theatre, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course this is not possible.
I can't wait for the films 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo'.
Seeing what you'll think of it...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the bridge to make the model.
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for a long time, to invite me to take part in a charity parade in London for her association in support of women and the clothes we exhibited - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auction to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
People that Naomi is a person with a tender heart.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Besides, this so good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear tree, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the Third World.
Recidivists of alcohol driving will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcoholism to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting in a state of intoxication, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and it now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last one year.
Its aim is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State responsible for road safety but also the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Technological Institute for Motor Vehicle Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in a state of drunkenness, take over the car.
The alcolock would avoid this since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the breath alcohol level and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow forward; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than that allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is at the driver's expense.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced offences by up to 65% in the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people each year.
This is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: dealing with these behaviours before they turn into criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, however, reform by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system in school buses as it was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., the official scheduled time, the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of sunset, but its rays still required a visor so that the royal couple could get off the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours before I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official journey.
- Ah, all right, so we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this hour... are you from here or...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking two years.
- Ah, all right...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
There are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military row composed of 27 navy soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when to her, has hair in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before going to the hall where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they live, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny journalist from Mexican television awaits them.
The most prestigious fashion award
There is certainly no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is certainly no living cartoonist more extraordinary and good live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be awarded a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in Mango's showcase at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost cried with emotion.
Certainly it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the competition, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
With the table next to the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having fat on the heart and making against bad fortune good heart, because of the recent death of her brother, Nati put on a mango garment and some ornaments of ELAH, which cut off the breath, and arm on, arm on, arm under with her son Luis - a handsome man nearly two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to her dinner prepared in her honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as Baron de Rotchil finished the night without a jacket because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner changed by wearing a sexy and black long dress, was moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsals room and remembering the good old times, she grabbed one of the bars and made the gesture of a 'big folded'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace's outbuildings, but she showed us before on her mobile phone pictures of her son.
The following morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another handsome man who travels by bike – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having asked beforehand, that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the number antistress
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of daily life.
And to top it all off, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to booksellers on September 30th.
The wake-up call saddens us almost when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it's even worse when we think about the restless rhythm that today's life imposes on us.
The office is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there is neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
Well, 1001, neither one more nor one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to everyone's taste and time.
The antistress work is entitled '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive in booksellers directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn't run through your veins to restore your body balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking while sleeping
Some children talk during the night.
I do not refer to those who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who talk during their sleep.
The first time this happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn't matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somnoloquia.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one who talks at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day after the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often linked to other sleep alterations such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (pee in bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stress or overexcitation.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, whispers or, on the contrary, with shouts, tears, long speeches ...
In the event that somnoloquia becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another alteration of sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are more or less violent.
With children who are very nervous and have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down inside.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the sleeping pills appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will no longer remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he talks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if it is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), don't be tempted to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because when he sleeps, he's not conscious so he can organize his thinking.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so be careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally.
Illhaeeurn finally found the way to victory on his field after a long period of famine.
Without making a big game, the Yellows and Blacks created the most opportunities and managed to transform one for the win of the game.
The pace was not very strong during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by visiting captain Kauffmann who was close to the skylight on a far shot, Illhaeusern would take the ascending slightly and turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn above, Romain from the end of the foot or Diebold came tickling Dannemarie's defense.
Opposite, we were in a block in the middle of the field and we just left the stirring Riahi at the point of the attack.
The start of the second half was to be decisive with first two occasions signed by Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to take back a ball pushed back on a first attempt by Diebold (53e').
But the Illhousian scorer will not be able to enjoy his happiness long and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose any big problems to an Illousian Eleven who just stepped back a little to "compact" his defense, except in the last few seconds of the game where, after a big bump, the ball passed very close to the transverse.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour by Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of strength of the fishermen who strongly disrupted the access of several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome it "in a constructive spirit" and hope that it "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit which falls at the same time as a general assembly of the "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of the soaring prices of diesel fuel, which reached a record level of more than 1.14 euro per litre on average.
According to the spokesperson for lElysée David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by the fishermen.
Tuesday morning, they conducted snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-Île were not stopped.
A filtering dam has been set up on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, as early as dawn, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to other ports on the Atlantic facade and the Channel, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where trawlers have remained docked, or Le Havre, where some 20 boats have blocked the movements of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped the blockade of the important Total Donges refinery in the evening.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide Tuesday on the follow-up to be given to the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go" and "don't want to travel to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but they estimate that the profitability threshold of a boat is only reached with a diesel less than 0.30 euro per litre.
Paul Newman the beautiful
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died from cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that loom over the world economy.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer looks forward to the Chinese market especially for its aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the US monetary authorities have bailed out, plans to divest more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion advanced to it, according to the Financial Times Sunday edition.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and its retirement activity in the United States, the newspaper which cites sources close to the file.
AIG's Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to discuss possible divestitures, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG plans to separate include its airline leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer, as well as its real estate portfolio and investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, continues the FT.
AIG must quickly realize liquidity to repay the loan of 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of the US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting due to the current shareholders.
Analysis Paris Session History Morning Meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen near the 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technologically dominant Nasdaq index yielded 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points, based on final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the sitting, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bank bailout plan, which was intended to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, representatives refused Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Almost two in three Republicans rejected his plan.
"This is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was counting on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would arrive "too late".
"If the project is indeed moribund (...) then the relay will be passed quickly to the Fed (the US central bank, ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions further," warned Brian Bethune, Chief Economist at Global Insight.
And further intensifying the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, stressed Ms Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, pushing for emergency interventions in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets are facing "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis," added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of the 10-year-old treasury bill fell to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% on Friday night, and the yield of the 30-year-old bill to 4.161%, compared to 4.357% the previous day.
Obama, winner at the points of the first televised duel
In Friday's first debate between the two White House candidates, he succeeded another to find out who, by John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honourable, has not been "bright enough" to stop his decline in the presidential polls to five weeks.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% versus 44% to McCain), judges that it was the Democrat who drew his pin from the game.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama came out victorious for 39% of those polled, while 25% of them gave McCain victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good performance expected of his parcelier, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's got good instincts," Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain has been constantly highlighting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while stressing his opponent's "naïveté" on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he has accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican TV commercials.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without disassembled, it was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still has not understood, while Obama, if," replied, this weekend, a Democratic spot telling the Republican not to have taken full measure of the impact of the crisis on the "street American".
"During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people for an election meeting in North Carolina in a heavy rain.
He did not even say the words "medium class" or "workers."The financial disruption clearly advantage Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most capable of saving the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"The coming week could be a turning point," said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final verdict of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that he would still be able to reduce taxes by 95 per cent of Americans in spite of Wall Street's turmoil, the Illinois senator also pointed out that achieving the country's energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudent, the two candidates diddged questions about the $700 billion (€470 billion) financial rescue plan adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice there was an election?"
Young people and opponents were protesting on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative elections.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening as soon as the polling stations closed in central Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some admit that they did not even vote: "What good is it, since they will do what they want with my voice," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has been good for foreign observers in order to resume language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turning point.
Sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered by observers to be clean.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not able to participate in the counting," lamented Yuuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our country, it is the executive power.
If opposition deputies enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for legislation."
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process may recognize the validity of the election.
She pointed out that participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalisation of advance voting (26% of the voters in Minsk) had opened the vote to all manipulations.
"You noticed that there was an election, you?" asked Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls back on the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec was celebrating yesterday the 10th anniversary of its founding, and its president, Dr.Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, as Héma-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
Most importantly, he regained the public confidence that had been seriously shaken by the blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and the grunt of the public, the Government of Canada initiated in February 1994 a public inquiry, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations that such a disaster should not happen again.
While Justice Krever was late in tabling his report, some provinces then set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Services to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began operations, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was disheartening.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground in the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said before proudly asserting that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile."
From its inception on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of mad cow disease were emerging in Europe, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, recounts the one that has held the fort since its founding in 1998.
"And we did not know at all whether this disease could be transmitted through blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when this is not known and a serious disease can result, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, measures of exclusion are introduced.
As a result, in April 1999, blood was refused for those who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, however, it was shown beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted through blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense."
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV testing technique emerged on the market: nucleic acid (NAT) tests, which directly detect the presence of the virus itself in the blood of donors and not the presence of antibodies against the virus, upon which the tests used so far were based.
The NATs made it possible to shorten the silent period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This substantially reduced the risk that some donors would be infected without knowing it and could not be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission from a blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover our health," says the Chief Executive Officer of Hema-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than last year on Reunion Island the Chikungunya virus, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," says Dr. Décary before pointing out that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient supplies.
"Needs are increasing because the population is ageing.
Because anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need red blood cells or platelets to recharge.
The aging population also affects the blood donor network, which accounts for an average of only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
A healthy person, 18 years of age or older who meets the eligibility criteria, can still give blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of those who offer their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a malaria-affected country, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But we need to renew the members of this donor network as they age and can no longer give blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give blood, but especially to hold them back and encourage them to become regular donors.
Since today's life is so unbridled, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving blood," desolates Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukaemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to collect more than one thousand a year.
We should start proposing them for transplants early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood program as very popular.
"Several mothers are disappointed to be unable to access it", because Héma-Québec cannot afford to offer this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - The Impact in the Semi-Final
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the playoffs in the first division of the USL, thanks to a 3-1 win (4-3 total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders yesterday in the second and decisive game of the quarter-finals in total goals at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of play.
After a first half without a goal on either side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other nets of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to defeat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that in the first round-trip game on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in the suburbs of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the 5-4 semifinal round in total goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Winning goal of Kovalev
The number one trio of the Canadian is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 win from the Canadian at the barrage fire against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Habs in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the sole goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable."
"He tried to overdo it in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation."
Charest bet on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out calling elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party was finished, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon in Quebec City yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected in today's by-election.
"Removing the boundaries of our last great frontier in the north": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in broad outline, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a sort of picture mill.
In a loop, on three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as in election times.
In the press, moreover, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would call the elections this fall, even though he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory in the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, simply explained why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but did not set a deadline, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be further developed: notably hydroelectricity, forest, but especially the mining sector, boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it's our home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it home, but it's in us," he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec has built up a lot in its relationship with the North, he pointed out: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister at the press briefing.
"This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government," he said.
Moreover, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open all year round due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the people of the Territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP for Ungava), have already begun consultations with some thirty communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Plan Nord will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal prime minister who preceded it.
"Like the Liberals who preceded us, we thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a big cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Centrale in Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the Nationalization of Hydroelectricity, to Bourassa who made James Bay, our party was able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
In the press, he cited another reference, conservative this one, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In approaching the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr.Charest noted that its commissioning was scheduled for 2012.
"It stays between us, but I plan to be there," he told his activists, causing them to be applauded.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling an election this fall, which the law allows.
He pointed out, however, that his schedule was fulfilled, notably by a mission of the federation council to China and a Québec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that passed as a letter to the post office: the PLQ in particular calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and that they would have the right to veto decisions made in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the main lines of the Plan Nord were greeted with scepticism.
The Pequist leader, Pauline Marois, emerged from the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, gave up its application.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today" commented Mrs. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (scrutin that is taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ expressed support for the government's adoption of a North Plan.
"But what we want is that it isn't just a show," commented leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is coming back from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (O irony) in Harper's office, who allowed herself last summer to say to Louise Arbour that she was a "honest" for Canada.
In doing so, we must put the reproach on this woman who has fought tirelessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration for the Prime Minister's entourage as much as on Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government which is the only one among all the Western countries involved not to have repatriated its national locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the charges against him.
The only government that, despite Canada's signature of the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier languish in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
For the record, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, are arguing for the repatriation of Omar Khadr to a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not matter that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We do not yet realize this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", a word that Harper keeps brandishing and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
Here comes the time when no morals exist any more: one can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a head of government so far minority (what then after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates the Truth, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice President of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has brought a defamation suit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without a penny in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation prosecutions, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr Garver.
For, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to lead to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the publisher of Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of mining.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will gag the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who dares to look again at the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Unlike in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada normally take place through the exchange of ideas and not through batons.
It was therefore enough for mining to open its books, its files and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support to Black Canada authors.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could both ask for a "public" debate while ignoring the views of the same public?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers only to lawyers who are highly paid and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even critics have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public that supports Black Canada's authors and publishers does so primarily because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a gag chase (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has also just put out a warning against Black Canada writers intimidating them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Garver's surreal discourse, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on academic research freedom and the quest for truth, which are essential to any democratic society.
It denies, as a whole, the right to quote credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss issues that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under pain of repeated prosecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by Black Canada authors.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has a long history of managing debates and disagreements and resolving conflicts.
The disproportionate pursuit of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss to the academic world, as well as to public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and Congress leaders, both Republican and Democratic, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new US$700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been rocking Wall Street for months still needs to be endorsed by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for failure to pay, and a right of scrutiny of the salaries paid to the managers of the companies rescued.
The U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and disruptions on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned into a sprint in the last few hours for fear of the effect that a new failure would have on the mood of investors.
The deadline was for the opening of the markets this morning.
Lately associated with the negotiations, the two candidates in the US presidential election were rather in favour of the agreement, but they did not fail to express their dissatisfaction that they were forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama agreed to add some provisions to the agreement, including the agreement to allow homeowners to keep their homes and the agreement on the salaries of government-backed business leaders.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be welcomed.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
Asked on another channel to find out if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The outlines I have read [show] that this is something that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to redeem with taxpayers' money the doubtful, risky and unsold debts of U.S. financial institutions.
After 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble which first led to the collapse of risk mortgages (subprimes) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and resulting in a liquidity freeze and the debanda of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of elected Republicans who had wrecked the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed that this impasse has been overcome since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round off the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added stating that if the government were to bear losses for five years with this program, it could introduce new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion to which may be added another 100 billion if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion should be approved by another Congressional vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will obtain shares in the rescued companies that will earn him dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to resell when the turmoil passes.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure procedures for housing related to the real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on the remuneration and severance benefits paid to the managers of the affected businesses.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and to that of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Votes continued yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camp.
"Obviously Washington can't hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, to his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is to benefit the taxpayers."
Moderator of a small group in Congress dubbed "the caucus of skeptics", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to tell us: we are asking Congress not to rush and to examine carefully the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas had indicated that it was refusing to acquire its competitor in the midst of a shipwreck since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the crisis of mortgages at risk in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not money lost," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In exchange, we get back a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that savers and households now appreciate that the times are uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to be nationalizing another bank misled by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, including more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would purchase the branches and accounts receivable of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty in the eyes of azure was for a long time his asset card, some will say his weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that flowed from the source will also have distanced him from the power register that gives birth to true sacred monsters.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, from lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fascination years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of which he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the break-up of dramatic conventions.
The mixed bloods often make beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, ultimate quality brand.
For in him a whole country of self-made man, of the combatant of the Pacific War, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theatre, on television, soon at the cinema.
The same man who militated for civil rights was also the motor driver who finished second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, coupled with a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the shadows of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to the flashes of the show-business, of which we will not have completely pierced the enigma.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
The disappearance of Paul Newman gave the cinemaphiles vertigo this weekend, as his great roles clashed on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation unfolds through it.
Return to remember the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a burning roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have come to history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, taken over after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This friendly villain in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and vengeful in Robert Rossen's The Hustler (1961), he took over the character on his return to Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which won him his only Oscar on nine nominations in 1987.
That face through the ages, it was him.
He's still here.
The eras rushed through his path.
Young people know him mostly through George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as sponsor of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
In contrast to several cinema legends who soon let go of the trade, Newman remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its fastes and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" considering his performances too supported.
The profession was not always tender for the handsome Paul Newman to whom the roles long fell all cooked in the beak.
However, he played less often the early young than the marginal ones: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed poorly known facets of his true modest sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former arms companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the disappeared actor.
Beyond his career as a legend, he also erases a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of Hollywood drifts.
We'll have seen a lot of her booze on dressing pots, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process to be quite tasteless, though gag at first.
The profits from these sales were nevertheless paid to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than sit on his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here."
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
A model citizen, in sum and in addition.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company make in their invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, resulting in particularly serious damage. Other charges have been brought against them, such as forgery and the use of forgery.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The state and municipal money, about HUF 65 million in total, went on the one hand in the funds of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to collect the money from the subsidies obtained by issuing cost invoices, behind which no actual services were provided and thus the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they obtained invoice books from the Józsefváros market, while they made the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's testimony, he had to locate pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices that they would introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András
During a "tracking circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlags in 2003, this place restored a group of 90 people, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület association.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up in the name of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which later became known as Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért, was full of errors of form and substance.
A board, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and up to ten people could spend the night there. However, the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty guests.
The over-imagining bill issuers also fell into excess when they mentioned Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. Neither the name of Jobb Jövőért nor the name of Hoppá appeared in their accounts, according to the information given to the prosecution.
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, told the website hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that they were false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a wrong place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the bill, a hundred people had lodged there, also did not stick, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much room.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The senders of zealous invoices also did not find out about the Budapest travel agencies, being part of their choice, but only organizing trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
From a surprise, as it appeared during the survey, they also added VAT on these documents, while services relating to travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices drawn up in the name of the Hotel Revfülöp to the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's services do not bear a 25% VAT, but a 15% VAT. Moreover, the employees of the hotel issue only printed invoices, while the fakes were written by hand.
The public prosecutor's inquiry reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes by mentioning as delivery the transport of goods by road, which the company issuing the invoices could not exercise, since its profile was the investment consultancy.
Moreover, it is also for defects of form, such as inadequate types of invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued to the order of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proved to be false.
Just as in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó's sports course, which both deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The forgers also did not pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., based in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have a meal at home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company denies having issued this invoice.
Deliberately established invoices
Another category of invoice issuers is that composed of those who were fully aware that they were asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esely Budapestert Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták group, has issued an invoice to the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért for a sum of HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, it cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently being wound up and which in 2003 issued invoices to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, Atlasz Egyesület Association and Vörösfenyő Egyesület Association, for an amount of approximately HUF 5 million, but behind which no services were actually provided.
No financial movement took place, either, as the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this was avoided by the organizations in their accounts.
The next category of invoice companies is that of companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative representative of the general manager of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where he could not be found, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of the company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Iván Kubatov also allegedly sent documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he took their value.
It was precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian masons created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies were functioning, as the accused explains by the fact that they did not receive work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-defendant as well as editor of the founding documents of the companies, he drew up invoices in their names, to the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations.
Kubatov gave a total of 15 invoices to organizations issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecution believed that 10% of the sums shown on the invoices as well as VAT went in Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictitious invoices which were used in the context of the grant application of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért Association applied to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA) of the Socialist Party for a grant.
They obtained this grant for twice HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search carried out in the office of Árpád Kemecsei, Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the accused will relate the method of making the invoices, as they had already done before the prosecution.
What might be really interesting would be that the main defendant, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or, possibly, the Socialists would have reached an agreement that in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the HUF 50 million, Zusi would carry the hat alone.
Today, he is probably offended, since requests for house arrest, based on a reduction in his conditions of detention, are continually falling into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and those who commit economic crimes that are not repairable, walk freely or at least, wait in their own homes for the end of the proceedings. He does not have that possibility.
The psychology of bidding: why is more money spent?
During auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the merchandise.
Neurology and economics researchers at the University of New York have been able to update the neurological and economic foundations of this known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced during this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
This research has attempted to draw up a neurological scheme of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group took part in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) process, researchers analyzed the active brain domains of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, one essential element of which is the over-auction of a third party, the whole under the brainstem, called striatum, moved intensively when the game was lost.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
This is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers continued financial surveillance analyses.
During these events, three groups overpriced against a partner, under various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they thus carried out their bet.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they would win the game, then they would receive an additional $15 as a reward.
While the third group received this $15 before the auction, the group members also lost this money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is that the emphasis was in one group on victory, while in the other, on failure.
By thus proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team of players "against failure" were prepared to bet higher than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade before the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by now leading to a third explanation." - Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at New York University, noted.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is mentioned as one of the leading causes of death.
It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people are infected with the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven thousand are receiving treatment. This is due to the fact that often the patients do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogens and diseases produced differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogenic genes, are mainly spread in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is recommended that they be vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no C vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating contaminated foods, usually accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
Then develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible jaundice, stools become lighter and urine becomes darker. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Every year around the world, one million people die of the most serious form of this disease, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that according to estimates, only one in ten patients is receiving medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know about the virus, because the pathogen destroys the liver cells in a sneaky way. In many cases, the first symptoms do not appear until after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion prior to 1991, drug users and tattooed people.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic type C hepatitis worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult with your treating physician as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does anyone who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a sort of analgesic, which had already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article according to which researchers at Oxford University made an interesting experiment by analyzing at what level belief in God could influence tolerance to human pain.
As part of this bizarre experiment, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also possible to discover that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments, in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experiment takes place in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and diffusing the electroshocks is attached to the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to watch two paintings in a sustained way, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with ermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experiment hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary evoked a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, concerned its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time received 20 electroshocks in four successive parts, while watching either the religious theme painting or the more general theme painting.
The Catholics said that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "in safety", as someone of whom we "take care of" and they "quieted, and peace invaded them".
In view of the painting of religious themes, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, thinks that one can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in atheists, provided that one finds the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image against which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, praised the results of this research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases actually changes our personality," added Wright.
After these excellent results, there is only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of subjects if one shows believers a Madonna painted by Leonard or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would seeing a better Virgin Mary result in better results?
You're what you disclose about yourself.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says that it can be found in the bottom of people's pockets in the same way as the sky above their heads. It knows where they spent their holidays, which specialists they consult and what are their interests.
It is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of society.
While as far as skeptics are concerned, establishing a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, they do not see the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary for Google founders to meet their original goal, which sounded like "Let's get all the world's information back into a system!".
According to the Google leader interviewed, after ten years of global upheaval work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
To the question: what will be there in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What is the job that would be best for me?" However, the software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, when they know enough about the users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer that initiates the search and the pages consulted by the interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they have been looking for, what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, a program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services to us based on our previous statements and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what my job is? Ask users, who are worried about Google's monopoly of information.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can cause fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly revolt against power that can cause Internet users to counter-reaction.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the terms sought are not only registered, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Human rights-conscious Internet users were able to sigh a sigh of relief last May, when Google, with the electronic legal protection agency EFF, proved its right in court against the FBI. According to the judgment rendered, in the future, Google will still not be forced by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information about the FBI's secret request of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, passed several years earlier. But in the end, it fails to obtain lists of searches of private users, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the past two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is castigated by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and private domain suffer from it when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against multinational companies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "savageons" bringing together passionate, activists and enthusiastic computer users who appear in many countries see Google as the next generation of big companies, the "connected body", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as an invader of the world because of Windows, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The document code and package of programs, continually refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, compared to the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet, and what web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, is just behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 does not concern anything other than collaboration, that the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the channels of communication made available to us, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other services, such as Twinter, or to last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, in which appear automatically their newest photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can see many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands the pictures of the morning, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company that dismissed one of his employees, just for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management, we can be sure of one thing: the term privacy is totally to be reconsidered nowadays.
He who lives an online life is made up of what he shows by himself, and this is how one can define the principle hiding behind the behaviour of today's young people.
One wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to bypass Google's monopoly, can do so (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using Google's search system, but at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them is not the least. Google’s online services, including text processing, image processing and reading of information, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge server parks and which do not assemble our best profile, which have existed to date.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising fields threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the services introduced at an increasing speed cause serious migraines not only to Microsoft, but to many other creators of computer programs.
In addition to all this, however, critical observers find contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the company's top management refused, in its entirety, the protests of the employees, after it doubled the price of the kindergarten and after the company considered the daily multiple restoration, taken at any time, to be too expensive. All this seems ridiculous in addition to the fact that already in 2006, Google acquiesced before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, the new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is sure is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that Google's scanning and archiving project of books and magazines is taking on such important dimensions that the company will soon find itself facing the Supreme Court of the United States, others tremble at its Health system, because in it, we can build a complete medical profit from our previous analysis results, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google is setting up a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian half-tones, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a frightening way just through Google data.
Two minors helped remove traces of Ózd's double homicide
"The police summoned two minors to question them in the case of Ózd's double homicide. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped to remove traces of the crime." - said the spokesman of the Borsod department police station.
The young people have acknowledged the facts they are accused of, so far they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraphic Agency) are young girls, defend themselves free.
Abetting murder can result in detention of up to five years.
The suspect of Ózd's double homicide, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and out of interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and for this reason he attracted his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as the little girl of this 9-year-old man.
According to information from the MTI, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his crimes hidden at the crime scene is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the takeover of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech kroner, for the purchase of 100% of the stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish have made despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wants to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer made so far for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the Stock Exchange in New York, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated to be between 5 and 10 billion Czech kroner by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The most important owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank, with about 25 per cent stakes, followed by the 14.7 per cent of the Ceská Sporitelna Bank and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their Tuesday comments on the international financial crisis, growing daily, the leading newspapers in the European press are already talking about a "second 11 September".
"The global financial catastrophe owes it to the American president" - accuses the daily newspaper of Rome, La Repubblica. "The president was not even able to make bloc with his own party behind a bill, improvised in a hurry, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as was mentioned by billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to speak of a second September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failings of the political leadership there that brought the global economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is increasing every day, and then the whole world will pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the Congress vote, a real danger threatens, that Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in a vacuum, just at a time when in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer - stresses the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva.
Some states may still extend a lifebuoy to their burgeoning financial organizations, and thanks to their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, we need the states of the European Union to pay little attention to their national selfishness, and to centralise control over divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than EUR 100 billion - recalled the Viennese daily Der Standard, who added that fears that European taxpayers too will have to put their hands in a very deep pocket, similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses the old continent from one side to the other.
The "sauveurs" should not immediately wave a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they noted in what case it would be rational to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
The intelligent automobile mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What method would be better to develop technologies that are able to avoid an obstacle, other than the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
Like, for example, the bees'.
In the amazing project presented at the CATEC, held in Japan, the buzzing bees gave the start strategic idea to Nissan engineers, to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacle sensors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired self-roboted system, of type BR23C, which it has equipped with qualities of bees, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own space, oval-shaped, which in reality, looks much like our secure protection shell - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the department of technological research and development and public relations of the brand.
The faceted eye of the bee plays a crucial role, since it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the faceted eye, the engineers approached the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, it evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which turns it into an avoidance manoeuvre immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it with a sufficient angle to avoid collision.
Unlike any existing system, this avoidance manoeuvre is entirely instinctive.
"If it wasn't for that, the mini auto robot wouldn't be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in the blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees possess to avoid other bees, in our case, we were only able to use the rotary motion, acceleration and slow down as manoeuvres at the disposal of the mini auto robot
The BR23C uses Lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a greater concentration of energy, making their lifetime longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not data processing, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism should deal with only a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on the data of previous manoeuvres. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
We don't need memory of gigabytes, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards the design of an instant avoidance technology. Nissan estimates that this system will enter mass-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
We even gave a name to the priceless baby.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, aimed at redeeming banks' dubious credit, and using it in multiple ways, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that during further debates extending until after midnight, Saturday, local time on the east coast, Congress leaders have agreed on the controversies that have existed for days and days, around the rescue plan for a total amount of $700 billion.
"We have taken a serious step forward" - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, according to which the only thing left is to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, commented on the outcome of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question here of saving Wall Street, but of turning the workings of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8 p.m., local time in Washington (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to local time in Central Europe), but did not cause a dramatic rise in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill responding to the name of the emergency economic stabilization law of 2008. Then, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress achieved tonight, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, spokesperson for the White House.
Moreover, the programme diverges from the original proposal made by the Bush administration, which it mentioned that the $700 billion had to be spent in one time, for the redemption of securities involving doubtful credits.
From now on, up to half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first $250 billion will be issued immediately after Congress passes the law, probably on Monday. This first amount will be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase bad debts from banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The program will be overseen by an independent organization, in which the Federal Reserve President will also take part.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress.
Under the Act, the Treasury Secretariat may implement a combined strategy: it may, at the same time, purchase bad debts, securities relating to bad mortgages and bad mortgages, as well as other types of “toxic” claims.
The appropriate persons in the department have stated that buybacks can take place not only at an auction but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance programme, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools at the root of the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to spend $700 billion for the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the large buyback of bad debts, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system causing the collapse of one or the other major financial institution.
"We will make the necessary arrangements, to be ready for the application of the law, as soon as it is signed" - he added.
On the other hand, the leaders of the banks who are in bad positions and waiting for state aid can expect their severance pay, simply referred to as the gold parachute across the Atlantic, to be capped by the government.
Wage cap is mentioned only in specific cases, and limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat provides assistance to the company.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys back through an auction, they will levy a surplus of tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly following the buyback of bad debts, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to leaders is not exaggerated.
For the image to be complete, it must be added that the existing golden parachutes are not changed. The cap only concerns new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force regarding the salaries of directors general - commented the chairman of the committee in charge of the financial benefits of the Chamber of Deputies, the Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the state acquires a right to acquire shares in the banks taking part in the plan. In this way, the risk of taxpayers decreases, since they can even win in the case as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks will fall back on their feet.
The bill mentions that in the next five years, the President must introduce a proposal to Congress that will rule on how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That's not why American citizens mandated us, it doesn't protect taxpayers' dollars - said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
His fellow Ohio Democrat, Mary Kaptur, believes that it is the same people who are pressing for action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Higher prices for plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly price increase in the chemical and chemical manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in the oil processing sectors (1.4 per cent), in the manufacture of electrical machinery and appliances (0.9 per cent), and in a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices for paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry saw an increase, ranging from 0.2 percent to 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which account for a significant share of domestic industrial production, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly because of the rise in gas prices introduced by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account domestic sales of processing sectors, oil processing prices were the most significant increase (32.4 per cent).
In the metallurgical manufacturing sector, prices rose by 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food production, beverages and tobacco, prices rose by 11 per cent.
There were price decreases in the textile and textile products production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, price increases ranged from 0.6 per cent to 9.1 per cent.
In the processing industry as a whole, prices have increased by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7 per cent higher than in the previous year.
Among the groups of domestic trade and according to sector allocation, in August, it was the sectors initiating profit-on-investment that showed the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and material-producing sectors for further processing did not change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the energy and material production sectors for further processing (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was 6.8 per cent, while in the profit-generating sectors, it was 1.4 per cent.
Export sales prices for the industrial sector, in HUF, increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 per cent over 12 months.
In a month, our national payment means have weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro, and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it has grown by 7.5 per cent against the euro and by 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that by 12 January the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will come into force, which is what the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "now everything depends only on when the electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic are put into service."
However, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to check in before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will present the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will hold an interview with the foreign political advisers of the presidential candidates, democrat Barack Obama and republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, along with John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, assured their support for the $700 billion government bailout plan. However, there are politicians who are demanding the resignation of the US Secretary of the Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, Congress representatives and the Administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they had reached agreements in principle on the plan to rescue the banks.
This financing plan, which aims to thaw the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more capable than the other, to drive the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has again managed to get a little ahead. McCain’s advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a parcelier just after the Republican convention, has faded.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the 700 billion bailout bill.
He pointed out that the proposal contained the consumer protection passages that he too supported.
"It is now necessary to act with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to describe McCain's economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We will all have trouble swallowing it (...) but doing nothing is not a possible way".
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal referred to the creation of a Treasury Control Commission and the cap on senior officials' severance benefits, and that he was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Secretary of the Treasury.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there is serious hope that the House will pass the bill on Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is what the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country evokes.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this recognized political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
The Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now these same modern citizens turn their backs on them.
This change of era is at the same time the problem of the whole of Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but Sunday came to a conclusion a process that was likely just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU rose to 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the elections of the Bundestag in 2005, that is to say at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization of the "devoring parents" established in the region in a consistent manner by the CSU.
Sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong about the pace. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of northern and eastern Germans in the developing Bavarian region could not be without consequences for the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks it has been the groups of classical citizens who have moved rather far away from the CSU, such as the self-employed, the artisans, the holders of the baccalaureate and the graduates of higher education.
In these groups, support for the CSU declined below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In his article entitled "Who ? With whom ? Party presidents stand on the reserve in the face of the questions of the coalition", the Austrian conservative daily deals with the confused domestic political situation that took place after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ wish to discuss with the Conservatives of the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations, and the Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during debates on public television, party leaders have barely let their cards glimpse.
Werner Faymann, President of SPÖ, confirmed that he wished to discuss the matter with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, remains open to Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the Reds.
As he has already said, collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is momentarily a very open question, which must be debated within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, President of the BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of the Reds and Blacks, we are ready to assume governmental responsibilities" - said Haider.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began as a representative of the current presidency of the European Union.
In his message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is a violation of the law that most affects Roma children and therefore one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of deputy Fidesz People's Party, Járóka warned that apart from the distinctions made during the hiring, Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, following their low qualifications.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have secondary school diplomas, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a tiny part of them have the possibility of obtaining a higher education diploma."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in the exercise of other fundamental rights.
Investment in the early education of Roma children means strengthening the economies of the member countries of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relationships in as wide a circle as possible, also between Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma child starts school, the more likely he or she is to become a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from income and consumption, he or she participates in the State budget.
"By virtue of their citizenship of the European Union, Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education, and be protected from low quality and sectarian education." - Lívia Járóka stressed.
According to the MEP, the European Union's cooperation towards an objective and action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools. To this end, compliance with the existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and the unemployed must be broken, and the opportunities provided by democracy must be given to Roma children so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe" - Járóka demanded.
On behalf of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities" for all, the objective of the Summit for Equal Opportunities in Europe, organised every year since the Berlin Summit last year, is to ensure a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and combat discrimination, targeted at European and Member State level.
CSU: Grace for a Period of Transition
The decision on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be taken in October.
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at Bavarian CSU summits has been adjourned.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still hold their place. The question is how long will the grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of voice, will be on the agenda of the exceptional party congress held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair, in any case, felt that they did not particularly care about their seats.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the furious members of the fraction and base, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, again under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the Christian-social union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "only sovereign" of Bavaria, accounting for 18 per cent of German GDP.
But conservatives still count heavily in this southern region, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced to join the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganisation of the party, the vice-president and the federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as Huber's possible successor, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates groping discussions with the liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Munich government.
A strange nose of fate has been that with the help of the list of Free Electors, enters into the legislation Gabriele Pauli, whose taking of measure against Stroiber has served as a possibility of putsch perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, and then unfailingly treat the very ambitious municipal political woman.
Now, CSU leaders are putting all their energy into stabilizing, one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far was pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also be given an active role. The former head of regional government and former president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some sharp remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be chancellor once again if they re-establish one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hiding his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not negatively influence the great Berlin coalition.
However, this is relative because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the socio-democrats is still going on.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results at 18.6 per cent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals : 110 - 0
No opposition MP joined the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is due to a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due to illegality in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-person legislature in this country of 10 million inhabitants has been very well opposed for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time in questionable elections, in the footsteps of the amendment of the constitution in 2006, would "allow" this time the presence of some opposition deputies in parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ has renounced its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, which is economically increasingly dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order described as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive an entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take credit because of the decrease in imports of Russian natural gas, which is increasingly expensive, and thus contributed to the passage of the company Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipelines crossing the country, passed into the hands of the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, during the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than failings, such as the ban on standing for one third of opposition candidates, referred to a prior appeasement.
However, the OSCE statement on Monday was already challenging the campaign, during which most opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present during the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political detainees have regained freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia. However, Russia with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper, considers the two independent territories for already a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has begun between Belarus and the EU" - said Alexander Milinkevich to our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains so, despite "the power was afraid in this parliament which has no weight, to bring in even one opponent".
The opposition does not foresee any protest actions in view of the results; rather, it tries to send its message on the need for economic reforms to voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we have to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, the local authorities are putting us on the road in terms of broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly", - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in Lukashenko's current regime, which considers social security as its main result, the most officially supported layer of pensioners no longer really considers it appropriate.
"Because of the country's debt and the rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time," says Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in acts." In this way, the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had not had rotating doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from now on, this new measure is in effect against the clever little ones, against whom points and then goes to drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-moaning novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors- says Brunetta- are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services," said the minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
"It's reformism," Brunetta says.
The installation in all the establishments of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of employees has been recorded, says the Secretary-General: "It is a process shared by employees, and we have had the cooperation of all."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 am is an excellent and healthy resolution".
At a conference at the Ecole Supérieure de l'Administration Publice
"In three months, the absences of public employees from sickness reduced by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand more workers in a year".
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics- explains the minister- over the last 8-10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and well in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined forces to challenge the standards of the Brunetta Decree using Codacón.
"While the Minister of the Public Service now spreads the data on the decrease of absenteeism in the workplace due to illness- writes the association of consumers- the people of the "active lazy" continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of employees of the correct and productive public administration, gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of infirmity on account of service is contested; the extension of the hours of residence of the sick worker, during which the inspection visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day, in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 persons who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, the Inail data confirm that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the leading causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To gain the attention of institutions, social forces and information resources on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all the Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Workers' Accident Victims, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data disseminated by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace", said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, during a message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Invalid Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "sincere appreciation for the continuous effort of associations in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and awareness of public opinion"
"naturally indignant, everyone has struck a fist to put an end to such tragedies which, because of their size, provoke the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, even though daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector, are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to undervalue the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed how "this phenomenon of the white dead constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and requires all institutions to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The accident data on work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent that the number of white deaths is still impressive" later stressed the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "downward trend" to translate into a minor attention, because it is precisely when attention relaxes, that tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be achieved through multiple actions."
"In our opinion- Mercandelli- more checks and inspections are needed, as is a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school."
- He added that "an effort must be made to communicate and raise public awareness.
"But above all, there must be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Mercandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for the victims of labour" and the "ascent of assistance towards which the system has been oriented in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to give back to the worker the guarantee of insurance – he added – so that the fate of the person who has an accident, should not depend on spontaneism or the enlargement of the legislator"
Mp3 reader pointed at the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players, can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission is announcing, which, in a press release in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unexpected and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"of this scientific report- we read in the note- it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music at full volume using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per day per week, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use mobile devices and mobile phones at full volume, can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to the scientific data- continues the manager Ue- this is a clear risk and we have to react quickly.
What is most important is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"The scientists-concluded the Ue executive confirm that there are good reasons for concern, and that the European Commission will now discuss with the Member States and other interested parties, what possible measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100Db, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that could arise from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit these data well using solutions such as reducing noise levels and exposure times.
The Scientific Committee points out that users of portable musical devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits on the maximum level of noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for extended periods of time are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to send the Commission away for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we end, in June we will pull the sum.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months' time, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will finalize the directives for Rome.
In March, when they have finished, the Committee and the Communal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so as to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
" "The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - wishes to emphasize Alemanno- it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome which can be used by political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Communal Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, she will have completed her tasks and then disappear, as this experiment must have a precise time-frame.
In June-announces the mayor- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale."
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replied: "It depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the management of everyday life and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to see forward, and further, towards a deeper perspective, seriously working for the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman city dwellers, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "it takes a draft strategic reference, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city, to improve itself, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit, ".
A future which, says the Mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but will look further" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but" also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president, that's why.
A famous American politician who wants to be independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as he always has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: "this person is full of ambition".
Obama is really stubborn: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these are attacks that do not say much; they are obviously attacks of a racial nature, and they do not answer the question of all the voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the womb of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will give his vote to.
Here emerges an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves put the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed to date, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 per cent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, the nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was kicked back home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's point of weakness.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
Usa, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for abolitions. And many accuse the Internet, this "murder" of newsprint.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they have not openly declared to the information attachés, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors are working on the assembly of newspapers, are a big problem.
According to the journalists interviewed, this problem must be solved if traditional journalism as understood by the general public is not to be reduced significantly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and newspaper journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is taking a wrong path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists don't have a hard time seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses are fending a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as "the murderer" of the newspaper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel is increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to technology hoping it "does something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest increase in American journalism is between who heads the newsrooms--that is, the directors--and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at local level this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is linked to the "safety of work".
Directors who think they will lose their jobs in the space of 3 years, are 47% at national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we're going at 30%.
That of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always receive high salaries, while the editor can earn 10 thousand dollars a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in total, spent a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "bad" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTE A GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the proceedings of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl climbing instruction.
At the time of his prosecution last week, he had been released from his home and turned into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked for the real estate agent to travel from the provincial town to a home in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the House of Representatives voting, contrary to the $700 billion bailout plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms to us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its quiet, moderate East Coast soul, favorable to federal institutions as well as to business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "the Washington ones" and the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and Southern States.
The soul, precisely, which was despotically felt with the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is just one example of the changes, of the great changes that the current economic earthquake pre-announces or is already letting go: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and can be not just here.
In both the United States and Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena that have arisen for some time, so much so that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the update, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category State-sovereign, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, obviously, have close relations with the foreigner, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families who live in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for whom it is governed: that is to say, to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only here national.
Political internationalisation really seems out of hand, or it has little to say: the obvious proof is provided to us by the European Union, which, as usual, shares between the various interests and between the various national strategies, does not manage to decide any common political lines.
And so, it is from the government of each state that all expect interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a affection of credits: when we are going through a difficult period, there are only the states that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements that no market or international organization can ever dispose of in a similar way.
This new emphasis on the nation-state crisis is in perfect harmony with the ever-major importance that the more recent economic developments tend to attribute to a factor quite related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, indeed, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized at one stroke, that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with things rather unmaterial such as water, crops, oil.
Things which can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a confined space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly possesses more maps than he who is not, that is, he who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, foresees a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for someone who can take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shade.
And moreover, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: discredit, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number of Western countries.
Thus further increases the conviction of the various classes, before actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more alien to the opinions of majorities.
In short, The demand for leadership, feeds underground, a powerful and ramified movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the "revolts" of the improvised elections or, in the collective changes of the latter most recently, from the conservative rise in Austria Bavaria, the fall of the Labourers in Great Britain, the rebellion of the American Congressists against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not happen by chance).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, would say someone, have ever more difficulty, which is not of today's date, to understand and thus to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and potentially stirs up in a disproportionate way.
In view of all this, talking about a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda, seems frankly exaggerated.
But it is said that keeping eyes wide open is not without reason.
The superglue to walk on the walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers managed to keep a 100 kg body glued to a vertical wall.
ETUDE- The American journal Science has published the discoveries of some researchers from Dayton University, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nano tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a stack of spaghetti." Explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the geckos, covered in microscopic hairs that ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time that it "is easily detached from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at Dayton University.
MARKETING ON MURSE? –” this material could be used as a temporary adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers are thinking of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nano tubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could include aerospace engineering.
For now, no superhero.
OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, Californian researchers presented an adhesive made of microfibers such as hair, which self-cleans dust during movement on an area to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medications: never with fruit juices.
Attention to grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in the summer because they are de-altering and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital medicines, alter the absorption amplifying or decreasing, depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether canned or fresh, associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, cancelling their beneficial effects and putting patients at risk for their health.
Grapefruit juice has already been strongly criticized as being responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-statinal and neurological drugs up to toxic levels.
MEDICINAL PRODUCTS IN RISK- It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which gave the news in a two-year newsletter, alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger deriving from this mix and to pay attention to what one drinks, if one takes medicines such as, for example, Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT THAT PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the Public University of Milan: "these discoveries are generally reported immediately to the various national and international drug agencies that will have to change the informative notes of the medicines if necessary.
It is always appropriate to read the illustrative papers of the medicines you are taking, and if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," stressed the expert to the Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to Paul Krugman of the United States for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote in an article on the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A forecast that unleashed many controversies, and which was criticized to the economist for years, but which has now proved accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, disappeared from the attention of the public," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is not only a "high value economist" but also a highly aggressive "disclosure" and particularly critical of the Bush administration's excesses of liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the broadcast of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open-source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach always and even more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work, carried out by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package shows itself to the general public with various new features: from the welcome screen, and the interface reviewed and become less austere, to other more important ones, such as the compatibility born for the operating system Apple Mac OS X, and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest standard ISO version.
Open Office paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some features specific to some modules, such as the one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphical development module, retaining the original aspect of the page.
Still on this front, it is possible to create "Hybrid PDF" documents that unite the typical Adobe chart with the elements of a spreadsheet or text maker.
The collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, because to each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for a better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they are expected to issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version which was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual also available for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, the installation cd can be shipped to the home or workplace.
And while the theme of free can be a means to disseminate it in the houses, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office the suite tries the great challenge, already able to rely on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities which offer a service of training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could moreover open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the equivalent writing video of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the rival PowerPoint presentations;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows to work on the databases; finally Drwa is the graphics module.
Target for 2008, arriving at 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure.
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
It is the website of the daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
At the age of 26, Kohl was the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the third generation Epo, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
Blood tests carried out on Kohl test pieces are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If counter-analysis confirms positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, thus taking the polka dot jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES wonders if ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of migrants has recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed reluctantly.
Would this transform the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is interested in, which dedicated a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are both those where "more integration and more work" are recorded, but also "an anti-immigrant feeling the strongest in the country and the most important support for the Northern Lega"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also referred to episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature wanted by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as proof of the climate change in Italy.
Tendency underlined by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI in the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Student victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for one room.
The student rental market does not experience a crisis
According to Sunia's latest survey, the tenant union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding whole categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin must support- explains the head of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the high demand from students has so distorted the market that a process of generalized increase has even begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, without rent limits, sub-leases.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of taxation are necessary to calm prices.
Reading in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, it ranges from 650 euros minimum (Zone Bande Nere), to an average value of 800 (Zone Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Zone Vittoria)
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and from 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are required for a single, 450 euros for a double bed.
Slightly lower values (€550 for a single) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can only save money if you move away in the peripheral areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a single in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one, you spend 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the zones Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, you have to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by extra-community students, there is a further anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, cities elect historic halls.
Historical cinemas close in favour of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centres, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of the marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of the large multi-salles, and the death of the consumption of mono-salles in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seems inevitable and indisputable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historic places and charged with memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a bit of path and so many emotions", observes the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, film that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, and which told the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia of a way of living cinema, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of traders, mean everything: over the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and it is the halls of the main cities that have paid mainly the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the areas most affected by the closure, Romaine Emilia leads with 82 single cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The proof which confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is indeed the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-salle cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy over the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room closes in a city, these frequentors are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the missed deliberation of the credit in favour of traders: the state's previous debt is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government is not complying with existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, worried about these closures, decided to resolve the situation thanks to the signing of a protocol between Town Hall and Anec, the first of this kind in Italy, to defend and promote the cinemas single rooms of the historic centers and on the periphery.
Among the normative measures planned are tax facilities for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted area, and will have special parking rates and some parking lots.
"It is an initiative that I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna implementing other measures.
It is clear, however, that to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" that I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so much shared emotion, I turn on the other side so as not to see the signs blackened by dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta’, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the town council's choices to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
heavy accusations are made by the magistrates of the Direction antimafia de la Calabria, against the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for Mafia association.
The levers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous with the boss, already convicted of association of mafia-type criminals, as well as paying 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay for consultations with Master Piromalli.
"So it would have been granted to the clan - write the judges - to officially enter the town halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and orientation of the public administration"
The president of the Calabrian regional committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide only "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest."
This morning's arrests followed those of July, after which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
By the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still because of the alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Mayor of the UDC at the time of dissolution, had been appointed head of a centre-right coalition, after the run-off in May 2006.
He cried out for scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the vice minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of having planned it all for a political question, but in view of the request for imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in asking for the variation of the draft of the A3.
Starting from the intercepts ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm wrote, is emerged "the readiness to marry the demands of a businessman, representative of a better known group, close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy comes from the waves, now the big ones throw themselves.
This is an disproportionate deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface area and now the world's major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colossals like Chevron have laid their eyes, and now try to get their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil lowered, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give a big boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by sea swell operating systems.
This amount would be twice that of nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides..
Colossians in attack.
The first company to invest in marine energy was the Energis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a real revolutionary step.
Two years ago, more and more candidates among these companies dedicated to traditional energy have always relied on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying technologies on ocean energy- said the spokesperson for a company associated with the American oil colossus, the economic daily Wall Street Journal- and she is evaluating the possibilities of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a permit deliberated by the American Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that precisely in Alaska, the Usa continue to extract oil, and recently President Bush set up a project for further excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which travel the route of energy coming from the sea, and the money invested so far, although their details are not known, according to observers, an increasing interest.
Tecnology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology still in its beginnings, because marine energy does not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a higher environmental impact.
" And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The wave thrust, which moves the mud up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine that, in turn, supplies a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through underwater cables.
At present, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a shopping center and parking lot using six underwater turbines from the East River of New York.
The movement of the water during the tides, turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant has announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permissions to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electrical Energy, deserves at this moment, the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, are looking to the coast, have invested $7 and a half million in 2008 and are planning investments up to $35 million in 2009.
