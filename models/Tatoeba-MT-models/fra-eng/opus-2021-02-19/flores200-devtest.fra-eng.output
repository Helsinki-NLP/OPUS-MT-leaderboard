This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown brown on the top and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
This discovery also helps to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Given that dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, which is called rachis, but nevertheless show other characteristics peculiar to feathers – beards and beards – researchers have deduced that rachis was probably an evolutionary development subsequent to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they are not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, even if the tail of a young dinosaur is involved, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
Scientists indicate that it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young one.

The work performed was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts traction on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a sort of halo, and consists of a large number of small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally an experiment of low technicality: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put in an envelope a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the officers have verified his identity, the elector throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs his or her voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations fairly strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision, according to specific procedures.

She first participated in the slalom, where she obtained a "did not finish" (DNF) in her first race. 36 of 116 competitors scored the same result in this race.
His other race, the giant slalom, allowed him to finish in tenth place in the women's group sitting with a combined time of 4:41.30, i.e. 2:11.60 minutes less than Austrian Claudia Loesch, who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes less than Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
In the women's sit-ski category, four skiers failed to finish their race; in the giant slalom, 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in this race failed to rank.
Madhya Pradesh police found the laptop and mobile phone stolen.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We arrested five people for raping the Swiss national, and we recovered her cell phone and laptop."
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhatha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, Commissioner of Police, stated that the accused had their faces hidden when they appeared before the court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit her, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The track where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked to allow the rescue services to remove the driver from the Red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court Court of Edinburgh.
She is in custody pending her trial and trial, but the eyewitness accounts could be compromised because her portrait has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish pictures, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, has told reporters that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will focus on the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of existing borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics discussed included the future state of Jerusalem, which was sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only consents for a period of five years.
Shooters of the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Park Conservation and Heritage Officer at NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first slaughter campaign were properly trained and trained in safety instructions.
Martelly inducted yesterday a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
It is the fifth CEC of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a series of measures to engage the country on the road to new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to the vast protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were scheduled to take place in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it had been aware of 27 accidents related to these aircraft.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "non-serious."
The department responded by describing Apple's postponement of the report as "very regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariannes at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office stated that no damage had been reported in that country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre stated that there were no signs of tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage by diverting their buses to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the death of at least six of them has so far been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he worked in the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature deliveries during his spare time.
His research has shown that if a hormone was given, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua Agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... even more... I love her and I'm going to miss her... I hope she's resting in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal election revealed that the number of opponents of Australia's transformation into a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those interviewed share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist had to swim at the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, which was banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and computer professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest number known to date.
Several people checked the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and more specifically how the Earth formed, as comets collide with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor at the beginning of this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described rumours as "talking and political nonsense."
He is expected to run for President in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly for shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technologies, not on previously used ground radar systems, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transport is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and relay parks are not available on the ground.
Fear of lack of transport has created the possibility that the game can be played behind closed doors, without the fans of the teams.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden indicated that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process was estimated to be much longer, following reproduction between an endemic Darwin pinson, Geospiza fortis, and the conical-billed immigrant pinson, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces
It can be pulled in fine wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or laminated in leaves.
It can be done very fine, and glued to another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand painted images in books called "enluminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or the basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (since the hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean, moist hands, squeeze them into a ball.
Moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and produce some kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush in almost all houses, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems were found in the houses of the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public baths where men and women met.
When you call a person thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The biggest advantage it has brought us is to have made transport much simpler and faster.
This brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them are medium-sized felines that eat equally medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including pets at large) that eat small prey, much more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
Packs consist of one to three related adult males, as well as about 30 females and young lions.
Women are generally very close to each other, their families being made up of a large number of sisters and girls.
Lion troops act as packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly for their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficult), swim, jump long distances and tow with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (gender Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones able to roar.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the broad roar of the lion, but rather a phrase whose words would be shouting and roaring.
The ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
According to scientists, the ocelots hunt and find the animals to eat (proy) by smell, sniffing their way on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and also move very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by melting in their environment before throwing themselves at them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily go back), it often finds itself in an environment different from that in which it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it previously needed.
The population of origin has not changed at all, it always needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce their food using the sun by photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We make our homes and our plant-based clothing. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosaic was the superpredator of the time, he feared nothing except the other mosaics.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth like razor blades, as well as an additional set of teeth in the palate, so that everything that crossed its path could not escape.
We are not sure, but he may have had the forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosaics, and he may even have been cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was no size against him.
Although the Romans consumed the food we know, they ate some strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and the loir, a sort of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets together where they rested on their side while they were eating.
Roman meals of antiquity could not include those foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced into Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered the God’s home.
People made sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could access.
Some pyramidal towers, the ziggurates, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was in the open air.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were only open counters overlooking the street. The houses were built of stones.
Since there were no large forests in Canaan's land, wood was extremely expensive.
In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder that he found Greenland — and named it that way — traveling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Although each country is "n Scandinavia", there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words “Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776” were read. The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (which measures about 29 inches three quarters by 24 inches) was stored rolled.
It is therefore likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landing and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French of Vichy, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting it.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Forces de la France Libre had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means civilian and which is related to the Latin words "civis", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means large city or city-state and which also indicates, in a way, the size of the society to which it relates.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — Congress being its only component — under the articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the State authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from tax laws or tariff laws between States.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all States before they could be amended and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German national team, the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of its group of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing through it mentioned it under the name of Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it Qing Empire province in 1885.
In 1895, after his defeat in the first Sino-Japanese war (1894–95), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it handed over Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
The Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the temple of the sun and the hall of the three windows.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been reconstructed to provide tourists with a better insight into their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the analog film era.
It's still made today, but what's important is that its image format is inherited from the photo sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, and it's quite disconcerting, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
It is therefore said that the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. family of APS formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The third-party rule, which is highly abused and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that stimulates dynamism while offering protection to the image.
It indicates that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was called into question.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked European states to each other despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than 1000 years and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder whether this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain put in place a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade has violated international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters in order to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime areas, thus representing a threat even to neutral ships.
Since this tactic only triggered a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its limitless underwater war.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a tendency for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations wanted to prevent such a situation from reoccurring in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept employment with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred in his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his director in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different epochs; every stage of China or every family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known of these periods is the era of the Three Kingdoms that took place for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the most bloody times in Chinese history. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of XI'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, the trades were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same is true for the army, because the classification of armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution has also inspired many other repressed working classes in other countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the framework of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous under the name "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is totally isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy at all to find, even if you know it exists. When you entered the cave, you are completely isolated.
Above, you can see nothing but the bright and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, you can see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many giant structures erected in honour of the dead pharaohs.
The plateau of Giza, or "Giza necropolis", in the valley of the Dead in Egypt, comprises several pyramids (the great pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Kheops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The push symbol looks like a V and the pull symbol looks like a staple or square with a missing lower side.
The top means you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you have to start with the rise (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow up usually produces a softer sound, while a bow down is stronger and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to write your own marks in pencil, but do not forget that the printed bow marks are for a musical motif, and therefore it is generally necessary to respect them.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of saleswomen.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and the queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrorized queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the superprofits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental advantages of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of order.
These events took place in the period generally considered as the Upper Middle Ages – period of history in Europe during the 11th to 13th centuries (1000-1300).
The Central Middle Ages was preceded by the Upper Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological thrust or technological imperative to a strict sense that humanity's destiny is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place in a process far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on intrinsically conditioned rather than socially conditioned societies.
For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive car ownership also leads to a greater incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new health care techniques to treat injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture related to that geography would have appeared, which, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to the laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered to be the capital of feudal Europe.
His reputation as an epicentre of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders came back with gifts such as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th–10th century and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow pace of communication, Western modes could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the crusades, was the use of buttons to close clothes.
Subsistence farming is an agriculture used to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system, using preserved seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas that allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and/or gender of members.
Criteria that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often report their belonging by means of distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or wilful abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered to be "ferocious" or savage. Some wild children have been confined by persons (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by the parents of a serious intellectual or physical disability of which the child was suffering.
Wild children may have been severely abused or traumatized before being abandoned or fled.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When fully raised by non-human species, wild children display behaviours (within the limits of their physical dispositions) that are almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who discover new teaching such as the use of a new program or the start of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little man trombone from Microsoft Office is also one.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to interrogate, guide and explain procedures that could have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but that is the case.
We see the foster care system as a safe area for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach of usages and gratuities.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are seen as major factors in promoting the use of the Internet (James et al. 1995).
"Personal Involvement" and "Continuing Relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, that is, facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect whether a person lies by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand the speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that such human behavior interpretation abilities may be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research of the twentieth century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the reserve of the variations expressed.
Segregation and recombination alternate the variations between the two basins at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ovens, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all vital amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" a little in the same way as the chimpanzees of the savannah do today.
Interruption of sleep is the process of intentional awakening during your sleep period and sleepiness shortly afterwards (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively silent awakening, in order to make you regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself reset the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking a lot of fluids before falling asleep (including water or tea, known to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present vital force. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and many Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the way of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (light energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras activated, and the awakening consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the understanding between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see real clashes, through alternative armies, on battlefields in Africa as well as in Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, be they bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for freight transport is by far the most effective means of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
Marines' work has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and assets, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and assets.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War, where the Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly using U-Boots, was trying to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on the hills or other pasture areas, often cared for by chevriers who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the more known term shepherds. These pastoral methods always run today.
The "carways" were built in England from the 16th century.
Although the tracks for cars were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses who pulled them to reach higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
The cruisings were introduced early enough to keep the runways in place. However, it was gradually realized that the runways would be more effective if they had an iron band on top.
This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the cars.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk standing two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ("right man").
Their predecessors, the Australopitheques, did not walk as usual.
Biped specialisations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, this is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and turn them off.
It is clear that the world has changed a great deal as a result of the scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that the problems have become more serious because of the overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten project signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few streets there, to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the court of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, which had his troops read it in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap leaves that are still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs have survived and are still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them dinosaurs being given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have paws covered with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic drugs or domestic chemicals.
Consult the label for the first-aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are very adapted to parasitize humans.
They, like bedbugs, are nestling, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may well feel that it is not in their or the child's interest to take care of a baby's upbringing.
These couples can choose to make an adoption project for their baby.
In the context of adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which guides most scientific research.
However, this is not the only experiment, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to mark either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially the fauna and flora.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
One can, for example, visit, photograph and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns by car to get to their workplace and meet other people who will work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a passenger car-based transport system.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from its state of stability, which has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear as many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
The traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate manner.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
The insects were the first animals to fly away, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape their enemies and find food and companions more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragon flies and ephemerals.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
No less than 20% of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed by their size and technical excellence in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the daily language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, peoples have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in raw form and are quite simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consisted of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
Rather, they were the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also expressed the theory that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new methods of writing has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to rarer uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil cutter.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty arrives.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like climbing a hill to a heavy cart, dividing the core again, then releasing a little of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible face and 100 km on the hidden face.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to go up to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding out what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what in their environment drives them to do or not to do certain things.
Two popular theory of content are the theory of the hierarchy of Maslow's needs and the theory of the two Herzberg factors.
In general, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the leader of former colleagues. From one end of the spectrum being trying to remain "the good friend" (or the good girlfriend).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she has to change everything that the group has created so far and do things in his/her own way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This often leads to dissension between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as contact points for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member is accountable and sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to impose itself on the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the substantive services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's need.
Before an organisation is innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus reducing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, injury, tumours and brain trauma affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often highly connotated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The aim of artificial intelligence research is automation by task machines requiring an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to clients' diagnoses and questions, and the recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focusing on the provision of solutions to the problems of daily life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the army, as it has been installed in several home computer and video game software.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can watch the ancient objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a superb work of art while sitting with their class.
Practically participating in an excursion is also a great way to think about a trip and share experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design an annual website dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the older versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often try the blog experience with a neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes the situation.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog is beginning to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "obligates students to learn more about the world around them." The need to attract public interest encourages students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"When well used, blogs can help students to strengthen their analytical skills and critical thinking: by actively reacting to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and present their own views on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a large number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south you will find Niagara Falls and to the north, the Muskoka area and its surroundings, which have a pristine natural beauty.
All of these measures, and many others, make Ontario what foreigners see as Canada's quintessence.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent by itself, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known to be luxury seaside resorts.
Arabs have also brought the practice of Islam to the land and this religion has spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Town road that connects Europe with India.
In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a wedding ring (which should not seem too precious.
Women must realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviours that they consider to be harassment, because it is common for them to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in the rejection of men's advances, and don't be afraid to stand firm (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sinners in the 10th century B.C.E., and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after destroying it had rebuilt it and baptized Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading counters there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to shop.
In the vicinity of the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, narghiles and bevellings of all kinds, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the extreme east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma must be investigated to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for treks tracking mountain gorillas among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motor taxi) to move around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a small race.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Tombuktu" has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" show on the PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the cities of the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km2, divided into 14 ecozones, each with a specific wildlife.
It is one of the most famous amusement parks in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It may be advantageous to get a Wild Card that provides access to some South African parks, as well as to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main focus for many tourists.
The row of buildings drawing the horizon of Hong Kong has been compared to a glistening bar graph, which reveals itself by reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and join the Kowloon seafront opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the north shore.
This is the place that British settlers have invested. So, it seems to me a good starting point, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called the Sundarban National Park.
The forests, however, are not composed solely of mangrove marshes: they also contain some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered with water/marcage areas.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, where you can find about 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the Interdistrict Bus Station (located on the other side) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often complete, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coasters, which are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a cableway bridge over the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two tracks of 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in subsistence farming.
Other indigenous tribes that inhabited the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, survived mainly through fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once known as "the giant province of India", was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous populations.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo courts of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and games are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, check out Polo's Argentina Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the pound of the Falkland Islands (FKP) whose value is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only island bank in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
Pound sterling is a widely accepted currency throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the neighbouring islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if British and American currencies may be. Talk about it in advance with the owners in order to agree on a method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands money outside the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo is located in southern Ecuador, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone and summer temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than the thermometer says.
There are not really any "weather" and "dry" seasons: precipitation is roughly constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are wildlife; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to park authorities, at least 100 metres from bears and wolves and 25 metres from all other wildlife!
As docile as they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bear and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid transporting or cooking smelly food and keep camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval impasse in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful gathering in the city during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, because Auckland is riding on two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore Beaches (in the North Harbour District) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and allow safe swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburb of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very frequented by families, have many shops along the coast. Bathing is safe there.
The main local beer is the "Number One", a beer quite ordinary, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the "Manta".
There are plenty of French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink local tap water safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "cream coffee" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many reef trips are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay special attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, box jellyfish arrive near beaches and river estuaries, and can sometimes be seen outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would deviate from them.
The saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is in the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
The advance reservation gives the traveller the peace of mind to know that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even packages that combine flight and accommodation.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or get other documents necessary for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider this to be an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed camping area.
Don't forget that even if the musical shows are finished on the main stages, other musical shows can continue until late at night on other festival sites.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, make sure to check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noise at the most exposed cabins.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are rarely found, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of dishes, drinks and entertainment in order to maintain the good mood of the guests and keep them there.
On some sites, locals offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. Nevertheless, drunkenness alters judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone travelling by car to high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, it can fall in very little time enough snow to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or powdery weather or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted all year round.
The safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most striking moment for many visitors.
In common language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion to African land, and in particular to the savannah, with the aim of attending the sight of wild animals in their environment.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and standard equipment allows them to be observed.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also referred to as a bush walk, walking safari or footing) consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Olympic Summer Games, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the delay was announced, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March most cancellation policies based on coronaviruses do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing about 7,000 yen.
By ironing wet clothes, you can make them dry more easily. Many hotels have iron and ironing board that can be loaned, even if there are none in the rooms.
If you don't have an iron or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you find one.
Avoid not letting the fabric overheat (which can cause its shrinkage or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some localities, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute; in others, it is necessary to boil water for several minutes.
The efficiency of the filters varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter harmful animals that they do not know in their area of origin.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that may injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some locations, duty-free shops provide an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from excise taxes and duties.
Travellers to countries with high taxes can sometimes make considerable savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your mind open: steep slopes, narrow lanes and tight curves predominate.
The speed limitations shown are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict compliance is even greater than before.
On the other hand, mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are rather good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common: apples are cooked and baked throughout the year, while cherries and plums point the tip of their nose in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often blend particularly well with a tight cup of coffee.
If you want small but copious pastries, try the Berlin balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made of herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be "solid" or "liquid", depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Since Indonesia has 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualifier, it tends to refer to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of dishes that are simply seasoned, the predominant flavors Javanese prefer being peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety problem: indeed, the user's feet can remain stuck there.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth and fairly narrow heel and sole.
Then, some saddles, especially the English, have safety bars that allow a litter to fall from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the South American Yosemite, with many large walls and different granite cliffs.
From the top of the mountain, the panoramas on the mountains are breathtaking. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly discovering new paths that can be used on the slopes, where the possibilities are unlimited.
Downhill winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down a snow-covered track with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many aficionados, sometimes called "ski bums", who organize their entire holidays according to skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings showing skiers date for some 5,000 years BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century; the first leisure ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski hiking: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or ski touring.
This is similar to alpine-type ski touring, as well as mountaineering, but does not generally incorporate these activities, which are practiced on rugged terrain and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to travel distances a little longer than on foot – but you will only very rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. In classic circumstances, travelling across several countries therefore involves having to apply for several visas and undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions a little like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through passport checkpoints.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each of the member countries of the space, thus saving time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition to determine whether a manufactured object is an antique. Some tax agencies define property over 100 years old as antiques.
The criteria vary depending on where you are; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than that in Europe.
Artisan products can be considered antiques, even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Reindeer farming is an important means of livelihood for the Sami and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer farming, they lived in fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer primarily as line animals.
Nowadays, many Sami practice modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romans, the term “Gitan” is often considered pejorative because of its association with negative stereotypes and a distorted image of the Roma people.
If the country you are travelling to is the subject of a travel warning issued by your government, your health insurance abroad or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also use the advice of other governments than yours, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East might face situations different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
The opinions are only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and too simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that could cause damage, serious social upheaval or loss of life.
Very adverse weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of several kinds, depending on geographical, topographical and atmospheric characteristics.
Violent winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea spouts, and cyclones.
Extreme weather events, regional and seasonal, include cold storms, snow storms with severe winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to learn about the risks of bad weather that may affect their destination area, knowing that this may affect the routes they are planning.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
An Internet search of "Hospital Environment Course" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
Training normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wildlife survival are common, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning a foreign sex change operation must ensure that they have in their possession documents valid for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports whose sex is not indicated (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and sex varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is equally variable.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Transsexual persons in the pre-operative phase should not expect to pass the scanners while preserving their privacy and dignity.
The ripping currents are the currents that return from waves that break on the beach, often on a pitfall or equivalent.
Due to underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a rapid flow to deep waters can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from an attempt to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, returning to swimming is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you will not be caught again. It is also possible, that depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted or not, you may want to wait for help.
The reintegration shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travellers who have had difficulty adapting to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to adapt to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your original culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers to a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travellers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, you always hear the noise of tourists and sellers. The history of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: the island of Livingston and the Deception, where the caldera flooded with a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southern part of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula melt into the plateau, then reappear to form the 360-km-long Ellsworth Mountain Range crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinelle chain, comprises the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson massif, which peaks at 4892 m.
In remote locations, without a cellular telephone network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone does not usually replace a mobile phone, because you need to be outside and have an unobstructed view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure craft, as well as by shipments that have remote data transmission and telephony needs.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about the connection to this service.
Those planning a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them choose this possibility.
This formula is particularly appreciated by young people who leave school, as it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.
Often, having taken sabbatical year courses abroad can actually give you a better chance of higher education in your country.
As a general rule, tuition fees are required to attend these educational programs.
Finland is a destination of choice for recreational boating. The "Land of the Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Recreational boating is a national hobby in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises are characterized by an extended stay in St Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore with cruise trips, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, in Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the seaside and no tour of this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
We must not be ashamed of it: it is not different from the personal fears and fears that many people feel about other things.
For some, understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not having control.
Transport companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often, as part of an urgent repair, the issue of delays is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts related to them.
On some roads, large companies have their own aircraft, but on other roads and for small businesses, there has been a problem.
Had they sent goods by air cargo, on certain routes it would have taken days to pass the unloading and customs.
The only way to send it more quickly was to send it as checked baggage. Air regulations will not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that is where you intervene.
The most obvious way to travel first class or business class is to pay a large amount of money for this privilege (or, better yet, ask your business to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for the business class, and eleven times for the first class!
Generally speaking, there is no need to seek reductions for business-class or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of travellers who are willing to pay very high prices for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their tariffs in an informed manner.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but recognized by no United Nations member country.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is Turkey's third largest city, the second port after Istanbul, and an excellent connecting platform.
What was the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern shopping center, developed and living, set around a huge bay, surrounded by mountains.
The large boulevards, glazed buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional roofs in red tiles, from the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.

When you go north, be sure to visit the magnificent shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (temple), a place known worldwide for the apparitions of Mary.
Remember that you visit essentially a mass grave, as well as a site that has an almost incalculable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who survived their stay here, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labour, Jewish or non-Jewish alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not disfigure the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, because the law establishes that this is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the subway are made only in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have the reputation of being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave at best, to act like someone very high. This will greatly facilitate your travel.
The abrupt exteriors of Parisians evaporate quickly if you show a minimum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly beech, spruce and fir, with a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a wide variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils and altitude levels.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal species and birds.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and large grouse can be seen there, as well as many other common species.
When visiting a monastery, women must wear skirts covering their knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide stoles to women who arrive without anything, but if you bring yours, and in addition it bears bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Just as men must wear trousers covering their knees.
We can also borrow this garment from stock at the entrance, but since it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. A unique size for men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and all available condiments, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, followed by the word Sie which means you, always start with a capital, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an excellent way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch are c and g, since their pronunciation varies according to the next vowel.

Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their time was not as worrying as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge infrastructure located in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favourable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first feasts of cherry blossoms were organized by the emperor only for himself and the other members of the nearby aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants have their best appearance when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "one".
If you visit a strictly landscaped garden, the collection of "samples" will also cause you to be expelled without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to move around, and where you can buy almost everything you need once you get there.
But, located in the "high tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to adapt to the heat (always) and to a strong sunlight (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also some buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you are planning to take is going to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kyriat Arba.

Many traditions related to these festivals have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
It is traditional to spend the night of Easter awake at a place to see the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches often organize a Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with congregations often breaking into the feast at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived on these islands originally did so by water, swimming, floating objects, or by air.
Because of the great distance that separates them from the continent, mammals could not reach the end of the voyage, making the giant turtle the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can discover the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to admire the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark almost all day long.
As the regions are sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than the one to which Westerners can be accustomed.
Costumes are classic workwear, and employees are called by their family name or function.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial because it focuses on collective effort rather than commending individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain the consent of their superiors for any decision they make and are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without asking questions.
