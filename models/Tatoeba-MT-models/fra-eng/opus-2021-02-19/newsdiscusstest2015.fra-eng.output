The remaining UKIPs who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK for health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the undesirables.
First you use specious arguments, then discredit them by a barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to queue behind chronic hypocondria intolerants who think it's all due to them.
I think you're the one using specious arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing nutcrackers, hardly exists.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP's measures against health tourism, so there's no problem.
Only in the parallel universe of UKIP can Carswell appear as a revolutionary.
A quotation from a dishcloth does not constitute evidence.
Yeah, so shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a specious argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity either, so you should be careful when trying to kill the debate with homophobia accusations.
Farage's sentence was very surprised, but only because we talk so rarely about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remark.
You're gonna have to manage to get over it.
I'm not sure where you're going with this, but I guess you don't like it when the media talk about what you don't like.
We talk about it so rarely because unlike Farage and his crazy followers of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of god and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then no.
Finally, the situation is as rotten in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis that comes the austerity period will not have fixed anything.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland's ''EUROPE TIGRE'' was praised a few years ago.
We knew the rest!
That's a recommencement to read the article.
There is an attempt to make Ireland believe that it is a virtuous country and that a ''NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE'' is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on Europe's lowest societies, a very flexible labour market, a continuing emigration.
With these ingredients there is nothing to ''pavoise'' for the moment with the coming of Poles.
In the 1980s of the 20th century, irlance was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with the portugal In considering a constant perimetre, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
The Greek was in front.
That their development was not a long quiet river, it is on in view of the recent events.
Lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on businesses.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on taxes actually paid by the multinationals.
According to a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in general in France.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic is back to the heights, and there are new (and expensive) cars all over the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily traffic jams since the beginning of the school year.
Is that supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon ignite.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a clash on the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr O'Leary will soon be buying a whole new fleet of aircraft, so some bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two once we're done.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair charge passengers a surcharge for the additional fear that we were willing to provide them with?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can take it to heart.
Any article about Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair against those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the basic rate just have to go after themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be happy with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether the passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that this was an error of the airport air traffic controllers.
The passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your compensation dreams.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not as you say.
Have a nice trip.
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is mostly pedestrian, and literally teems with people.
People do not come in large numbers for the quality of restaurants (most of them conques) or for the Salon de la revue à l'Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With many foreigners who spend .....
Do you think Sunday's opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sundays, full of people with 50% tourists.
@aloes False!
The only argument that would seem acceptable to me is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they are buying tax-free.
Tourism areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons .
The industry remains where expensive equipment, operated on Sundays, allows to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right enjoyed by employees, with exceptions.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the minister responsible for the economy nor, moreover, the minister responsible for foreign affairs, have the slightest competence to reform the Labour Code.
When they lock her up.
What's the point of the law?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies that wish to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday apm I take my grandchildren to the municipal library.
In my town of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
That's access to culture...
This is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life that he tenaciously defended against fascism
the way of life that he tenaciously defended against fascism and Bolshevism
What if her daughter's estate was, against her will, to use to pay the estate fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some aren't terrible.
Probably his estate would like his share of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Neither do I.
But for five years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 He stood up to the other aristos of the government who wanted to discuss a "agreement" with the Nazis and he very skilfully won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium, and ultimately the whole world, can thank God for having had during these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the helm and no other.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to raise the money from the inheritance fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when it was "the moment of truth," Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market through public works will favour only large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, since infrastructure projects are by definition not renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the minister, they reflect the real French evil: distrust of dialogue
Back to princeps values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest of us not be in need!
Either solidarily we come to his help, or he has RIGHT in exchange for the services he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to the Smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the landlord who lives on income from his properties.
It is necessary to differentiate between those who invest for a return at the time of retirement and those who live from their pensions.
A good to rent or two for a couple on top, it's vice
The little genius of Finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of major works, but at a time of lack of large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline emerges in response to a recession that is only a wild and brutal decline
You would have been right 30 years ago: no more need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investment is glaring: insulation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc...
A tax that favours high incomes and annuitants.
Who's in power?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallopin.
Samsung’s profits are hurt by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple's mid-September introduction of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all of these phones and decided for the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft implemented this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people attach no value to the design, for them options, functionality and price prevail.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for "a better platform".
Is there "a better car manufacturer," not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
That's what we're all interested in.
I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it wasn't an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most of the people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who according to one of them fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, of course Parisian bobos) could tell us which author(s) they fight ideas about gender and tell us the books they intend to fight precisely.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmmour?
Well, Jean, I like you, and you're smart and educated.
I said this about Judith in Furusato's vein evoking Holopherne, rapprochement that had not come to me (I don't have her vivacity of mind).
Otherwise, in the background, since you're referring to it, I'm not interested in this subject, and honestly I don't see what the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my back, because I'm slow but I understand well...
@ Jean: Recognize that culturally, send Judith back to Holopherne, it does.
Who's afraid of the world?
But what are we afraid of those who are afraid?
Furasato and @ give us some answers.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat slicer.
We can see how intimate these studies are at home.
We are obviously no longer in the debate of ideas.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: With regard to an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
Pretending to fight ideas on the basis of the only exposure made to them by their critics (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Genre or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem to me very rigorous.
But, as I was explaining to our UMPfrontist friend, it's all the difference between having an enlightened opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I contented myself with the "Second sex" (it was more of my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a bit for the disappointment of sometimes having the sight blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really engulf the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Special flash blood moon.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey make the Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will give it back its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover the entire week with the meteor showers of the Perseids and for almost all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm starting to think there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to keep Melbourne's people from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are greatly improving on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I could not see the eclipse because of the clouds over the suburbs of Melbourne.
I'm gonna put a TAX on this eclipse.
Whoever looks at this eclipse should pay a TAX.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when he ends up (forcefully) disappearing?
It seems that you spent a lot of time reading the discussions by looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed.
Beautiful picture of the moon above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing about stock market and real estate speculation.
Nothing about inequality between income from labour and capital.
Nothing about tax evasion.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about Babylon's gardens...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hypertext link to the original documents so that an opinion can be made.
Go see today Tuesday, October 15 the results of miracle recipes: in Spain, exports have been at their lowest in five years.
In Greece the stock market is collapsing.
Yet these are the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim of around 8 billion euros.
The Department of the Economy tells us that these claims are not well-founded.
What if the Ministry of the Economy makes a mistake?
Will the decision-makers who have gained the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The rest in its own time.
Okay, thanks, JYL....
@lol No The state is not comparable to households in terms of the management of its budget because the time horizon of the state is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the life of its members.
Moreover, unless public expenditure is considered unproductive, it contributes to financing tangible and intangible investments that will ensure the growth of tomorrow and thus future revenues.
Some elements of the answer.
It's an unfortunate decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrates: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all else.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth doesn't match your fantasy.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands tied by the law as written by the politicians.
It is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical procedures, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money with drugs Since the Liberals want our health care system to look like the United States, you should find out how it works.
All over the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it's more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame doctors, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to business profits and "research."
Read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme expenditures and negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare world prices of drugs everywhere, as well as differences between countries on what is over-the-counter or prescription-only.
This is reinforced by a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that restrain them and the expensive permits required.
Although manufacturers of some drugs may not be happy with the use of alternatives such as marijuana, those who arrive at a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a hospital manager.
We can't hold patents on grass...
If "researchers" in the social sciences were doing research instead of policy and networking, they might be able to use their "work."
One researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing isn't looking.
Comparing is doing pedagogy not research.
One cannot say "research is successful it must be applied" and then in the same jet "you must experiment at all goes".
If your research is successful, why experiment?
If your research isn't done, why are you asking us to apply it?
Can I be explained how a "researcher" can infer that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies allow students to learn on the condition that they learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they don't know how to learn?
Pisa tests are just an indicator that makes it possible for us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What's the point of building an indicator that informs you of what's right for you, a will for self-promotion, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to keep sophists and ideologists away from training, and practitioners teach practitioners.
make reread the paragraph on the internships (which unfortunately is not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most inefficient conservatism: "It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of the practices in force, and that does not allow to advance the system " .
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be hoped that only practitioners will teach practitioners, even if they have a full place in modern teacher training.
Education theorists must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems in the education system.
Giving more weight to the theorists of education would destroy it permanently.
Your analogy is totally flawed: if I would not like to be operated on by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would even less like to be operated on by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned on the job.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative Member of Parliament to Combat Copyright Violation by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaier thank you.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright, it's enough for me to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = theft.
It is the same since they must cite their sources correctly.
Often, obtaining a license costs nothing.
No, it's a copyright violation.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without the proper license, you deprive artists of their livelihood.
You can always debate pedantic assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you like, it won't be true.
It's a copyright violation.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright
Obviously you don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should get money for pictures used in school homework, an almost perfect definition of what reasonable use should be, then I'm happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson #1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the general conditions they have passed by one click.
Maybe if they share the headphones of their mp3 walker with a boyfriend on the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way.
Ah if we could export that resource we're abounding in, the grunt that says everything's wrong...
If a PS MP says so, then we have to believe it.
I have two children and when they are of choice, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by continually assisting them.
I don't want my children to bear the debt this policy has created.
What pulls France down is speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in a private company for a long time.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies run by excellent entrepreneurs: it exists in France but it is rare.
I am an employee because I know I don't have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls at the lame bosses I meet frequently.
At ease in my sneakers I totally share Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan's post: he tells the horrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with the German companies that the French entrepreneurs constantly cite to ask for reforms in France, in Germany the companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between the large companies and the medium-sized and small ones - What do the French bosses expect to do the same ??
Let the state hold their hand?
That state they're accusing of imperity?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-business couplet on your part!
Remind me, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French entrepreneurs who are unable to create jobs and who are bouncing and minauding while waiting for the permanent assistance of the State!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, 45 hours a week paid work 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand lower wages if not their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
Which is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From what I see from where I am, Last has not really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep afloat rather than transform themselves.
That doesn't mean the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of them.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do this, unfortunately.
I tried to get them recently, but I didn't make it.
Well, the Labour is gonna get us in trouble, isn't it...
It's an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
There is nothing to prevent people in the UK from setting up a more moral company and taking part in calls for tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticisms when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision could finally be overturned.
And it's better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won Crossrail's operating contract for 8 years.
Well Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally for pooling and sharing and believes that workers must all help each other across borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision ;)
It may be because the Dutch are on good track while the British are not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but, above all, new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"She was a beating girl."
God, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being a "beater" is a higher quality than many others, caring for others, intelligence, listening, for example, being a "beater" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "beaters", who are still dead, I know palanques.
Coming out of an illness has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, let's do it again, too.
I'm not telling you this is the condition to manage, I'm telling you that it helps..
Nothing to do with any merit...!
When to the example of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'll do it again.
Insinuating, if only for a moment, that you can have merit to get out of an illness or that you can demerit not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that looses, everywhere, in spite of the will, in spite of the confidence in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
I'm sorry to think the opposite, if having a solid morale makes it easier to accept heavy treatment and prepare for it, to try experimental treatments like this woman did and not to refuse them out of fear.
Someone who fights in medicine is above all someone who trusts medicine.
But if we prefer to rely on the "seigneur" it's something else..
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you get stripped to the point of becoming just a zombie.
Personally, I've caught two of them, dirt, fat ones, and if I've "fighted" like those fine psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight is just to hold your teeth, suffer hell and take the blows.
I thought the accusation against Milosevic had been decided and finalized a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers in at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted "rapidly" and then swept under the carpet.
Is that the story we told back then?
The communist who became a nationalist who unleashed three wars in the Balkans over the past decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please question what we have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under THE MOINDRE rule of international law?
Which country did Serbia attack?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out of this: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended him, he'd be swallowed by the Western compressor.
The Westerners used a smoke screen to detach a part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was readily recognized by the Western states that then lied end-to-end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term for failing to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Ultimately, the Guardian should not call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we do not like him).
To my knowledge, there is only one method for predicting earthquakes in Greece that works roughly by measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
Such studies are undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet called HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules", according to a study conducted by the team of Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
Method to follow.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat happen.
Thank you Passeur de sciences to delight us, often, with these experimental prowess that are realized in the world.
How would animals know (in advance )?
No doubt by the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
An a priori odourless gas for man but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments at his disposal.
But we have no reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including hens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an arte report about the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian and the other Japanese, to make recognize the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and in particular their modification before a seism.
So of course I'm not a scientist but their assumptions convinced me!
Where are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this trail?
We should learn to listen to nature again...
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious magazine, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by the animals, we encounter the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish turned strangely in circles.
I don't understand that we could think that Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He's done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to LBC's program you can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and that he's always trying to distract with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor and he didn't keep one.
It just highlights how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because she's a celebrity and people have been taught the adoration of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him, and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will burst the ceiling I'm sure.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but don't want their Prime Minister to be one of them.
That's exactly what they used to say about Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpaing, smarter than him.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French were truly and always disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have bothered to read some books (there are some, including a French and excellent from B.
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "Strait of Scrap" speak, unfortunately as much as the dead who remained there.
It is understandable that Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, the Australia, must always be there from the bottom of the battle of Savo) do not want to go back.
We actually passed the island of Savo in the Iron Bottom Sound.
Even though the mission is coming to an end.
It's the little ones.
But the ecolo side is a total smoke.
Calculate the kerozene consumes to achieve the goal completely decriminalizes the concept..
Just browse the list of sponsors that philanthropists.
One more com operation neither done nor did.
The cow, it makes you want too much!!!
I'm looking forward to the webseries!
Your recit makes me see again, identifying myself a little bit in passing (I also learned to sail with the Crocos de L'Elorn at the Moulin Blanc in Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, although some criticise the impact of displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to make us see, and proudly show that the Bretons are great travelers!

Good evening I think the red hat that demonstrated against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not spend a dime of our taxes on financing the dreams of some adventurers even as friendly as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian formation who are of Kosovar origin?
I know Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly in Juventus and now in Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still on the team.
It's Bisevac Lyon's defenseman, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfielder or before in the 70s and 80s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in the large team of Velez who, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also counted such size as Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful team-mate of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at the Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *fisson*
Now I can't help you.
I know that he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he's not the holder.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is, the flag of this drone isn't the flag of real Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all the regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (as I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give parts of the country to neighbouring countries.
How can you have felt "an explosion of joy" when you see two towers collapse knowing that women, men and children without doubt are inside?
How???
What bothers me a little in this "testimony" is that the mere fact of having been able, at least once, spontaneously to rejoice at the horrible deaths of thousands of people, bears witness to a personality "border line" whose "testimonies" should be taken with the greatest caution.
No doubt that in the short moment of "joy", we will not have thought of the dead or of the reality of the horror inflicted.
We just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to do truly and apocalyptically evil to the great wicked Satan in his very heart.
To do a powerful qqch.
Great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims who feel humiliated.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We thought so.
The Western "Christian/White/Gaulois" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the musuman when he contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Arab Muslim world.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the Dubai towers.
The past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How can we get the Muslim world out of this evil funnel?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigate the Arab world l: the bigot conservatism of the powers in place and fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
That we've understood before, mustn't push back the Muslims.
It's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I guess that's true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, damp and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm in pain myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and for those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the summer green when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls a weekend.
We had a nice summer this year, don't make your grumpy clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now I'm retired and I'm no longer developing immunity to outside germs, it can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a febrileness that culminates with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and many other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
These are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and grey months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child increments , the amount received by the State comes mainly from the deciles 8 to 10 .
However , with regard to the number of households that have seen their taxes increase as a result of this measure , deciles 4 and 5 ( median income ) are mainly affected , according to Chart 2 .
The deletion of the half share concerning especially widows is not at all dealt with in the article or rather its impact is completely undervalued: 230M euros it is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not going to work out.
Well, we're not on straw, but dreamers.
For once the PS makes a rather left-wing policy we won't cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let us continue this way and you will encourage these 20% less to work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live the Trots and OCI recycled at the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you don't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population holds 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it forbids anyone to raise as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit the money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money is exceeded, money is used only to make money, that is to say to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We're one of the richest 20%.
Probably also of the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth of which part is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or else we might as well give up and live in social minima, especially if we have social housing.
The utopias of the red Khmer head cutters have fortunately lived.
I did two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or deal with any hassle.
All you have to do is go to someone's house, sleep there, put back behind you and go back.
From now on, this will be my first option when I'm on a trip.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need a kind of owner's insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, six hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" No, it's not.
You just really missed luck.
Based on the link provided in the article:
In its discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an e-mail provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he did not receive any support from Airbnb?
I ADORE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hi, I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I'm thinking of paying a down payment and a month's rent at once, but I'm a little afraid to send £1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
Where are we going?
"Supporting the troops," sang the Bu$herie in all its tones...
So, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I am sure that it will please the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurdish who died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussain.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is irrelevant (to remain polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
It is not very clear the style of the author: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education.
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: This is ALWAYS the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if they were to be "worked" 35 hours instead of 17.
On time, our teachers currently earn more than engineers.
And that we are not made to believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their curriculum.
But it can't be seen since National Education doesn't have the means to provide an office to the college/lycée to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in short, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, Internet connection, or supplies.
Besides, it's so much the hideout at 5:00 p.m. a week and four months of vacation that we can't fill the Math CAPES, come on, we're waiting for you.
What do you mean, you don't want to coltinate with miseducated bastards whose parents spit on you by calling you a jerk?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the Kurdish population can flourish better.
Where we can see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first graduate job was in the sale in London, earning three times nothing and yet it was a position for which a diploma was required.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London subway, it was paid £5,000 more a year and they didn't even apply for a patent.
I never regretted it.
In this regard, don't worry if you don't find a graduate job, try to find something that either pays well or that you like to do.
If I had stayed on to graduate jobs, I would still be paying my student loan.
I don't like corporate work so much, so I hope to eventually move into either the public service or the academic world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a backlog of three years.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of bisounours as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is to say what are called unemployed diplomas.
I have one of these degrees and I've finished production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree but, as the above article says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
Certainly the starting salary was lower but the steps are rapidly rising because in the real world what counts is results more than knowledge.
This debate engineering/artistic courses have been going on for years.
Scientists cannot solve all problems, it is more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people in order to achieve results.
Letters, philosophy and art are bisounour channels?
That's ridiculous.
I guess you're talking about degrees like media studies or whatever absconse branch you went to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real subjects.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn't it be better to have a real territorial policy to relieve the congestion in Paris and boost the rest of France?
Personally, I don't see the inhabitants of the bottom of the Essonne and Val-d'Oise go 80km every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
The inhabitants of the interior and the small belt already have many means of public transport that are much more practical (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and locked parks, as already exist in the cities of northern Europe, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the roads.
Good idea.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
We might as well benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we didn't find a place for ONE ONLY bike hooking device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not okay at all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other users of public transport the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that come out are: 1/ it is hyper dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that drive super fast and don't care about the survival of the bikes 2/ we get full of pollution in the head For me the bike paths are worse go, we have to reduce the motor traffic (urban toll type congestion load), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), enforce the code of the road by verbalizing systematically (even the bikes to the flat near that we have to adapt the code of the road written for cars 100 years ago to the bikes), generalize the buffer zones after the nailed passages, not before otherwise cars and scooters do not bother each other.
Cycle paths are apartheid, we must coexist but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Anything on the bike in the big Paris?
Not a word about the place of cycling in public transport?
EELV is right.
The goal of 15% of bike trips is ridiculous.
I'm starting to think Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
Moreover, according to what OR reports, the EELV deputies seem sceptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find out who really hides behind this massacre.
It's not Russia.
I'm not sure I like the way the world is evolving.
That sounds awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer has expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
In addition, they would have to file complaints first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the air space security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had previously been shot down, Ukraine was launching air attacks on the rebels in the area, and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with innocent people's lives so that airlines pay for the rights of way over the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurping government / ultra-nationalists of Western Ukraine - and who want to show basically that Putin shot down the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The previous one: a 1986 ruling of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the supply of arms by the CIA to the Contra rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
No chance that Russia will let this case go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think that Abbott wants to tell Putin that Australians have been murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations.
So far the investigators have said nothing like that.
To be called Ricardo and to be such a benetian in eco, it is distressing!
Calling Polaire is losing the north is rejoicing.
Only one question from Béotien: Is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can't help but notice that those who criticize Piketty's book the most virulaly have not read it!
It's easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of income from labour, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of today's capital joins that of the beginning of the 20° before 1914, it shows that it is the 2 world wars that have reduced the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this cobblestone knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limitations.
Secondly, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is fair, we can debate it without having read the book, the main thing being to argue in a one-way way in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did you take to read it?
Is the central thesis of its pedestal summarized by the press false?
I haven't read and won't read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and it is this one that seems pure fumistry to me.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Hasn't humanity been enriched in general?
And this addition to population growth is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and definitely deserves the prize.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age at which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this prize will not be a burden on the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old saying that colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
All my wishes for happiness to Malala, but she must realize that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighborhoods of Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she were not where she is now, she would have been married at the age of 14.
Isn't Malala herself one of those "colored perverts"?
You should not have any "airtime" on this site.
You yourself are a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father ran a school where girls were educated and was in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, so that she receives a higher education and has the right to decide her own marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he believes that women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl must often marry at 14, without having a say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it eloquently enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at the age of 14.
Rather disappointed by this entry into season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who obviously has some difficulty finding her character of Marlene Dietrich.
I just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and the show by Jessica Lange singing Bowie's anachronistic Life on Mars is simply stunning.
I haven't seen this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I prefer to suddenly watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is for sure, apart from Jessica Lange extraordinary, it is especially the risks of staging and editing that surprised me.
We have an avalanche of original plans in AHS that makes a lot of fun of the asepticization of today's productions.
I can't see you throwing the sponge in advance for the next few seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge its quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things.
No, it's simply that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series apart from technical qualities.
And well, I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, it wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's gonna end up like 24 hours time what.
But everyone does what they want!
It is by what I say "I won't look anymore" that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I just share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think it will be fatal.
But then, here it is, it's just my opinion.
Let's talk less tax increases, please - let's cut in government spending instead.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to save in expenses failed.
Trigger controversy over relatively small expenditure items, such as development aid
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of orientation that voters seem to call for from their wishes and throughout this time some, in each side, pretend that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
“Debt” is assets held primarily by financial institutions in that country.
"Debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government taking over a third of my income (before even talking about taxes on consumption) if I thought he was going to use it wisely.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes, but if you add up our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to wind turbines that are almost useless and nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should, you come to a figure that makes the Labour and Lib-Dem taxes on the most luxurious homes seem ridiculous.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 a year will pay about £5,000 (one seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (one fifth), etc., and someone with £200,000 will pay about £70,000 (just over a third).
What about social security contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car sticker, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is collected at source before local taxes and the car sticker.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let's not pretend that money falls from the sky, or that it's not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes go.
How can an unemployed person looking for door-to-door work prove it?
Even so, 20% of the unemployed would not look, which means that 80% seek and do not find.
Being unemployed myself, do I have a better interest in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 resumes, it increases my chances so much.
Indeed, I haven't heard from Emploi in months, does that mean that agents are more busy in control operations than actually getting job advertisements in?
I don't see the point.
Because it's not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough jobs, then it is necessary to do without Pole Emploi.
How is this a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that the unemployed fulfil their duties well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller requests their transport title from users of a means of transport, a head of service or are the employees of their work, etc.
Nobody yells at the scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to recall that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had dealt with Pôle Emploi, my rights to ARE had been wrongly established, and on one of the files, cut by 40%, it was necessary to fight firm.
It takes time!
I'm not a law expert.
The fiche and control is now taking over, while Pôle Emploi is in fact close to being an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees, they are the ones who pay for the sidelines.
Politicians and non-salaried French people give themselves rights that they do not have in fact!
It's not normal.
I would add that decent unemployment insurance contributes to the enhancement of paid work.
More than waiting for murder tweets in Arabic...
In reality we need a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the black plague in 1348/9 in connection with war and population displacements at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit to ban this year the Hadj in Mecca to Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 people had their visa applications refused because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of spirit.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from taking a plane to Europe?
I thought it was simple common sense but apparently those "who know" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be strictly quarantined.
No one's going out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they get the Ebola virus while they're there, they stay there until they're cured.
These are not drastic measures.
Just last week, people were contaminated after having had contact with people in West Africa, although they took "all the necessary precautions".
We can stop the progress of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let us forbid them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be immediately quarantined.
That he succeeds in conveying the message of the first individual and of the second group (including religious) and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is capable of erecting in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It is still far from that conception there.
It's only 20 years since information has appeared as humanity's prime, while religion, born of the cerebellum, has been leading our actions since maybe Lucy.
What is the point of becoming an umpteenth Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely minority in France today, no one is forced to adhere to it.
Those who criticize would not set foot in the Church anyway, it is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
@louise: Sorry the church does not have a limited vision to France.
And in the world, maybe that will make it possible to reach more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you see it existed before Christ.
Hillel a century before said to him already: "Do not do to others what you do not want to be done to you, this is the whole Torah and the rest is only comment: go and study!".
Christianity goes far beyond a mere reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "advance justice, peace, fraternity" but without god?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: We take away the incarnation and the resurrection.
Jesus will remain this hero who has changed moral laws by redefining the respect of others.
Christians will then be ready to take on their role in the ethical debates in our societies and advance justice, peace and brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then forcibly converted and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much between buying this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It's not made up.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even took part in his fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll check it out.
Of course not at work.
The hackers in the IT department block all the cool sites.
Hello, is it £30 then 20% discount, or does the £30 include the 20% discount?
Warning however: the PC version is only for DX11.
It caught me by surprise, I bought it, but can't play it.
Plus I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it sucks.
It's time to buy a new video card.
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that someday they'll wipe it out of your library if they decide to crack down on the people who buy it there while they're out of the area.

Thus, was France of 1940 a "putrid land"?
That Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
You have to love the France of 40, the "strange defeat"?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize in literature, you wonder if Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano who is already hard to read in French and who describes such a limited and egocentric universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt that.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant connection with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They'll be able to appreciate Mr.
Modiano at its fair value, if they don't already know him!
For your part, keep dating Lévy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso retain all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hey, ugly guys.
Ever since I drove one to Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sportage all over the place.
I think this thing followed me here.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the beer and cider party in Nottingham.
It was messy.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not only CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with the camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather's house to play Nine Card Brag.
Thanks to a real beginner's chance I was able to leave with several decent bets.
I hope if I get to 95, I'll be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a fancy cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire Mr.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
Having said that, without wishing to upset you, I think you're moving a little away from the subject.
This famous whole, it forbids quests for jihadists at the exit of mosques.
It immediately reports arms trafficking.
Either we have big open eyes like Meddeb and Taïa or Boubaker or we have big closed eyes.
We have to choose.
It's not by keeping your eyes closed that you get to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you are making a monumental counter-sens: all the representative authorities, organisations or associations, Muslim or not, having formally condemned the IS and its crimes, the French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Who doesn't say a word consents.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some people doubt the approval of the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and to demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt them.
In my view, this principle is the negation of the republic and can only contribute to undermining French society.
If there is no doubt, let's say so.
Who doesn't say a word consents, but consents to what?
Consent to proximity to IS or conviction of IS.
Silence is practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to care for the goat and cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has widened between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified at the idea of losing all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't care about Scotland because they don't sit there.
They can do what they want with electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a long-term good thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's going to shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMESSE" thinking that he was saving his party but without realizing that he was signing the death sentence of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs hold their leader to account.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they have promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's more important.
Not if Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Ciing the pumps by 8% at the expense of 85% is not a great electoral strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs are no longer able to vote on matters affecting England, the Conservatives will win all votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists, and it worked well for her.
However, he is still running to be prime minister in 2015 and has since won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each player to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is "The life of others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
Ultimately, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next post: Amazon makes YOUR book according to YOUR profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's gay as a world.
Strongly stimulating.
Thanks for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have to read pirated files, books in the public domain or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without bugs.
Given the price I paid for the Kobo, it's no regrets.
I am amazed at the widespread abdication of users in the face of widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your general public bookseller, you will always notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are probably derisory.
For example » Finnegans Wake » by James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the Big Data era, data doesn't really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in the same baccalauréat.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile....
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that are not able to identify readers or authors.
But Kobo has all this information.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be headed by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenic acid kids.
It's even worse than that if you take Erdogan's religious fundamentalism into account.
It's interesting that some Erdogan supporters think that Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Good view:-P But Turkey does not want to shoot itself in the foot, unless it gains something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will retaliate, so it's actually shooting a bullet in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: "The PA reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious warning of reprisals there or simply advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region."
The reading of Indian Punchline is highly recommended to anyone who pays attention to details rather than to the c*nneries balanced by the traditional media. The short article you give the link to is important and should be read with in mind the previous realistic observations / warnings from Iran to propose Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderates" who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time ISIS's perverts?
Pipeline policy pushes the world to the edge and I would suggest to those who refer to non-existent "moderates" to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
"It's even worse than that if you take Erdogan's religious fundamentalism into account" Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
There should be a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Is it "need"?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the slightest chance of being alive?
A little late for that, buddy...
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like 120 years?
A little late for that, don't you think?
Particularly concerning the CUP triumvirate that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after World War I by vengeance by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a shaky place of Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding there a Turkish empire.
What a delusion!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek in vain contact with the real.
All clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even in the belly of a surrogate mother.
Lesbian couples may just have a child's desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Heterosterile couples, too.
As for the children!
What a shame to call them psychologically unbalanced futures.
One day, they will be old enough to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their living and to pay for this lady's retirement (?)
GPA is probably a provisional "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
It's not from today.
Many women carried and gave birth to children who were not of their husbands.
It is still so, we are so done...
The important thing in this area is that this practice is regulated so that the "marketization" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, aren't cosmetics as commodification of bodies?!
Anakronik Fareinheit ...
It is certainly more elegant to make a maid grow up in distant countries via the internet and Pay Pal than to shoulder his responsibilities and avoid the scandal in another centuries near home without shouting at that time on all the roofs! ...
These practices were also not made in the name of the church! ...
It is not just Christians and believers who refuse these practices ...
Nevertheless, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh, shut up, this man is passionate about something.
In the late '70s in the Midlands I only saw that from afar.
I had to go during the day because I had no right to go at night!
But if you like it and listen to music - this music today it always touches you as much.
I don't know why there are so many contemptuous comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there's a football article waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there has been a shortage of reports that truly reflect the reality of Northern England's culture.
No wonder Paul Mason understood the social and political context, he understood things well.
The Northern soul is still alive, but it has been vamped by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can throw an ear at it if you are in the London area in November: 99psoul will again pass soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story", but here is a little article well written and well thought out.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're glad you escaped Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.
Gobbling pills.
Whatever the station before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the police series George Gently entitled Gently Northern Soul, which takes place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is getting more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (as was the case with Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters have all preferred occupation-colonization over peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock and entered the water.
An Israeli had stolen them from him.
The Israeli representative rose up angry and shouted, "What are you talking about?
The Israelis were not even there at the time!".
The Palestinian representative (UN) said: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not let down the guard...
That it displeases the anti-Israelis is obvious, that is not the goal sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And this is still the case since the Policy is globalized ...
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonial conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it endures!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What balance of power has allowed Israel to be created?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still today a balance of power!
Do you doubt it?!!! ...
Besides, it's not all about Russell Brand, but the Guardian's reporters seem to be having a hard time going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
Many of what he says are only pseudo-chomskyist marbleds written no others.
That proves you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes her, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, perhaps truths that one prefers not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand Horripile some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids it actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but the whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos that he posted, he says that voting once every five years only for Labour or Conservatives (or Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting democratic engagement to this is completely useless, the two parties (to a slightly different degree) governing essentially in favour of particular interests, multinational companies and the rich, at no time does he say to simply ignore politics completely because these parties do not rule on our behalf: he insists that rather than just vote and disconnect for five years, people should become much more politically active at the local level, organize movements, demonstrations, petitions, whatever and try to influence politics from that.
I am not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active in presenting his requests can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are weather vanes that will change their minds if they really risk losing the elections), but it's rage to see all these condescending answers that say that this idiot who makes Jesus tells the young people not to bother to vote and just to hope that everything will get better because it really distorts his arguments.
Its solution is extremely debatable and it would be good if people were to debate what it actually says rather than simply label it as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of it and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The voting thing was completely distorted.
The pointlessness of sliding a ballot into a ballot box every five years makes me deeply angry because my vote really doesn't count for anything.
I want more referendums, e-voting, direct democracy and Members who report locally to their voters.
In addition, I dispute the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even if they are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "Pseudo-chomskyist billeves".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, let Suzanne do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, even with the head-to-head peculiarities added to the editing!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russel but eventually became one of his fans and invited him on his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he's going with it.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This "fronde" reveals above all to me that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the rendez-vous of history where professional historians have become minority and where exchanges of specialists have become impoverished to the benefit of condensed loan-to-think type Sciences Po for press kits.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to attack a guilty man, a scapegoat.
They develop both very rational reasonings, but this rationality rests on these scapegoats, which are the cornerstone of their thinking.
Rather, I believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This is a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also the magic thought.
We solve the problem of the relationship with each other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchizing slope, neo-lib and / or /libertary (of the two terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing how to go to seek the help of the state for its markets) in the sense of at least state / not at all state at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organizes nicely.
His thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt it does not stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a stand against the three intellectuals quoted here.
Nor any support for it.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its then god, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a cabbage too quickly if you took Foucault's texts about the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel by this means...
Gauchet raises a profound reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the membership mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he's an original and respectable thinker.
Seeing this cabal orchestrated by researchers in the humanities of the hard left who can't bear to pass from allegiance to their mantras, is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other "yellows" I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I last saw a Chinese man.
In London and they were nice to me when they found out I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same about white people!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them speak violently anti-white.
My dad's not happy his eldest daughter's dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity is spreading outside of the big cities, and through this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, the Russians are mostly prejudiced against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or face high levels of crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the river Ienissei, in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard Australians' views on Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I can't stand the Chinese, while I've met two in my life (one of them abroad), didn't keep bad memories, all people are worth it and, in fact, those in London were very nice, that's the only reason I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don't remember who we meet, all people are worth it, how to remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here speak of the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with said white.
How many Chinese men are with whites, by comparison?
None, because there's a lot of chance that the parents of these whites would assault them PHYSICALLY.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all the battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked to the left like the trade union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: I'm sorry, but the judicial community is quite rightfully branded.
When in the Judicial Union, he represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of bias can be made based on the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it orders that two obstacles be removed.
That of the observer's political vision as well as that of the judge's factual interpretation.
This remains the law's necessary tool for refocusing assessment on fundamentals.
The measure of its non-compliance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including public prosecutors, forces a distinction to be made between error and partiality of magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice were not distributed among these three groups.
The claim and the lack of knowledge are not an objective analysis.
And if all this is not analysed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If it is only by statistics implicitly revealing that it is going from very low.
The previous preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
The corruption of the judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area considered is that of the plundering* of heirs committed until the means of frauds at the procedure* by genealogists succeeding commissioned by notaries.
This profession gets 150 million euros a year while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
For the purpose of understanding their mechanism, some of them were reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this joins the so-called statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, it is because the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogist and heirs reluctant to be so robbed, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all laws favorable to heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring this kind of rational criteria then an elaborate form of lying?
Prices must be totally prohibitive.
More equipment to scam people with disabilities.
You can say that, but my brother has one of those all-terrain tricycles, custom built to his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never a normal wheelchair, with cumbersome wheels and tires, couldn't.
As they say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
Tankchair looks EPIQUE.
I don't think the inventor of the Whill ever had to clean a dog's spit on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the all-terrain tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a longboard penchant.
Here there are hills that they would like.
The prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put that kind of price on a bike, so "you see."
The all-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all disabled people are poor, though.
Many of them have reasonable insurance at their disposal.
Only if they've become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know they are necessary for us.
You can't really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a draft, it's not intended to be manufactured.
I'm CONTENT that the "long distance" wheelchair doesn't get to the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombardments of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been trapped in the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying Power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half of them are children and young people under the age of 18.
The eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade!
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation, an illegal situation too, since the blockade imposed a “collective penalty” on all civilians in Gaza.
"The entrepreneurs who work on their projects divert a little bit from their cement to the black market " ...
Ah, that's not the tongue of wood, rather concrete and armed the lady...
References are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist ...
The right cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, that's for sure, and recognized.
Two million human beings have been trapped in the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world that is unacceptable to anyone with a heart and a moral sense.
The United States has a well-guarded land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded him!
Remember also that after lifting it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Egyptian-Israeli ...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built upside down by the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought it through.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the sharing economy, not for profit.
Many are only looking for a one-night shot on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping) in another way.
It's always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, owners and tenants who trust each other often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this?
"What she hires on"?
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
The verb "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you haven't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure that it is 100% compliant with all the safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers permission to practice a commercial activity there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I have tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and painted, sunk, etc.?
The barges are so slow that if someone tried to steal it it would always be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our barges...
Where are you going to moor it?
No Marine Le Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than the one that exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
Increasing wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to get poorer!
High finance, speculation, plays with our companies, so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our foodstuffs, so our food, with the care structures so our health, with our debts so our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our money they hold.
All this for the benefit of a few hyper-mega-obeses of money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former minister of the economy at Rothschild Bank to better defend the interests of banksters, who were the only ones responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Wasn't there anyone else who could do it?
What do you call this: turn his jacket, put down his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
Actually, we don't really know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I'm not sure Spee really "refused" to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book " Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was rough at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Falklands, where, in the photos showing survivors being rescued, we see a calm sea in broad daylight.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this point.
Hmm, it's not exactly what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two battleship cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after stopping the fire, and a chase race began.
Leipzig saw something on fire, but as he got closer he saw that it was just a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, leaning and severely damaged but still moving.
After pointing his spotlight on the vessel's flag, the proposal to surrender was refused and he opened fire, finally flowing the vessel.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged the Good Hope to have escaped and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Concerned by reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he set course north."
So, if this is true, the Germans, groping in the dark before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not look for survivors.
They also thought there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have severely damaged them, so in confusion they went out to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should make a way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already harmed them and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes were raised at the UMP to request that it be included in the law that an elected representative who had been finally convicted should therefore be permanently ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect elected representatives from the left, of course.
But no, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSE A REGISTER TO THE CONS OF THE MAGISTRATES
When will the ban on trade unions in the already protected sectors come to pass?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to tame those who will take advantage of their unmovability to hinder the actions of the real politicians, who are really trying to move things forward, not the beautiful speakers whose immobilism is to the extent of their sufficiency.
I met them on the subway around noon with their little signs "subs for justice" they came from the provinces and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of its party.
It would not defend the same arguments if right-wing, or even extreme-right-wing, trade unions were to target personalities on its side and waged a legal-media war against them.
Your claims are totally free.
If, at the moment, the right defrays the judicial news, it is simply that it committed acts that fall within the scope of it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with Justice, but not all of those who have been the subject of his attention have been treated favourably.
On the other hand, it must also be remembered that the left-wing judicial union is not the only judicial union and that it is a minority.
That a minister supports unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you cite may be a minority among magistrates, but its influence is great at the Chancery, it's not a secret.
It is now questioned whether the "mission" of some judges is no more dirty than instructing.
@ gus - You should be satisfied, the DM is minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Peony: You forget that magistrates are not civil servants like any other: they are the only ones who have the power to impeach and imprison the all-one-each.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the most glory-hungry idiot realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I'd be surprised if someone would accept their offer.
Many used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
One Direction fills all the stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all did the Eurovision competition, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of British television's light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that's what happens anyway to most of the stars who don't participate in the contests.
Few of those who, after a tube, manage to make others.
In any case, most singers/groups can at best expect three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the UK.
His fame comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock path, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar-smokers who smoke grass in their father's garage and throw three chords on a primary school poem will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before even releasing an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that quickly turns to racism, because sacralist ethnologists present these distant people as infinitely superstitious and mixed with ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, from practical considerations on a daily basis.
Except that you are imprudently interpreting in the opposite direction.
Either, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it better not to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is recalled to see the sacred as a kind of object well defined and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article in any case.
It's deco phemere to furnish the void.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw into the nettles interpretations not at all scientific that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When does a comparative review of disciplines make you laugh a little?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is quite unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, precious testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and earlier archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and their knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Nowadays we have technical and scientific means so powerful that the interpretation of excavations is better but can always be called into question by other discoveries!
One is there in full (and old) polemic on shamanism advanced by the pre-historian Jean Clottes (cf his book "Les chamanes de la préhistoire", especially the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published by the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this informative article
Straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could get started.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't keep on with three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we're not against a play on that.
We couldn't watch a musical on that, however, that would be too gay!
We could expect that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost complete, may I suggest you move on to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays true journalists, brave, so that they write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own risk.
Instead of making a laugh with these childish ass jokes.
Not very clever.
Go away then.
If these "childish ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
You also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that upsets you, or is it the fact that people laugh at it?
Nevertheless we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
amateur video of the crash on the net... ??
If the FOM chose not to show these images, it was only to protect its interests under no circumstances those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots it would have pulled out the safety because at the time another vehicle (tow truck, for example) entered the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it appropriate to advance the time of departure (TV right, pub, money...).
But other than that, they're good at protecting the pilots.
Well, I also share that view.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have at the restaurant a chance to beat the English who led then...
You're dropping off on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I've got a little time to flush out all your shit.
No, just no.
There have been lots of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts commissioners in danger of death for a distant story of the possibility of victory of one pilot at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that takes out safety because it's the FIA.
Waistiness.
In view of the amateur images, the absence of an image especially allows the FIA to avoid the annoying questions of the type: How is it that the commissioner shakes a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident, but because one of the commissioners is clearly waving a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that one is more under the yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a gloomy misconception of the F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the rule of yellow flag AFTER the place of the accident, hence the agitated green flag.
That's the usual procedure.
The clerk position just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be at 10 meters as at 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal look.
The sensationalism makes the pub sell.
Before I thought the media was an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid that, in the end, it's just for the money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, fear of not having sex life, advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The news does exactly the same thing.
Doing the buzz with information that we really don't need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so we can keep them under control.
"When the tabloid coughs about Ebola, we all catch fear" It should be "crash," not "cough."
Given the medical reference, "coughing" is much better said in this context than "derailing".
I wonder if all the people who panic that Ebola could start spreading by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You do them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You're confusing Ebola with Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that beautifully and firmly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh.
It depresses me that the media talk about most things with this optimism upside down.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and anxious (without reaching hysteria) for the government can get us to slip when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we have to undergo a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Is there not something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be still in this world almost 35 years later.
Besides, at first it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980-90s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of going there for years .....
Testimony completely useless.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only do testimonies serve no purpose: taken in isolation, they cannot be used as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@trafic: Testimonies cannot be used as a scientific material.
Perhaps that's why we don't ask questions to psychiatric patients when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric file mentions that my mother psychiatrist explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's a subjective testimony that doesn't matter.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is useless in a scientific approach?
So what do you base the research on, then?
On fantasies?
You put at the same level fantasy theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies) ?
"Resilience": the phony word adulated by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who think they are great psychologists after reading D'Ansembourg.
@Jim: There are lots of empty buzzwords in the psyches.
Cyrulnik hit us with "resilience".
Since he's a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he's brainstormed us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from farage and company??
Doesn't that remind you of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to get Sentinels out of the air...
And why is that?
It was a great show and it looks like those who come out of it are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang up?
The only solution that comes to mind is humor like pee-caca, which would kill the show.
It was already a children's show.
The kids hung up.
Ah, because it's a children's show?
UKIP works for the Mysterons.
Why don't you keep your Team America?
Still in Supermarionation?
It won't be the same if you don't see the wires and the animation is done well. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although being an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain to redifuse the old ones.
The show has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; we've had one-hour episodes on Saturday and Sunday at 6 a.m. for at least 40 years.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-rate commercial channels and we can still see it at these times.
And in addition the half-hour episodes now pass at 5:30 a.m., Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a "sad" 60-year-old man, but I don't watch this show every day!
There is no "Mont du temple" in or under the mosque of the esplanades!!!
Radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations below and around the mosque of the esplanades for several decades have not made it possible to find anything.
The hill of the temple if it exists it is elsewhere.
May be in Argentine ??
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which was built the mosques esplanade.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, protrudes in the middle of the mosque of Omar.
For Muslims, Muhammad went up to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it was Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to remind them regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the two-state plan, and scuttled it continuously!).
It is also good to show how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Will God be able to recognize his own?
The shortest Jewish joke: "God be praised!"
To brag about tourism in Israel, we are often shown young, half-dressed Naïds, alanguic on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a beautiful propaganda work!
Too bad the Reuters photographer didn't take a picture of the hundreds of Palestinians who were allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who prefer to stifle the Jewish faithful below, praying at the Lamentation Wall.
@Mat, If this photo bothers you, it is right, it is not the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she transmits that must be condemned.
This system is not tenable and will end up crying.
The only way to put an end to this system is through the revolution.
Since the economy seems to be starting to spin, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever greater wages to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not tenable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of groaning and moaning when someone else strikes, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not just about their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not being bothered with with impunity.
Unless we give up democracy, in which case it's tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like, for example, China and India.
This can't end well.
That's because we're in a democracy.
Did you vote for the TTIP?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by bypassing national governments through secret courts.
It sounds incredible, but that's exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people about the unimaginable damage that this agreement will have to our lives.
It's only recently that we're starting to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated behind your back.
Did Churchill not say "blood, sweat and tears"?
These are great spinoffs, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, in the eighteenth there were unions in all the regiments
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let her (finally, her officers, the others, nobody knows anything) believe herself to be the safe of the eternal values of France, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even if for her, it's more and more uncomfortable...
You still miss the sindicat of married men, celibate women, married women, celibate women, lost dogs and I don't know what yet
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm a unionist.
You're being warned, it'll be your fault.
For the defence of the interests of the categories, the protected professions with trade unions have already suffered far enough, which has created a breach of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of risk on the part of a public servant.
One can very well imagine a system ensuring a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise insured catastrophe.
And with the carts preparing, the government welcomes them.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other civil servants, since this is the subject here commented...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in Article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker shall participate in the collective determination of working conditions and in the management of undertakings".
This is absolutely indispensable with the irruption of the informational power.
And yet you opened, probably read and then commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Bake Off review." ?????
Wait, the section was there, empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I've been watching, and I can tell you that some of them have been well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (although misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, pie mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a least-worse baker's victory; no one has done like "boom, here's my fucking cake now eat it and bow to your master"!
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and parents out there finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept out.
And there's also this idea of "playing security, there's always next week" that disappears the last week.
I like to cook, but I can't imagine doing this to myself.
I am grateful to those who do it and thus offer us great entertainment and push us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and they had to do one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to separate, I don't know how they were able to choose a winner.
At Luis's, the only real flaw they could find was the base a little dry (although I agree with Hollywood that the green frosting on Richard's mill did not make him want, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I must admit that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time allocated.
There's also cancer waiting, with solar wind strokes.
I'm sure it's all working out for us right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind with ultraviolet rays.
UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field were to weaken, there would not be enough solar wind to "hunt" ozone from the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and "cancer".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don't suspect.
If we limit ourselves to man they have the advantage of allowing us to have bones (synthesis of vitamin D), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks cancerous UVC and allows UVA and most UVBs to pass through.
You know you don't have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a leftover when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor clarification that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to demonstrate pedagogy.
Without saying that I'm a regular melanoma user, UV just ACCEEL its development.
They don't claim it.
As proof: not all tanned people have melanomas.
So, when a doctor tells you to avoid the sun and live in a cellar, it's better not to listen because UV is necessary for every human.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV causes melanoma directly.
Can we bend it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the blender?
Or switch it to the blender...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be folded if enough force is applied to it and the robustness of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the purpose for which it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resistant and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as front line communication equipment.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it
Except a Nokia 3310.
Specifically, is it already bent?
We make this joke in every conversation.
I've decided to count them.
This is the fourth folding joke I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone was removed from the main production line and we don't see how it could come back to it.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...................................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed properly and is therefore stuck with the installed plant test code.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But, would they put test software on all of them?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of a FCC or CE logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
ah l article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that industrialists produce in "industrial" We highlight super u but all the signs and meme the small trade are concerned How to eat good, organic avac 1650€ (average salary in france)?
But to answer your post, if it's possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After each one is free to put his priorities where he hears it.
For my part, food is one of them.
Go without grudge, I kiss you
We call bobos, or better boboecolos, people who see the world through ideological "software" that leads them to disconnect from reality.
This is total unbundling thought-reason.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example claim to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartufery, joining the left-wing caviar, from which they have sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartufery, too, do not be surprised to often encounter criticisms about them.
Wow, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the associated details (plane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't find myself there.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecolos are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of left-caviar?
Well, you're able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecologists.
Boboecolo is one of them but is only the most visible fringe of the ecologists because it is the one that infests the media.
Here's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look that giraffe in the face.
She's so badly made that she looks vaguely like a female nude.
Shh, you're next to the plate.
You have to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to make a comment since you haven't spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin does not know how to draw and still seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic ability.
That's art.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin can't draw
That's not really a fact.
It's more of an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke while playing billiards.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in that case.
Drawing is more than just representing the real.
If you're looking for only that, a camera will do the trick.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still room for savings: riding activities, the number of horses of the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
Honesty forces us to say that France is shrinking, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drasticly, starting with Great Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operation without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, at a time when we are looking at the weaknesses and shortcomings of our defence tool, particularly in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, which lose a dimension of their activities or even part of their history.
Where's the promised sanctuarization?
@edmond: That's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to save money but especially not at home, at home it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where the gabegie is certain.
Let all those who have little or no connection with the military thing dare to come and say here, eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting of laugh...
Applying the same potion to the whole of the public service and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really reloud: look at the inflation of public jobs in other ministries and you will understand why Defence can estimate itself a little loaded!
Well, yeah, the economies that everyone agrees they have to be made, they have to be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls moan at the murder when it happens at home, poor darlings.
It should be done, but above all, that it doesn't fall on me because, in this case, it's a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How to close the Val de Grace will weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for the local authorities, history was repeated with every post closure, maternity, hospital and barracks.
But everyone is for the economies of course.
It's weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and does not welcome the savings in public spending.
This article is really the most amazing thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It is depressing to scroll his Facebook feed and see that 80% of his friends started their status with the phrase "This embarrassing moment".
I think they're gonna make a movie out of it.
He will surely base himself on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus while going to work and only realizes that his skirt has entered his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's totally stupid.
Not really, in my opinion, the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and hold his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a Kate Bush fan, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
God, I have to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most incredible thing I've ever read!
Charlie really just showed that he's at the top of the cosmic universe of satirical journalism!
I'm falling for it!
It is imperative that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible fulgurance and unsurpassable genius that springs from Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine glow.
God, that was really lame.
Especially if they're not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development within democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Until further notice, we are being confiscated the right to save our planet by states that play the tartuffs at every meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take charge of things.
With the commissioner they planted with energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away ....
Translate: Wind turbines and solar farms are the Roundabouts of tomorrow.
All financed by the con-tribable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear discourse.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the industry is not controlled in its entirety, it is better to confine itself to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided, of course, that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is in no way concerned.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions at production and epsilon for the other steps.
Electricity through wind or PV renewables is already more GHGs on the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for the delay.
Replacing nuclear power with wind renewables or PV would run counter to the fight against CO2.
Christial I am not insulting you I am a state doctor in physical sciences 1981 and I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the contrary of what I have said.
For what I didn't say it was you who gave me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany anything in fact you didn't answer what I said and like all right-wing people demolishing the interlocutor I never do.
I would also like to quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an unprofitable and inefficient way of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you do not count uranium extraction and construction and if you do not count water vapour greenhouse gases of lesser effect than Co2 it is true recall two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant goes into water vapour and a bit into the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a "South Asian giant"...!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I'm not surprised, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India a South Asian giant...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would just open a Pandora's box full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening game was surprisingly interesting, with Kolkata's Athletico winning 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India spends on the IPL cricket and now on football, how could we ever compete with our "noisy neighbors"...
The low cost launcher race pays cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect can only occur with a helium that is too cold.
So maybe we're not in a design flaw, but implementation...
Unlike Arianespace, which is a private company, it seems that soyouz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they'll pay for the satellites in frigates who knows..
This is all the more unfortunate given that many media re-enact only the titles of articles - and that many readers retain only these titles .
In total this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Quite agreed with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly calls into question the project when it is only a launcher problem.
