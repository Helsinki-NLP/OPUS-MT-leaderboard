The tour industry is showing its highly pollutedness
Sydney is the Sydney Harbour Bridge, surrounded by the largest commercial port, Orecan, Lantau Park, and symbol - symbol harbor in the Australian economy each year.
But below the bridge is a sheer truth.
One of the most unclean waterways in Sydney’s famous harbor country is the pollution levels of 15 Olympic sports pools each year.
This alarming statistics make this area one of the most appealing places to tourists, one of our most uncleanst places.
According to a new film named Sydney Harbor and under, it becomes through the water of the most famous city of Australia, with plastics, plastic bags, plastic bags, broken shoes, and dead animals filling up the harbor.
But blocking our passageways is the greatest part of plastic.
On the other hand, on the other hand, September 27 of the World’s tourism, Dr.
It looks beautiful, but it is one of the most altered and unclean deltas on our beaches.
Every hour, some 150 pounds [1560 kg] of plastic - measuring plastic ways flow into the ports, most of which come into the harbor through the water drains.
"After some of the events that were raining on a very large scale, this harbor is in serious danger."
A third of these unclean ones are leaking through the raindrops.
But when 70 percent of all plastics inside the ocean reach the ocean, the problem of Sydney Harbour is huge, below the surface, as if a iceberg.
Richard Nichols, owner of the Maine Center of Man and His Team, says that he and his team put their plastic in a separate way each year and say, "You can really know what is there at the bottom only if you go to the bottom and spend time under it."
If this becomes known to more, what will they be shocked?
There's a great deal... every one of them we've got to find is about half plastic bags.
The remaining 50 percent are made of plastic.
As you look at the harbor, it looks pretty but just below its surface, people will not believe that all of this plastic and garbage is all there is.
Osman also said that both local and tourists live together according to the same means as both local and tourists to reduce the amount of plastic and garbage that leads to our waterways.
He said, "It must start with an original one."
We need to reduce the size of the plastic we use and improve well, and we must be more alert to that, when we drive into our tanks, that is, floating in the sea.
When we ruin the sea, we are destroying ourselves because 50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean.
It contains 30 percent carbon dioxide and food evidence.
But we can correct this port and bring it back to its original state, which is very easy.
We are destroying ourselves if we destroy the sea.

Concern for plastics coming into the sea is increasing, and a study showed that 93 percent of the 551 parents surveyed said that they had been told by their parents that they were getting a third of what their parents were concerned about.
“ We want to do something about plastic waste, but many in the study said that we don’t know how to make the difference, which is causing the pollution of our environment.

Tasmania’s microbes can lead to a cure for cancer
Researchers have discovered a turning point in the treatment of sickle - cell anemia.
Medical researchers found how certain cancer cells hide themselves
Researchers found that the same process was being done for Tasmanians and humans
This discovery is expected to provide new methods for treating cancer patients
What is common among Tasmania’s demographers and humans?
You may be surprised to learn that cancer cells are highly sensitive to the immune system.
Researchers, including researchers who came from Melbourne’s Peter McGill center, have established a program that would help in treatment if certain types of cancers did not respond to the immune system.
It may be an important factor in improving dangerous facial markings that threaten the future of Tasmania’s extinct Tasmanian desensitization.
This study found the way some cells in humans and that with a group of cystic2 proteins hide themselves and do not act as a signal warning signal against cancer of the immune system, that is, to humans and animals.
This may be a major challenge in treating small - cell lung cancer, the form of oral cancer, and the type of ergonomic cancer called pertussis.
‘ At times, ’ said Peter Max Dysson, chief of the program, ‘ we can do the same to patients who oppose the treatment.
The immune system can detect cancer cells by changing the function of specific enzymes, antigens, and antigens to the present function of present treatments.
‘ It’s possible for those with cancer cancer to have long - term benefits, ’ said Professor Dosen.
‘ This is one of the most infectious diseases around the world.
We can treat it in a better way.
Researchers also believe that the discovery could eventually be applied to the facial tumors of the Tasmanian descientists that try to prevent cancer cells from being detected.
The same technique is remarkable for humans (and for cancer in Tasmania’s Columbia University), Professor Dosen said.
Until that time it was very difficult to treat cancer tumors in Tasmania.
But it is possible to help control the disease if people can use drugs to help people in Tasmania.

Scientists are puzzled about orbiting the largest planetary
Scientists have been amazed at the discovery of a solar family in 30 years of light from the earth, which is a challenge for the development of planetary planets, such as Jupiter.
Written on September 26, 2019, the largest gaseous gas orbits around Redburn, Redburn, is 3512 p.m.
The stars are usually larger than the largest planets that surround them.
But researchers on Thursday said that there was no major difference in the size of the star and planet.
That star, Mesha, is 3512. While the star, which is about 12 percent in size, will be at least half the size of our planetary family on Jupiter’s largest planet.
The head of a research study published in the science magazine Nature, as reported in the Associated Press, said: “Astronomers at the Interdiscovering Space Telescope Institute in the Netherlands said, this is a very surprising thing, yes.
This discovery was amazing in the fact that small planets, such as the earth and the smaller planets, usually contain small planets.
In it we have discovered that the largest gas satellite similar to Jupiter is coming around a small star, ” added Dores.
This planet, made up of gas like Jupiter, was used by the lethargic Observatory in Spain by means of a telescope.
It moves its star, which lasts 204 days, in its orbits.
The red - and - black black - and - white color has a small and low - surface temperature.
Jeanny 3512 is not only too small for our sun but also for a relatively large planet, which is about 35% larger than Thursday.
With their low energy exposure, their surface temperature is below the sun, and their surface temperature is approximately 3880 degrees Fahrenheit (680 ° C).
This is why Mores said they have the red color.
While the second planet is on its orbit, the third planet may have been moved from the family of stars in the past, explains the orbits of that planet, such as Jupiter.
Scientists have discovered that the earth’s orbits, including the earth’s orbits, are composed of dust and dust from the same layer of gas and dust that they hope to create.
The chief model for the planet, which is called "central growth", produces at first a solid dust from the layer, which produces a atmosphere that is \t\t\tining from the atmosphere around the core.
This unusual structure may be described as an extremely unstable, unstable structure.
He said: "In this event, the prottosterum around the lower age of the starry mass may be much bigger than what was expected, and rather cold than what was."
This causes the layer to be unstable, resulting in some dense areas.
These piles of sand can grow until they are broken down, and a planet is formed.
It is a big issue in the issue of an edict issued by the High Court of Justice to allow sheep to be slaughtered in temples in Mesopotamia to be sacrificed.

An appeal against Australia
Justin D.
The Australian team won the game, making them the most likely team to win at T-R.
But if the Australian team won the British gold team 14 times their last 15 visits, it would push the team to the limit for the last eight destinations in England.
"There's nothing to hide, both teams will win, always try to hold the first place in the section."
Some results were difficult in the past, but a victory against them in the last autumn (Apprecial) was worth it.
I think they will be active in our idea of conquering us again, and we want to make sure that another victory is achieved.
We knew that this was an important competition before it was coming here.
Now we have come here, and the time really has come for us to show skill.
In the history of world history, the Welsh team had only one victory against Australian, New Zealand, or South America — a victory when it won the Australians a third race of three years ago.
Altogether, there have been only 7 hits in 41 of every three global moons under the U.S. Supreme Train Board.

You need to confront the world’s greatest soldiers rather than run away from them after they play properly.
If you would like to play against the best athletes, and if you play against these two players, you must be an excellent player.
I wouldn’t say that the Sunday meeting was the last, but this was a major competition for us in this world.
The most important part of the shoe is the wearing of shoes.

The white palace is struggling to find out where it is located by the footpath 'full panic '
In deciding how to react to the renewed efforts of democratic Party members on Thursday, a man who had no solution for this new problem explained that last week the situation was ‘ full panic coming. ’

He said, "There's an unlikely environment where there's nothing."
There are officers of the White House who do not know what to do, but not because there is no outright plan for the situation but because it is not used by the majority of the churches in the past: "This seems to be a matter of time, when the next news begins to disappear."
Knowing of these suggestions, another person in the White House newspaper said that if this position was said to be shaken, the position would be shaken, and if the trial continued, he would be concerned that there would be an increase in the possibility of ‘ unintelligible ’ move.
While stress is expected to increase daily on the trial day, he also expressed the same concern that some people around the top of the body would expect to be treated and treated with ‘ emotional ’ behavior.

Moreover, the fact that he became a member of the greatest siege continues to move his true believers to protect him.

"There is no advantage in focusing on the positions of the highest rank for the next four months, especially when it covered his legal conferences and carried the headlines.
Some argue that it is not possible for those who claim to help out for higher office to know exactly what his answer would be.

But for such an effort, my BBC News said that he really did not take the lead.
He said, “I have done everything I could for the past five years to support and his project, but I did not take any advice from a team, to try to steal a false position, to try it.”

At this point, journalists interviewed by the National Socialist leader of the U.S.
Thank you for the case of me in this case when I am not a banker or a long - term banker.
I don’t think I should be surprised at this activity.
I would often be outside the courtroom for Congress propaganda.
So I should not be misunderstood by the Australasians to be in hiding.
I'm going to the office office to the Friday (Nisan Day) office.
And I will give them the information they want.
Their right to investigate the case.
I was the one who believed the charter of the Constitution.
So I would provide full cooperation for the hearing.
In the Middle East, for example, it is used as a symbol of power, power, and power.
We did not know who we were going to be before the throne.

A potentially potentially potentially harmful biological process can help reduce the output of smoke
It seems that during recent years, airplanes have not been able to fly beyond renewed energy limit, while gas cars and desalination headlines keep moving into headlines:
But a professor of Aberda University has developed a technology that can lead to the use of renewable biological fuel as fuel.
During 2003, Desererseror, professor of agriculture, biology, and environmental science at the University of Almata, began this program.
He has also developed a hydrocarbon fuel from waste, such as food oil, animals, and Canada’s oil.
This technology can be used in its production, unlike fuel and other life - saving fuels, allowing carbon - based fuels to reduce carbon - based output, allowing it to reduce carbon - based output, and allow it to operate when it comes to waste from other factories.
The technology works to make the hydrocarbons in fuel - based fuel.
He said: "The technology made first generation of us, and it is for creating the same hydrocarbons in Texas as the molecules in Texas."
This, in turn, provides a new choice for life - fuel use, will lose stability in previous biological fuels at low levels and cause the serious problem of flying.
He said: "The problem with fuel is like Kate-22, which has no way out."
In fact, its value is smaller than tea, but its need is greater.
Now two choices are being made to produce life - sustaining fuel for the U.S.
The first option is that their hydrocarbons perform another process of burning gas and localize hydrogen, low - risk approach.
The second option is to continue working at a very low - cost chemical plant, which will keep fuel stable even in low temperatures.
He said, "We can play games with some of the chemicals on the Richter scale."
In addition, there is a high rate of risk.
With both airlines and Canada and American military forces making major investments for a renewable choice, For FortDR, an auxiliary University University - based radios are operating in this way.
He said, "It may be that someone in the future will tax them with carbon tax."
They expect a change at that point.
Ford recently obtained US4 million money from La Paz, near the port of Edwardton’s Waste Management Center.
The mill is expected to produce 19 million gallons of life - sustaining fuel each year.
Overdrafter points out that although carbon output will be reduced by 85 percent, such factors as fuel transport and production are the reasons why carbon output will not be diminished.
"A professional person,
He said that the choice of choices will be the result of information being made and the development of a variety of opportunities to choose.

Second vote will change the real outcome, but one senior minister said that in the country, there is a danger of a rise in people’s lives.
The senior Ministers warned the prime minister’s seniors that the peace of the country was so deep in the Old Lasle Streets and that in France there was no economic inequality at all.
Mr. Jackson said in political language about this angry conflict: “Abstinence is to lose its temper, ” but he insisted that they would not stop using the word ‘ surrender ’ in order to prevent this conflict.
Although he requested peace, he said to the Times Times Magazine: "In this country, we have never seen Kamps [Lile’s shirt] or the battle of Los Angeless [1992].
People did not realize that it was possible for this country to be the cause of pre - Flood events.
Now they have an example of a yellow shirt struggle, a modern telephone, and only two prominent leaders who promote it.
Following the release of four white guard officers in Los Angeles, the Black Auto - driver was attacked by the black - driver Rotari King in a case of having been beaten by four white men.
Early this year, the well - known yellow shirts, which were well - looked, were wiped out on the streets of Paris for more than six weeks with French revolutions against the government’s government.
The minister pointed out that if Britain failed to leave from one European country, “the confidence of our political system would be much more destructive ” because Mr.
The minister said that if 66 percent of us fail to vote in a poll of 30 million people, ten million are still satisfied.
Although 99 percent of them are actually angry, another 100,000 are really angry, writing to their Parliament members and prevent it.
There would be no need to large, and soon thousands of people would be on the streets.
A second poll followed, and in the United States, one of the senior firms said that there is “a serious rise in people’s lives. ”
Mr. Jackson has called for to conduct a public debate with the Prosthetics.
He is said to be faced with the excitement of ministers who cut down his approval and instead make a reconciliation with a European.
Pakistan’s Social Media — ‘ Killing ’ The brother who ‘ killed ’ was sentenced to life imprisonment
Females claim that crimes are released in the network as often as they are not committed and that crimes are often being committed in strict justice, as crimes are sometimes being committed.

Summer rains have caused floods and confusion in many parts of India
Nearly a month has passed, and because of this rain that has not been seen, the lives of many crops have begun to dry up.
Usually September will begin to fall down early in northern India, but this month the average rainfall for this month dropped 37% more than the average rainfall rate.
According to the Indian Institute of Weather Research, if the same rate continues in some remaining days, this will be the case during the last few decades.
Recently, rain has poured into many parts of the country, and the city of Faulna, in the western part of India, has brought rain on Wednesday and Thursday, where torrential rains have caused many deaths, and buildings to collapse.

Although the bus stop and the hospital is near, it is stopped before the entrance is closed.
The noise that sounds like a sound is a sound.
The sound of the bus driver’s seat for lack of sleep.
Additionally, private ambulances are stuck at the entrance of the State Hospital.
As a result, there is no time - consuming traffic in front of the hospital.

The minister of State R. B.
The southwest spring rains are encountered in other states, notably in the Northern Hemisphere.
Since October of the northeastern autumn, the rainy season lasts for three months.
The low air pressure produced during this time of the winter may weaken the pressure and cause the shore to pass into storms.
In view of the effects of the storms in the past, the climate is ripe for encountering northeastern rains at the top of the year.
It is estimated that 4,393 areas are in danger of damage.
In it up to 5 feet [5 m] of water are brought into the most dangerous category.
Storm results in 12 coastal districts in the state.
These districts have 121 significant centers to store public security.
Besides these, it is emphasized to have wedding rooms, schools, and communities ready in other districts.
For the rescue efforts, $14.4 million has been set aside.
And these districts are on the verge of rescue forces ready.
A fisherman did not die during the Gujar storm because of the government’s caution action.
Instead, the wall collapsed, and electricity and loss of lives took place.

National Geographic magazine reported that farmers may profit greatly by choosing the fast - growing commercial fish they will grow.
He stated:
If farmers raise gene - growing fish to a higher degree and develop fast - growing fish over other fish, the farmers of farm shorts may find that gene - resistant fish can be useful more quickly than other fish.
The cane fish can grow more and more in size than other fish.
They are more immune to disease than other fish.
And it is the kind of fish that the consumer likes.
So farmers are asked to make more effective use of gene - improved fish on their farms.
At the same time, however, it is possible for the young of Tsirli’s fish to be sold throughout the year on a government fishing farm near Kyrgyz.
In some areas, farmers may be able to buy these products at least once a year, and they may be useful to farmers.
The farmers who raise these fish should look at their fish farm as a protective barrier around their fishing area and not spread it in nearby waters.
The Connan district fish farmers must record fish farm in the development camp and then raise fish in their farms.
And for further details, the office of fishing director may also know whether the East Coast is the Neuro language, or 044-24499, telephone.
The human bones in the bottom are programmed to experiment with DNA.
According to The Economist, DNA tests the ancient human bones of ancient men who were dug out ofneum, keratin, and nephroscopes of Tamil, have been linked to the connection between the treatment of the foundologian University and the Harvard Medical School.
Archaeology's chief secretary and secretary Timing said:
In the field of archaeological research, the Guinness Book of Music and Research will be signed jointly by David Reims of the University of Harvard School of Medicine.
We believe that we will find more than ten times the human bones in our future excavations, where we will find more than ten times as long as we gather, in the Orient, and in the Orient.
These samples will be sent to the DNA analysis.
This will reveal primarily what kind of gene was found in the human bones that were dug in the Tamil text.
Overuse of pesticides can lead to heart disease and stroke.
According to one new study, working with high levels of pesticides may result in heart disease.
The situation was on the team of Japanese Americans in Hawaii, followed by three stickers.
Researchers found that most people most likely had a high level of risk of heart disease or stroke compared with those who did not work with pesticides.
In the study, Dr. Rodrigues Rodrigues said that this study underscores the importance of using antipollution devices when it comes to pesticides and to controlling the risk of heart disease due to work.
He is professor of nursing at the University of Hawaii, in the University of Hawaii.
These findings have been found from data collected by over 6,000 people in O’Hu, who share in the loving program.
Researchers noted that these findings did not fit women or other people, since only males of the Japanese tribe shared.
Since pesticides have long - term effects, their effects on health may appear several years later.
Within 10 years of this phenomenon, there were maximum effects.
‘ After 34 years of following those people, there was no communication between pesticides and heart disease and stroke, ’ said Rhodes in a news issue.
Since other factors associated with age are involved, there is likely to be possible communication between pesticides and heart disease in later life.
Researchers discovered that there is no significant link between low - intensity pesticides and heart disease.

Elizabeth I’s lost garment is displayed in court palace with Hampey
It is made up of the best - kept dishes, made of silver tabs, and has been fitted in a beautiful way with plants, animals, and butterflies.
It only tells of the gathering of clothes in historic royal courts.
A 100 - year - old man, sitting on the wall of a small rural village temple, could be the only piece he saw and a piece of cloth missing from Elizabeth I’d wear.
Three years after Lynn’s painting of the luxury dress at the temple in Basel, three years later, the queen of England, along with Elizabeth in the same room where she held it, Elizabeth in the hospital, was placed.
The only thing that is still one of the 16th - century fabrics of the royal package is to tell the importance of the invention.
A three - year research into the idea that the dress may have been a part of the royal family’s dress when there were no valid evidence that the dress was once worn by Elizabeth.
The expensive price of "golden cloth" is also a legal symbol for members of the royal family, and Mikhalh is a "proportionately ” ability, adds deer, dogs, butterflies, and fish, and a high level of bear.
When it was formed, it could have a corresponding value for the operator.
Moreover, in the late 1950 ’ s, in the late 1950 ’ s, other women in the royal court would not have accepted such a fine dress by his enemies as they grew up competing with him.
It was a big matter, so many colleagues came and looked at it.
While looking at it, they were amazed to see that their seeing at the arrival was just one of the royal family’s dress styles.
With a second long life in the garment, it could not be viewed as an unexpected arrival for the use of the St.
Brenton, the village of Blanton’s native village of Bachtham, has long linked his services to the birth of a queen of queen, Elizabeth’s extended life.
Although the dress is still in his late teens in 1590, experts believe that it may have been given to theigraphine family, or the Barsch, to commemorate his death before Elizabeth 1603.
After more than 1000 hours of preservation, more than 400 of them were placed in specialized dyes with fine silk and fine surgery.
"When you work with some of the most expensive clothes, it really happens to be respect for the designers," says Lisa Thompson, who headed the security department for the security department, most of its protection in the Holy Office at the Holy See.

It was in this condition that the old photo and image of a student at the ESG Medical College was revealed to be different from the old photograph and image of a student.
This was followed by a hearing in the medical profession.
In an interview with medical director of the Medical College at Cheyenne today, nora bachelor of the Red Cross, there was a discussion of this:
In 23 percent, we reported having two students photographing some of their photographs.
Following this, we built a panel of 5 responsive individuals.
We were interrogated by two students and their parents.
We also compared their certificates to documents with your choice Hallet ticket and identity card.
As a result of this study, it is obvious that none of the students are fakes.
In spite of a slight difference in photographs, there is a similar problem.
So the minister of health ordered the next year to bring me to the student’s routine.

It was a photo in school.
Now I've corrected hair.
It's not that right now.
For this reason, I was brought up as a checker.
The problem is that the hair has just disappeared, and there is no more problem with it.
The image is different from the old photo, which is now available in many parts of the world.

The Guadalupe Internet — The Scientific Day Association
The end of a U.S. military research has brought the web close one step closer.
Such a Web can provide the military with potential security, safety, and timing of regular network visits.
The Center for Gumidal Information, which has been distributed by the U.S. Army Medical Research Center of May, saw a university record of over 50 miles [50 km] between funding and management by the military research office of the project, which served as a basis for the use of a 50 - mile [50 km] - km [50 - km] microbiography cable.
One group that can be developed between quadrillics, such as nephroscopes, is a middle line.
The connection between two plates is formed, and if one is measured, the result of the size of the other, even if the second element is very distant.
"It's a far cry from the size of two orders [50 kilometers] earlier than possible, and the distance between the cities," said researchers at the University of Inströmology and Physiology at the University of Washington, U.S.A., have been published.
Gum networks between cities are built by far the distance from the Indian velds, even though they are too far away.
The researchers said that the fraction distribution is essential to the establishment of the Guarani Internet.
“ This is a major step forward, which will make the distribution possible on large scale, ” said Sara Campele, cosmologist.
The value of the fraction at the other end of the journey is high for some hard - and - fast network applications.

Using laser - beamers, researchers at the University of California, U.S.A., while raising quaysic state on acetaminogen, triggered a collection of Guadalupe data.
As a result, the quantums of the nuclear and the light - years were obscurity.
It is a challenge to send Phybera through the light - sensitive cables.
He said, "The channel of Physiology is about 854 centimeters [54 m] in diameter, which is soon absorbed by the fibrinogen.
His team, therefore, sent light down through the thickly lit tube, which was passed through the granaries of light.
The mill’s channel was changed to a long distance of 1550 feet [1550 m].
Later, researchers sent the trace via a 30 - mile [50 km] Berquist cable.
Even after channel change and a long journey, the measurements showed that the atom and light particles were still in the background.
These findings offer direct guidance on the likelihood of a long - distance network of atomic clocks, since the ability to use calcium can be dangerous.
In large - scale clock networks, says Dr.
