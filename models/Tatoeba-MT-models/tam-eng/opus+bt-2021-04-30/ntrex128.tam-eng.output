Welsh AM's worried about 'assin'
The MWPs are a mess among some of their theme members that they have to be transferred to the MWPs (Roland Parliament members).
This is due to the projects that shift the name of the law to the Welsh taper.
It was worried that the nudes throughout the political domains could call this a joke.
A Laber's AM said it was "scorp and Bwwbling with it", and his team said it was worried.
To readers without Wales: If twwk is stupid and pwbp is bap.
The co-founder also announced that alternative ways were "not happy" and that a bubonic AM was required.
A Welsh footballer has said his team "with a mind of the change of name", but this has expressed a minor problem for MWP from MWP.
In this environment we are pronounced like the spelling W W W, as a spelling of the English pronunciation.
The New York Times stated that the current law of making and introducing changes is: How the Court members are invited at the end of any interpretation of the name is sure to have their opinion of members.
The Wales government ruled 2017, giving the authority to change its name to the Welsh Constitution.
In June, it was issued by the Department of Public Counsel regarding recommendations, which was the support of most of the support to call the Constitutional Parliament.
In the theme of the AM's, the order was supported by the Welsh Parliament members, or the WWPPP, but received more support in the public's public advice.
AMs also recommend general alternative options, but the fight to achieve a peaceful opinion may be a problem for the chief officer Elisabeth Jonson, who is expected to be able to submit the draft law regarding changes within a few weeks.
In the law of the Reformation, the rules of qualifying for theAMMs and the system's rules include other changes regarding the way the parliament works.
The final vote will be reached for the question of how they should be called in the decision of law.

St. Martin Temple's bells fell in the Battle of Harlem.
Previously, when I spoke with adults at the age of ten, Mr. Adams said that there was a bar and temple for each corner.
Today, nothing.
He said that the bars would be lost.
He said that people are getting together in a different way now.
Looks will no longer exist, and people will not be roomed on the side of the neighborhood.
As for temples, he is concerned that the money available will not last until the leaders sell property, and he is concerned that they will "go back to where they have begun."
He said that buildings made of people who did not help in the theaters at the top were coming to the temples.
Those who buy the most separate apartments in these buildings are white people, "The temple will be closed altogether, because the purchasers will be members of the temple's temples."
Two temples built before Harlem, built in front of the Whites, have been built to the blacks – McLean Social, 1870, after the Holy Martin.

Ferguson's son and successor to Saint Martin, David Johnson, proudly called Karen "the bells of the poor people."
The scholar who read the Caribbean in July also called it a cultural treasure and called it "the unrecorded historical tool".
This was noted by the expert at the University of Michigan's Democratic Association, who noted that a black musician who moved to the Great Caribbean temple 18 years ago was the first of the world to read.
Mr. Martins said Mr. Merrider did not agree with him.
During the last few months, the movement in St. Martin was a complex story for some architecture and alliances brought by the Chiefs of the Temple and the Chiefs of the House of God.
The members of the West Indies - State control organization wrote that even though the architects and alliances sent to the Secreta in July and in July, even though they did not participate in their mission, the West Indies expected to be "inducted by the Ottomans".
Some church members complained that it would not be clear of the fact that the matter was not openly exposed on the part of the Secret.

It's very big, but I'm running, though I'm running, because I'm fighting for "the Great Wikinews"," he said.
"You see the Democratic Committee on the Democratic Party that looks like it's going to happen, and the Trump continued.
They look back to their positions using something, and see the bad behavior.
They do not know who we are, who we are, to receive power. They have no authority to give them it."
Speaking of Democracy, he says that "to forget and forget."
He says that over the past four days he has said of the democratics who are "miserable, unfaithful, and bad."
One thing that was received from visitors was the debut of the Deputy of the Democratic Committee of the Squadron.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you released the document?
Wow. What.
No. It's really bad physical language. It's the worst body I've ever seen."
It is no longer an organization with a wide range of ideas.
They cannot be patient with the person they have in their heart.
To condemn me, the activists in my party promised that this was really surprising.
I am the only person in the Laberberg MP for hearing that we did not want to talk to us about what they were saying in their hearts.
It was held like this for giving a voice against racial discrimination against the Jewish people.
I was condemned for having mixed opinion with Jeremy Carter.

But there's no sound like this today, and that's not what it's like today, and that's how it's just started, and that's just as long as the mild political was a long forgotten.
It is possible to feel that we can't be able to tolerate the views of the Laberburg party. Every idea is resolved by the leadership of the party.
Jeremy, this came shortly after the head leader, and I had shared similar political ideas with those I did not like, and they never agreed with me that I did not want to take the positions I did.
No matter when I speak in general, what I'm talking about is not the main thing they are talking about - because I'm condemned in the social media for the lack of discipline, and the protests that I would not even be within the political party.
Also, it's not just my experience.
In fact, I think it is a privilege to be in the public so that I can think of the condemnations made on my behalf compared to those of those who work with me.
I am amazed at those who work with me. Daily, though they face disgraces as a result of sexual and gender, they don't have to be so strong and the technology-based system.
One of the worst aspects of this period of politics is that it is very common for a person to be defunct.
In the last week, Jeremy Carrie said that the party was supposed to develop the culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we will no longer have a wide range of ideas because of the change in the party due to a change in the election or because of a change in the election.
I have received numerous advice that if I have felt that my head should remain in the middle of the last two years and that I should not say anything about this, the problems I have had to be solved have been solved.
But for this I did not come to politics.
I decided that since the track's rejection of the royal court resulted in the collapse of the school's classroom, 32 years ago I would be in the school's party as a member of the local Council of State or as the best service for the people who were required to become the minister of the local council.
I do not hide my politics, including the last elections.
No one on the east side of my political policy is confused about the Yangham East but they don't agree with them about the current leadership.
I don't understand that if I am going to make decisions on Friday's course, families, businesses and public services will be affected by our public service, and I don't realize that it would be futile to reveal the faith and strength of the party's leader.
My group is not the only group that gives me a message that I can give to the people of the country, whether they are members or members of the Legislative Party: I am convinced that my service to you will not continue to be a threat or a threat to the political environment.

John Edward: Language needs to be done for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools are constantly showing the best education for the best, with the game, music, music, and other social activities, along with the 2018-18 Best School Education Results.
With 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, which are presented by the Scottish Scottish School of Free Schools, offer the best service for students and their parents.
In addition to making their students the best educational preparations, the independent schools allow them to create and transform them into global citizens.
When creating a school design and practical application, new languages become popular with the schools and become a favorite choice.
Nelson Thompson stated: “If man speaks to him in the language that man can understand, it gets his understanding.
It is his heart to speak in his own language.
It is a powerful reminder that it cannot be relied upon to establish relationships from other countries and to gain and trust English alone.
From the results of this year's election, we can see that language levels are the highest in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who have studied foreign languages have the highest Greg A.
According to data derived from the SCIS- 74 members of schools, 72 percent of the students in May have high-level AAA and 72 percent of the German language students, and 69 percent of French-language students, and 63% of Spanish-language students are educated.
This suggests that Scotland's independent schools teach the primary language skills of foreign languages that are necessary for children and young adults.
In schools with independent school projects, it can be found that the learning of knowledge, technology, engineering, and mathematics is the main choice.
In the 2014 UK Commission conducted by the UK Commission, those who fill up emptys suggest that language levels are caused by a 17 percent reduction.
As a result, it is very important for young people to have their language skills in future industrials.
The languageization is crucial for the best professional opportunities required by languages.
It will be the ability to help all of us to learn a second language, regardless of the choice of any profession.
The ability to communicate directly with people from abroad will automatically lead one to succeed in winning one’s knowledge of many languages.
According to a 2013 survey of 4000 UK youths in 2013, 75 percent of the people could not speak foreign language spoken by people, and 15 percent could only speak French.
This is why the investment of language learning is important for children of today.
With many languages, this method will prepare children to receive meaningful work.
Within Scotland, each school differs from that of which they teach.
For many schools to have a sense of learning new languages, it is a desire to teach languages mainly in the 2020s, such as the Japanese language.
Regardless of your children's wishes, there will be a lot of languages and teachers in the Department of Freedom Schools.
Scotland's independent schools provide a subsidiary for the skills and the ability to help him in the future.
The development of the country, and the global trade environment, is not to be confused with the fact that language is important, so it must reflect education.
Also, modern languages should be considered "International Communication Force".
Free Schools will provide this opportunity for the younger members of Scotland, and will provide them with an opportunity to become a member of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization.
I'm going to get a touchdown.

"There's no way of saying there's a lack of hope," says North Carolina.
The United Nations Department of Public Affairs, held in North Korea, said that continuing economic restrictions on the United States would cut off his confidence in the United States and that the country would not have any other way to compromise its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
During the last year, he announced that North Korea, North Korea, nuclear and nuclear testing tests, had failed to "advert good intentions", such as the assurance that nuclear weapons and nuclear technology would not increase nuclear technology.
He said, "Heaven and we didn't get any answer from America."
"We can't trust in their national security without any belief in America, and in similar situations we have no way of using weapons, unless we first use weapons."
To prevent nuclear weapons from being suspended for the "productive" approach, it may be that it has taken progressive measures (which are significant here) and that it is generally considered to be the same as the previous report of Vassey's protests about it, as it was seen in his past, that it was not a nuclear bomb that had been suspended in the past.
At the first summit, which was held in Singapore on 12 June, Kim Jong and Donald Trump stated that a joint report on the arrival of the United States President and the United States to protect you, was assured that "the efforts needed to take advantage of the Wikinews will be underway to the North Korean security of North Korea."

"It is the day of people who are not aware of us who are not aware of it."
But the problem is that the ongoing economic barriers increase our distrust."
Rid was not referring to any plan for the summit for any summit for the U.S. Secretary of the United Nations on the beginning of the week.
In instead of that, the minister of three talks between Kim and the South Korean leader Mullon Jinnie in the last five months further stated that "the reason why America is not the cause of losing these nuclear weapons is not the reason why the South Korea has not been able to abandon the nuclear weapons."
The president of the Metropolitan E. Trump, who later said that the Gibbb suicide attack was "the man of the story", had been the same as the voice of the American congregation in North Korea when it stated that one of the UK's rockets in North Korea's Mechanical County was unable to distinguish the last year from the previous year.
The gunman who threatened North Korea for the last year said that the last year, "I'm going to destroy the North Korea", praised the courage of the United Nations to take up arms in this year, but that North Korea would still have to be under ban as much as the economic restrictions were being made.
Wednesday said that there were no toilets for this period and that "this two years, three or five months, and five months, there was no problem in it."
China and Russia report that the United Nations Security Council should provide a safe congregation reward for the action taken by Pongangang.

In July, Pittt left Bang, saying that the action had been taken for hours before the arrival of North Korea.

What is it about the Globe City Ferguson (the global citizen Mr. Stamp) that has done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the annual Globe and Mail concert is walking in New York City, with the band's parade of stars on the show, and the work of bringing an increase in global poverty is taking place.
It is now the seventh year for the Globe City Championship, where not only will you be able to see the events of people's crisis of poverty, but you can see that the real purpose of ending poverty in the 2030s is to see millions of people flock to the park to enjoy the real purpose of an end of poverty.
The Globe City, quoted in 2012, has become the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and by increasing the number of people fighting against poverty, the International Committee for the Ending of Poverty (World Health Organization) is the expansion of the world's poverty program.
To get the free entry for the event (if you are not ready to pay for a VB ticket), the candidates must complete a series of tasks or "advertisements" in order to complete the call, in order to achieve a world-subduction call, to achieve a world-surrection invitation, or to end poverty.
But how successful is it is in the remaining 12 years to reach his goal by the Globe City Championship?
The idea to give people a free-permanent gift is to give them an honest way to ask people to engage in activity, or in another case the application is "to use the media" by signing or sending an application into a web-out-out-out-outer-out-in-sight, or by sending a real change in people's response to a non-profit solution.
Since 2011, the Globe City has recorded more than 19 millenarians who insist on having different goals from their supporters.
It says that these measures helped the world leaders to announce more than $37 billion worth of credit and policies, set up by 2.25 billion people in the 2030s.
In the early 2018 season, the group quoted 390 predictions and statements from his activities, at least $10 billion of which were already shared or collected.
The team estimates that protected financial resources have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
In some of the key assurances, the U.S. Interdisciplinary Foundation of the Year, and the Awards of the Awards, the project also ensures that "the children's ability to develop their full potential, so that they will be able to provide more than 4 million dollars for the country's health, and that it will bring about a reduction of $3 million in the country's poverty.

After more than 5,000 measures were taken to improve the nutritional value of mothers and children, the government announced a plan to fund a program of five million women and children to achieve nutrition interventions.

The Globe City responded: "It's a long and difficult road that we're going to fail to be a long and hard path.
However, just as the large civil rights and anti-government movements in front of us can be won, because we are more powerful than one.
Jr. Jackson, Jr., and Zhemberg, as well as Carvets, Carter, Carter P, and John Sidney Movie Movie, are the stagekeeper for the event.

However, we have continued to try it.
Believe me, when the event was changed, there were many text clips, and they weren't good enough.
We tried to fix it, and we thought it was a technical disorder.
But it's not the technology disorder, it's related to the government's related problem.
I promise you that the next time this will never happen.
Instead of the six conflicts, we usually tried to provide more of our votes to the fans, and we increased the number of conflicts.
This is an unexpected event."
Twitter Discs: Tom Tom Dobine realized that it's not his own.
Tom Tom, a Olympic football player, said that he had grown down and felt down by himself, and that the same time has encouraged me to win.
The 24-year-old player later informed me that he was learning that he was not like me.
When Leeder was speaking at the first radio debuted 4 Twitter Disc in the disc, the player spoke about the male rights to give others "the hope".
It has also said that at least one parent will reduce interest in winning the Olympic competition.
The long-time broadcaster Gibbby Young, who has been in prison for a few months because of poor health, has been able to use the program for a number of months.
In his first episode of Leerre, he said that as he grew up, "men thought that women were interested in men and that women were not being accepted in the social level."
He also said: “Today, I have less than a measure of evaluation, feelings and a different sense of reality, and they give me the energy and energy to win me."
He said that he wanted to prove that he had "the ability to understand" so that it didn't hurt him when others found out about his sexual nature.
The bronze medal won the match twice in the Olympics, and the popularity of the LGBT's active campaign in support of the United Nations, was used to announce that more countries were required to report their involvement in the Year's Olympic Games, as well as to show that homosexuality is not justified.
He said that even if I felt that I could live without fear and that I could be able to live without anything, I would say his ideas are in general, even if I wanted to give to others "the hope."
He said that the American film director had fallen in love with the Black's Black Woman, and met him in the 2013 season, and said that the player won three World Championships "with love with the look".
She was married to a 20-year-old-year-old Oscar, who had won him over the last year, and said that he had never been a different person.
"When You've been through a lot of weight and downs", he took the lead in the Olympics for the first time in his 14-year competition, and later he said that his father's father had died of cancer and that he would be hard to find someone who had met similar high points and who had met up with such high standings and matches.
The pair became parents of June in June, and they named their male child Robert Rainey-Chinese, who then said that he had changed his "full perspective" and that he had changed his "full perspective".
"If you had asked me the last year, I would have said 'I'd be the only thing to win the gold medal."
"You know, there are more things than Olympic gold medals.
Rambie is my Olympic gold medal medal".
He was the son of his father, Robert's father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Since his father did not believe he was going to die and the 2012 London Olympics competed in the first row, he received tickets and shared one of the last things he heard.
He said, "I can't tell him that you're not going to sit in the first row to see Dad.", he said.
"When he stopped his last breath, I was holding his hand, not only until he was actually standing his last breath, but he was holding his hand, and finally I realized that we couldn't finally overcome death," he said.
Dasa competed in the 2012 Olympics after Father's death and won the bronze medal.
"I have a dream in which I have a dream in the mass life," he said, "that's what I want to hit before the local fan crowd in the Olympics, and there's no greater happiness than it."
He said the first song that encouraged him to be the first song to this end — the song encouraged him during the games of the song and said that he was still saying that the grass would be sweet.
The BBC Radio is the debut of the debuted disc on the Twitter Discs, Sunday, 11:15 BST.
On Saturday Rugby did not play in Fortston's game match
While playing with her 47th-century game on Sunday, American player Billingson's achievement in the game was to be returned to his Ford if he had to change this achievement to a happy achievement.
During the last two years playing in the game, he had an achievement to play 12 times, and Captain Jim Fletcher did not take part in the tournament of the Saturdays and Fort Worth.
He was known as the champion for America and five times as the main winner, but instead of being the main rival, he was an athlete in his day's race for the race and was acting as a better playing match for his problem.
Despite his peak, he is not the first to be the 48-year-old who will not beat the Scots as long as the long distance hits and the final goal is to miss the goal.
And if it's not so complicated, it's not so complicated, it's the first time in the ninth match that will take place on Sunday, with the battle of the British Obama, who will win this week with four matches.
Since the American team to begin the 12-year competitions, the four points must have a wonderful start in the single matches, so the competitive rivalry of the All-Star is the most important match.
Ferfev has expressed confidence in him, but he has not yet spoken of this.
"He was fully aware of the responsibility he had been given today, and fully accepted, and said that I was ready for the season's competition, just as hand puts on me."
"He puts more trust in him, and he's more confident in him.
He has greatly contributed to these teams during the past and the last week.
I didn't expect him to play in two matches.
I expected more than that, and it was exactly what we thought was.
Like everybody else, he wanted to be there."
On the achievement of the Nico Filfa's win at the Sunday match, he was defeated in the game.
This may have been his final goal for Wright's file, which does not apply to him fully with his personal achievement.
Ferguson has 18 wins, 20 defeats, seven of them, but has received a little more strength for the team.
He has explained that "he is funny, joking, and laughing with others, and he will be very nice if he is in the room of the team."
"I think the young men go to him and play with him, and this week there were fun functions to see.
Throughout the game, he has taught us a lot."
Europe knows Captain Thomas Pitto that Big Lee will soon disappear
Europe's Captain Thomas Pitt said that the major league match in the single season from his experience is that it can be made easier and easier for a single year than it was yesterday.
During the competition at the 1997 United States Championship at the 1997 Premier Ambassador, Selov was then a five-year-old team that had gained more than five points in the match, although the competition had won only 14-1.1⁄2 in the contest.
In the matches that took place Friday and yesterday in the league's 10-6, and after seeing the winning of Glasgow 5–3, "We got a big Lee in the 2018s, and we got the fact that we got a big look at the Big Lee in Brussels, and that this is the case.
So the history will remember me and everyone in the team, and this is still not possible.
The whole capacity of the day is to be used.
Get all your talent, and do the right things.
This is not to be completed until the points on the board are required.
We have the goal, the goal of trying to win the game, and only in it will our attention be.
From the start, I'm going to tell you that I'm focusing on 12 players on our offer, and on another category, we know about the best players on the opposite side.
I am glad that his men played in the heavy golf field, saying: "I don't want to do what I can.
Today's competition will be different.
Each person's abilities and abilities during the season should bring light, and that is a different matter for us to do.
It is wonderful to play with a partner when everything is perfect, but when you play alone, you will see that a golf player is your full potential.
This message is to tell the players clearly, reveal the full ability of your day.
Now leave your partner, and let him play alone, and let him draw his full capacity."
In contrast to Bio, the rival player Jim Ferguer, who received three points in the Ideas and Justin Thomson, is expected to be able to avoid playing alone rather than playing as his partner.
In both finals of the NATO unexpected changes, Fergus was a successful team in Brunswick before the end of the two "Michael" movement, and he was the winner of the final victory in Brussels before the end of his defeat.
In the year 1999, Ben Gregory, who stood on one of his players on the last day, replied how he acted, "I remember every word."
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, and like you see in Brussels, I want to give you a wonderful start.
When the force is placed in the same direction, it can cause a high pressure in competitions in the middle.
We have set up the sequence of our sequence, we are dead to the correct players we feel, and we have to hold some Melji in the competitions of the day."
Thomas handles the task of winning, and he works with Thomas, Paul, Justin Rose, John Ridge, and a fellow footballer with Tom Rotton McLuckie, in another row, with a half-century and other Europeans.
"I've got to go into the domain with those in this row, and I think this would lead to a victory in all directions," said Bio on his single options.
The new battleship of Germany was reopened
Instead of the old Cold Warships, it has been changed in Germany's newly opened tank ship's battleship to 2014, but the local media said that it could not even be able to take over the next year due to the increase.
The Military News newspaper said that the main ship of the new Bay-Britton-British Warshipships was placed in the "British-British" ship, which had been suspended from 2019 until half of the 20th century.
The ship was to be joined by the 2014 Winter Fleet, but the main project was in the main project due to late complications.
Four brigade ships, who were ordered to be ordered in the year 2007, will come to change to the old-fashioned Baker Warships.
It is understood that there are also steel technologies such as powerful tanks, powerful cannons, air resistance, and a structured sequence of rockets that are designed to counter the opposition of aircraft and ships.
Another important aspect of long care is that the possibility of not stopping new war ships from local ports for two years is that it would be impossible for one not to remain.
However, improved battleships by series delays may already be passing time according to foreign service, which has revealed that it is a lesson for Germany to evaluate the potential of foreigns.
During the last year, the F125 war was featured in news headlines when Germany's fleet refused to use the war force, and when it was returned to Hutton and Wolvers Schwarck in Hamburg, it was the first to be returned to the U.S. Air Force.
This was the first time a ship was returned to the company that designed it.
The media also released some of the reasons for the return, although the war was relatively clear, that the battle was the main source of the "product and software" and that the battle could be useless if used in military activity.
Since Patton-British ships were operated by a group of 120 sailors, software defects were the most important, with only half of these sailors being the only half of the crew of the old Pocket-American fleets.
In addition, the ship was on the maximum weight of his performance, and it was likely that the ship could not be able to join ships in the future by the fleet.
With a weight of 7,000 tons, it is believed that the weight used by Germany in World War II was twice as high as those of the German fighters who were used by Germany in World War II.
The cost of mass project, including the training of the ship's training team, turn into a problem.
It is said to be the highest in the country since the beginning of the season, from 2.2 Billy 3.1.1BN3.
In view of the recent warnings of the decline of Germany's naval power, the problems in the new battleship have become particularly changing.
In the beginning of this year, Hans Bart, head of the Germany Parliament, has agreed that "the maximum number of ships used in the field is relatively low in the number of ships used in the field."
The complex is becoming increasingly increasing in the day, as the old ships are unable to use, and the new ships have said that the transfer will not be granted.
He has expressed regret that the Batton-British ships were unfit to join the ship.
National Library of Watching the Secret Life of Animal Species
New research has been started on a estate in a estate in Scott Hesssberg on the purposes that bats use land for their food.
It has also expressed confidence that this will provide results of new information related to the function of mammals that are isolated and will help to overcome future security measures.
Scientists in the National Register for Scotland study about bats for the common and long-term battalions and brown bats that live in Wesley Cornwalls.
Special recordings will be applied in the most important places where they live throughout the Season's work.
NHS personnel and self-responsors will be able to use the Twitters in the pan to make sure that they are in hand.
All records are a master of sound sound-like battalions to detect the frequency of sound sounds, and what the creature does.
To create a picture of how their activity is described in the landscape, the map of living and reporting will be prepared.
The NTS Department of Conservation has expressed confidence that any parts of bats are important to the living and that each living creature is used by them.
This information will help to determine how best care for forest management benefits, bats and other related organisms.
The number of bats throughout Scotland and UU.S. has decreased significantly in the past hundred years.
They are threatened by the threat of loss of the building and development that affects birds.
Air Forces and Liberals threaten the threat, and some chemicals that kill insects and build building materials threaten the attacks of cats raised as pets.
The bats are not really blind.
However, because they seek food at night, they use their ears more than their eyes.
Technique technology uses to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
More than 270 historical buildings, the NTS, which has been responsible for the preservation of 38 main gardens and a total of 76,000 hectares throughout the country, are very focused on the case of bats.
There are ten trained experts, all of whom would engage in acts of rescue and sometimes in acts of rescue.
The company also has the protection for the preservation of the Twitter and the Commodore, which is home to the ten species of bats in the ten species of Scottish bats.
Davidson says that the estate manager Davidson is the best place for estates.
"Here's the best place to take for Wikinews in The Lavrey," he said.
"Old Buildings, More Old Trees and Good Life".
But there are still many things that we do not know about bats, here and elsewhere that our work here will help us to understand more about the things that bats are needed to thrive."
He insists that it is very important to check the maintenance process within the buildings, since the single grassland can destroy the ground, causing a loss of 400 female bats and young bats, which will almost destroy almost all species of species.
It is a legal offense to kill and kill them, torture, or destroy their habitat.
The Scottish officer Elizabeth Federler has encouraged the public to help with the security of Wikinews.
He said: "We still have to know about bats and to know more about many of our natural creatures, and how their numbers are declining."
Admiral refuses the branches related to Rodo rape, and his lawyers touch the case on the German issue
Christino said that the rape branch had been written against him was "a false message", and he said that using his name, he had issued the charges that the German news reporter Danzgers have filed with his attorneys on the issue.
Christino said that the rape branch had been written against him "a false message", using his name to "make a reputation for himself."
Portugal and the Junior Forts were charged with the rape of the American Women's Women in the Las Vegas Hotel in the year 2009.
On Friday, Dasby has announced that the incident had agreed to give him $35,000 in order to have no problem with contact.
A few hours after the news on the branches was revealed, he spoke with 33–22 million of his 14-year-old Ronald Ford in the video The Winds, and then said that the message was "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today, the news they released was a false news message, five times before the Ronaldo camera.
They want to be famous by using the name of him.
This is a regular one.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but this is their work.
I'm happy, and I'm going to be happy, and I'm going to find everything to be enjoyable."
In relation to these charges, the prosecutors of Rottendo on Duncan's case are preparing for the case, which they announced that "it is impossible to publish the message of uncertainty about the matter."
It may also be one of the most severe violations of the non-profit individual rights rights in recent years, as well as the epithetist, who may blame the victim for the loss of a credit card due to severe violation of morality.
The alleged incident is said to have occurred at the Balms Hotel and Cabinet in Los Angeles, June 2009.
According to documents presented in the Clark Deputy Court in Naples, after meeting at the Knight, the two of Ronaldo and Vatoto went to the room of Ronalddo, where he was reported to be raped and killed.
In his time after the incident, Ronaldo has said that he was saying that "99 percent of the good man" and that he was not aware that he had made a mistake.
Ronalddo is both involved in sexual intercourse, but there are documents that say it had been held by the two parties.
He has gone to the police and has taken his injuries to the hospital, and then he has agreed to the Senate outside the court, because "he is panicking about potential attacks" and "screaming in public".
Since his ongoing injury is caused by mental injury, 34 - year - old Masakaka says that he is looking for a way to avoid a collision.
Ronaldo was in the position of joining the United States Army of Manchester during the time of rape, and in this summer Italian Republicans have joined the U.S. Junior Juvenile Juvent in the Summer War.
The function from the UK, the process of exiting from the European Union: If car manufacturers lose, it'll always have to be 'to be sad'
After the departure of U.S. from the European Union, the business secretary has said that if the car loses its position in the car production, it will be "never to be sad."
In his speech to Toronto U.S.News & World Report, he said he had said that if the contract was out of the European Union, it would temporarily stop the production of the product at their factory near Derby, which is near Derby.
Mr. Clark has said, "We have to have a tea," and Clark has said.
Japanese car manufacturer has said that if there were delays about the border issues in Britain from which the agreement was made, the result would be unemployment.
In addition to the creation of the Afghans and the Austossis, Burnasa production has produced nearly 100,000 cars last year, 90% of which are exported to other parts of the European Union.
"If Britain leaves Britain at the end of the month, we will stop producing production in the industry of our industrials," said the Burtato Dominia Director of the House of Commons.
Other U.S. car manufacturers, including the BMA and Jamie Rother, have expressed their fears about how the agreement would work in one European country without knowing how the Wisss-British business would work.
For example, the BMA has said that a month after the British left in the European Union, his small business business run in Oxford was closed.
The main problem is that car manufacturers say that there will be problems with the use of the supply system if the contract has not been made up of a single European.
The production of Toyota's production system is on the basis of operating the car's components for the production of the product, from the subsidiary to the UK and European Union for every 37 minutes.
If the contract was out of the European Union on March 29 without a contract, the technology suggests that technology may result in delays and complications of parts.
The company has announced that the production could be stopped only because it is possible only to have more than one day per day in the Derby industry.
A test project for future relations with Mr Clark and Theresa May, with a European European union, said "the tests are accurate to avoid such tests in the balance."
"We need to overcome a deal that is the best deal for us, that is not to be the only successful success that we're currently going through, and that's to be the only way to use this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio program.
"Not only is it necessary for other car manufacturers to continue to do so, and that they can continue to be able to do as much as they had previously done."
Toyota could not say how long the production will be kept, but if the extra costs are long enough to reduce the competitiveness of the industry and lose jobs.
Peter Deputy, who has been working in Burma for 24 years, is inducted by the industrial Union Union, and he has increased the fear of members of his group: "They will never leave us again, and they will never again come back."
Government Newsmer said: "We have proposed a precise and reliable plan of our future relationships with one European.
The White House suggests that Drake's visit with Rochester may be late
If the Supreme Court continues to take over the case of the Supreme Premier Premier of the Presidency, the subspecies of the subspecies of the subdivision of the subspecies of the subdivision of the subdivision were the most critical meeting of Dorset Roth's Rochestra, which was made on Sunday, it was announced that "no other than the White House could be held.
Special Council Robert Muller monitors the work of Robert Muller, Robert Muller, and an investigation into the Russian election, and the interactions between Trumps and Russia, and the possibility of extreme judicial intervention.
Although the Trump's subsidiary was not removed from work, it was a result of an obstacle to the independence of Mullin, and the speech of the speech in Washington for months.
In the beginning of this month, New York Times stated that the team for recording the Trump's conversations and the possibility of the release of the 25th law enforcement code is a debate.
Rodríguez has refused the message.
But in the middle of the information he had made to resign, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, it was announced that the United Nations would then hold a meeting on Thursday with the Trump, which they had in New York.
Dr. Trump said he would not "bet" to remove Rodney, however, and then, a woman who accused him of sexual misconduct and then decided to avoid a dispute with the court of justice.
Friday, a week after the FBIII trial of protests against the GBIII trial, he delayed the win over the entire Series.
Drew's news campaigner Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News.
When asked him about that, he said: "It seems that the date of the end is not yet fixed, and that it may be a week, but it seems that it will go away with all other things in the Supreme Court in view of all other things that happen in the Supreme Court.
But look, I always want to inform the news media, and say, "I want to inform you of the information at that time."
Some news reporters will ask the question to counter the idea: The 10th to 10th is not involved by Sanders' news reporters at the White House.
Hodten Chris Walls asked why it was.
The Sanders said that the reason for the lack of the news's lack of response to the reporter's meeting was not due to the way television news reporters act "to receive praise to others" and that "I would not deny that they are doing so to others."
He then added that the more direct data connections between the truck and the news agents, the more the message will increase.
"They're the governor who attends more questions than any previous president," he said, adding that he did not quote the evidence as follows: "We've counted the figures."
Sanders told the reporters that they would no longer be present, saying, "If news reporters had the opportunity to ask directly to the President of America, it would be better to talk to me about it than to speak to me.
We're trying to make it a lot, and we've seen it as a few weeks ago you've seen it doing so, and when you can talk to the President of the United States, it's going to catch the journalist's place."
The truck is usually accompanied by foreign news reporters from the meetings when they leave the White House or participate in the open open field, and the news media usually respond to messages from the meetings.
It is rare to arrange private news meetings.
This week in New York, maybe the president would have revealed a strange appearance before the present, and why it was possible to show why.
People's secretary, the Secretary of Health, writes about the Premier Assemblys of the EU workers in NHS Scotland
People's secretary, who has also written a letter to the UH ministers serving in Scotland, to express appreciation for the country's NHS and continue to want to continue with them.
Jean Freeman wrote a letter when they were less than six months old to resign from England.
The Scottish government has already agreed to accept the cost of rent for a non-profit status for a European state that has been working for the better public services.
Mr. Freeman wrote in his letter: "In the season, England has continued to have been in the case of rejection, between England and the European words that have continued to have been held, and that it is moving toward the end of this autumn.
However, England's government is carrying out preparations and preparations for the potential hockey level.
I know that everyone of you will have this an uncertainty time.
That is why I wanted to emphasize that each of the ministers, regardless of their country, respect any share I have given.
Mentors from the European Union who come and work with me have given me a great deal of experience, skills, and abilities to help improve health service, to the patients we serve, and to the communities we serve.
Scotland has also written that your home is entirely yours, and that we want you to stay with us."

The website's record bill is high, and the taxpayers in England will vote
In addition to helping the homeless, the government hopes to increase at least $11 million annually
The purchase of property has been made available to them in England, and the public record of cash has been awarded to them - today, telling Teresa that we will help those who do not have the extra money without the house.
This action led them to the goal of making an effort to draw young voters, and to target those with high incomes.
The website's log bill can be awarded to individuals who do not pay taxes in England, companies, and companies who do not pay taxes, and the government can give the government's action to fight the situation in the house without going to sleep.
This is an extra line, which includes additional lines that have been assigned to the second house to buy, renting, and renting the house, which may be more than three percent.
The government funding is expected to raise £120 million by this action year.
As many as 13 percent of the newly constructed London assets are found in England, and those who do not have a living quarters in that time have high prices, making it too difficult for those who are attempting to buy one home first.
Many of the country's rural areas, particularly in the head, have become "the cities of refuge"—for most of the purchase is from overseas, and most people spend most of the time abroad outside the country.

Its object is to reform the domestic housing market that is damaged.
British living here, working, and creating life will always remain open mind.
However, it would not be right to say that it would be easy for those who do not live in England, and those who do not live in England, as well as foreign-based institutions, as in Britain.
For most people, the dream of buying a house has become uncertain, and it has become the reality of sleeping in the homeless and sleeping in the homeless.
Jack Rose: 'My peak aim is to manage Scotland'
Senator Jack Rose says that they will become "the goal of the moment" in the same stage as Scotland manager.
The Scots, 42, has accepted the challenge of restoring the Nord-Star, and he is in third place from the top to three points, beyond the top level.
In the last season, following the guidance of the St. Louis – the Scottish leadership, the stadium moved to the center of the summer.
"I like playing for my country as a player.
I got a B CK, that's so much, and said, Rose BBC is in the Sport of Scotland.
"But with my father, I grew up with a lot of Scottish players in Hodgkin, which has somehow brought me here.
The opportunity is to come to me only if I have successfully acted in the club management."
Among those who had been in front of São Paulo as the manager of the Rochester, Duncans, David Movie, Martin O'Neills, Roy Keen, Gores, and Pasa.
They were not an ex-election leader of the former Athletics, who had previously rejected before the pre-elections in the city of Barnes and the Izmirs and said that he had no central claim to follow the names such as this one.

In addition, Rose says that they are now more comfortable than when they come to play at the branch, Hartbaker, Ferguson, and Hamilton.
He recalls that when he said that he had taken responsibility for Afghanistan, "that might have been true crossposts," he recalls.
"I believed that if I had to play, I had the right to play the management.
This may seem strange, because I played very well for some time, and I enjoyed a good life from it, and I enjoyed a high position.
However, playing can be difficult.
On the basis of the weekly basis, there are a lot of work you have to complete.
Even now, I am living in the same way that I am living in the same way as pressures, but it seems to be better when I come out of management.
I always wanted to do management, and now I do the same, which is very comfortable, and I can make my work easier throughout my mature years."
