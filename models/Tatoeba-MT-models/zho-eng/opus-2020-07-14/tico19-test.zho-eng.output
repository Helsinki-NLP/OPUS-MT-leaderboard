The cumulative incidence of the new coronary virus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom increased rapidly between 1 January and 15 March 2020
In the EU/EEA countries as well as in the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of the new coronary virus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends, confirming that while different countries are at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing.
According to the Italian experience, the State, hospitals and intensive care wards need to be better prepared to meet the surge in the number of COVID-19 patients, with a particularly heavy burden of intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, reported several cases of undisclosed pneumonia.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control reported that pathogens are a new type of coronal virus, now known as the Severe Acute Respiratory Console 2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, diseases caused by SARS-COV-2 infection have been named coronary virus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date suggests that about 80% of the COVID-19 cases are mild, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, the COVID-19 will be in critical condition and will require hospitalization, while the remaining 6% will be in critical condition and will require intensive care.
The death rate of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom (UK) and compared it to Hubei Province of China.
We have also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom between 31 January and 15 March 2020 with Italy.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has expanded further, and the current dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are similar to those of China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the magazine European Surveillance, published on March 5, 2020, Speteri et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Europe according to the WHO definition of cases.
In EU/EEA, France reported on 24 January 2020 the first three confirmed cases of persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had detected COVID-19 cases, from 31 December to 15 March 2019, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported that day, Italy alone reported 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths.
Cumulative number and incidence of COVID-19 cases acquired
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates the number of reported COVID-19 cases in every country in the world every morning at 8 a.m., which is available only from official sources, such as national health ministries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data have been used to assess trends in EU/EEA and UK COVID-19 and to compare them with Italy.
We calculated the 14-day accumulation rate for each EU/EEA country and the British COVID-19 case for the period 1 January to 15 March 2020 as an indicator of the incidence of active COVID-19 cases in order to consider the natural pathologies of COVID-19.
We also provided the total number of reported cumulative cases per country as at 8 a.m. on March 15, 2020, and compared with data from Italy for the period from January 31st to March 15th 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The 14-day trend in the cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom is generally consistent with the cumulative incidence of cut-off in Hubei Province (China) (figure 1).
For EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February 2020 and then increased sharply around 28 February (supplementary material).
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported by Italy, but similar trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries as well as in the United Kingdom (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom between 31 January and 15 March 2020, compared with Italy.
It should be emphasized that as of March 15th, at 8 a.m., the other 15 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had reported the same total number of cases as Italy in less than three weeks.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases reported by EU/EEA and the United Kingdom is increasing rapidly.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 indicate that the epidemic is developing at a similar rate in all countries.
Although countries are at different stages, national public health responses vary, the definition of cases may vary from country to country, and there are differences in the programmes used to select those who must be tested for COVID-19 diagnosis, including additional testing, the situation is the same.
In early March 2020, according to doctors in the affected areas of Italy, about 10% of the COVID-19 patients were in need of intensive care, and media reports indicated that hospitals and intensive care wards in those areas had reached maximum capacity.
At EU/EEA level, the data available are only 6 per cent and 1 per cent (data not shown) of the COVID-19 cases admitted to the intensive care ward.
However, this information should be collected in a systematic manner in order to supplement the current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study carried out in 2010-11 showed that the number of intensive care and medium-term care beds available in European countries varied widely, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 places of intensive care and medium-term care per 100,000 persons in 2010-2011).
ECDC has modeled health-care saturation and related scenes for the sixth update of the rapid risk assessment of COVID-19 and has estimated the relationship between the prevalence of patients in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom in the hospital of COVID-19 and risk & gt; 90 per cent risk of excesses in intensive care beds.
Since so far cases have gathered in the EU/EEA countries and in certain areas of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care wards generally serve the population coverage in the defined areas, it is advisable to provide information on cases and intensive care beds at the level of the Standard Statistical Geographical Unit 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the EU/EEA and the British COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing.
Therefore, the State, hospitals and intensive care wards should be prepared to respond to the continuous community transmission of SARS-COV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care, particularly intensive care, as in the affected areas of Italy.
As noted in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, positive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the dissemination of SARS-COV-2 and requires a transition from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not allow decision makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and adjust the response.
The rapid risk assessment also listed public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity where countries can further strengthen controls to slow the spread of SARS-COV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care systems.
Otherwise, the health care system in other EU/EEA countries is likely to face a proliferation of patients in need of intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
The outbreak of the 2019 coronary virus (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronary virus 2 (SARS-COV-2) has so far infected more than 80,000 people in China and the rest of the world, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths and a massive human catastrophe.
Similar to SARS-COV, which in 2003 infected thousands of people, SARS-COV-2 may also be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Although COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, it is more communicable, affecting older persons more than young people and more men than women.
In view of the rapidly increasing number of new coronary pneumonia-related publications, this paper is intended to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving research topic.
We will present basic knowledge of epidemiology, pathology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, pre- and prevention of the disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope this overview will help to understand and eradicate this terrible disease.
Spring Festival of January 25th, 2020 became an unprecedented and engraved memory of Chinese, and the outbreak of a new viral disease forced everyone to leave their homes throughout the holidays and for many weeks thereafter.
The virus is highly homogenous with the coronary virus (COV) that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-COV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the related disease is known as coronary virus disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country, and then into nearly 50 other countries around the globe.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had led to more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, of which more than 40,000 had been discharged and more than 3,000 had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 has become the number one public enemy, and that the threat may be greater than terrorism.
According to data from PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 papers on COVID-19 have been published in less than two months since the first report of separation of the virus sequence from many patients in January 2020.
The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the progress of research in this emerging field of disciplines.
People are used to comparing COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-induced disease - the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss the knowledge gained so far on the prevention and prevention of the disease, as well as some pressing issues that have yet to be resolved.
In the past, CoV was thought to be a non-lethal pathogen for humans, causing about 15% of the common flu.
But two highly pathogenic humans have been encountered in this century, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which erupted in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality rates.
So this COVID-19 outbreak is the third CV outbreak recorded in human history.
As shown in figure 1,1 the city of Wuhan first reported cases of undisclosed pneumonia to the National Health Council of China on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was published.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported his first death.
At the same time, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
January 20, reporting that medical personnel were infected, suggesting that there might be a human being.
On January 23, Wuhan city closed down all public transport.
In January 24, the first clinical study on new coronary pneumonia, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhanhua South Sea Fresh Market, which was considered the starting point for infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak a "global health emergency".
At the time of publication of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the globe (figure 2 (Fig.2).
Due to the rapid development of the epidemic, the final scope and severity of the outbreak has yet to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients (including 4,021 diagnosed COVID-19 patients) provided an update on the epidemic, as shown below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPX1qHA2bdA).
SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting all age groups, but the main age group is 30-65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected persons are 50 years of age or older, very few are under 20 years of age, and only 14 are under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31 per 100,000) than women (0.27 per 100,000).
COVID-19 is concentrated in the northern part of the lake and its surroundings.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
Average lurking period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time between morbidity and death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Basic regeneration (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, which coincides with the time of mass population movements prior to the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate for confirmed cases was 1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent) and for all patients the adjusted mortality rate was 3.06 per cent (95 per cent CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are sex (male), age (age 60) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large subfamily of blanket viruses with a single justice chain RNA.
They can be divided into four sections, alpha, beta, gamma and platinum, where alpha-Cov and beta-Cov are known to be infected with humans.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are combined with their cell receptor vascular tension agent 2 (ACE2) and dibenzoline enzyme 4 (DPP4) and subsequent membrane integration.
The virus RNA genome was released into the cellular mass; after its replication, the genome RNA formed a cyst of the virus, together with the nectar protein and the nuclothed protein, and then integrated with the membrane and released the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
It turns out that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV, with genetic consistency exceeding 99.98 per cent of the 10 sequenced samples collected at the first outbreak site of the Wuhan South China Sea Fresh Market.
SARS-COV-2 is more similar to SARS-COV in genetic terms.
Through the transmutation electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in ultra thin slices of the surface of the airway.
The study found that ACE2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the weak combination of S protein and human ACE2 relative to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins coded by orf3b and by orf8 coded proteins.
ORF3b of SARS-COV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFN beta; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional structure domain or base sequence.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. reported on the refrigerated electron microscope (cryo-EM) structure of ACE2 for the trans-shipment of protein B0AT1 with amino acid, with resolution 2.9 Ã.
They found that the compound had an open and closed image, that it had been assembled as a dichotomy and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could combine two S proteins to provide evidence of CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 may become a drug screening target for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
As you know, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and spread to humans through beavers and camels, respectively.
By comparing the development of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoV systems, bats are considered natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because of the 96% consistency of the new virus with two SARS models from bats, Bat-SL-CoVZX45 and Bat-SL-CoVZX21 respectively.
However, it is not clear what intermediate host helps the virus to infect humans across the species barrier and its transmission routes are to be clarified.
Ji et al. suggested that snakes were carried from bats to human viruses, which involved a homogeneity within S proteins.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, believe that the presence of a coV with SARS-COV-2 is a potential intermediate host for SARS-COV-2, given the 99 per cent genetic homogeneity of a CoV found in the wearing of a hill nail, a long-kided ant, which is often used for Chinese medicine.
However, the 1 per cent difference between the two genomes is still a huge difference; therefore, specific evidence is still needed to provide a decisive result (Fig.33).
The physiology of SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro in a dry environment for 48 hours, at 20 Â°C and 40-50% humidity for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be effective in the elimination of the virus with ultraviolet and thermal sensitivity - 56 Â°C 30 minutes; Ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform and other lipid solvents, but chlorine is determined to be ineffective in the elimination of the virus.
Humans are generally immune to SARS-COV-2 and are therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies on SARS-CoV-2 immunization responses.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.4).
In general, the virus is first identified by the host ' s inherently immune system by mode (PRR), including C-culcumulent receptor, Toll Receptor (TLR), NOD Receptor (NLR) and RIG-I Receptor (RLR).
The virus is expressed through different road-induced inflammation factors, tree mutation cell maturation and ITN synthesis, which limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the infestation of its antigen cells.
But the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape the immune response.
Adaptive immune responses will soon be added to the fight against the virus.
T lymph cells, including CD4+ and CD8+T cells, play an important role in antiviral defense.
CD4+T cell irritation B cells produce virulent antibodies, while CD8+T cells directly kill infected cells.
Auxiliary T cells produce an inflammation cell factor to help these defense cells.
However, CoV can suppress T cell function by inducing T cell failure.
Immune immunisation, including supplementation â e.g., C3a and C5a â and antibodies, is also essential to the fight against infection.
For example, antibodies separated from recovered patients can be compared to MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excess response of the immune system can generate a large number of liberal foundations in some parts, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst cases, multiple organ failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a concentration of sexually transmitted diseases, is more likely to affect older persons with multiple combinations, as well as pregnant women.
Usually, individuals exposed to a large number of viruses or impaired immune functions are more likely to be infected than others.
According to a study of the earliest 425 cases in Wuhan City, the average depth period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated at 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed an average lurking period of 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned earlier, a recent study shows that according to the demographics of 8,866 cases, the lurking period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
For the health sector, it is important to adjust effective isolation periods to the most accurate latency periods so as to prevent the transmission of the virus to others by people with no symptoms of infection.
As a rule, people in contact with the virus or infected need to be separated for 14 days.
Should the period of isolation be extended to 24 days?
Heating is usually the main and initial symptoms of COVID-19, and can be accompanied by any other symptoms, such as cough, gas, muscle pain, headaches, nausea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients suffer from respiratory difficulties and/or hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.
The severers move rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome, peptic shock, metabolic acid poisoning and condensation disorders.
Even if there are no pulmonary imaging anomalies, patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should undergo a virus screening for early diagnosis.
A demographic study carried out in late December showed that the percentage of symptoms was: fever 98 per cent, cough 76 per cent, respiratory difficulties 55 per cent, diarrhoea 3 per cent; 8 per cent of patients needed air support.
Two recent studies on family agglomerations of sexually transmitted diseases and the unsymptomatic individual transmission of the disease have reported similar results.
In contrast, a demographic study carried out in 2012 showed that the major symptoms were heat (98 per cent), cough (47 per cent) and respiratory difficulties (55 per cent).
However, 80% of these patients need air support, much more than the COVID-19 patients, in line with the mortality rate of the MERS than the COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26 per cent) and osmosis (21 per cent) were also observed among MERS patients.
Among SARS patients, it has been shown that fever (99% to 100%), cough (29% to 75%), respiratory difficulties (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and throat pain (13-25%) are the main symptoms, and about 14% to 20% of patients require air support.
As of February 14, there were 66,576 confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, with a 2% mortality rate.
By contrast, as of November 2002, the mortality rate of SARS in 8,096 confirmed cases was 10%.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate of 2,494 confirmed cases was 37%.
An early study reported that RSS-CoV-2 R0 was as high as 6.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) was 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only 2 to 4.
Table 1.1 shows the comparison of SARS-COV-2 with MERS-COV and SARA-COV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0.
According to the above data, SARS-COV-2 is more diffuse than MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but less lethal than the latter.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-COV-2 epidemic is more challenging than MERS-COV and SARS-COV.
Accumulative diseases usually occur within the same family or from the same gathering or transportation, such as cruise ships.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other epidemic areas, or of close contact with infected persons or patients in the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that the cured patients who have been discharged can carry the virus again, thereby warning of prolonged isolation.
The number of hemoglobin cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages of the disease is normal or decreasing.
For example, white cell count & lt; 4x109/L - including lymphocyte count & lt; 1x109/L - was detected in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, rising amino amino amino amino transfer enzyme levels and viral haemorrhage.
Some patients see elevated levels of hepatic and mussel enzymes in their bloodlines, as well as of mystroglobin, and most of them see elevated levels of blood C-reactive proteins and haemorrhage.
Heavy-duty patients can see elevated levels of D-dipolar protein degradation and reduced lymphocytes.
Most of the COVID-19 patients can see a chest image anomaly, characterized by a double-skinned shading or a pulmonary grinding glass shadow.
Patients usually experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and fibrosis seriously damage gas exchange.
Pulmonary cell function disorders in type I and type II pulmonary bubbles reduce the level of surfactants and increase surface tension, thereby reducing lung expansion and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
So, the worst chest imaging results usually occur at the same time as the most serious diseases.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis by COVID-19 found in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease that the pulmonary cortex cells were decomposed, transparent membrane formed, inter-septic lymphocyte immersion and polynucleus cells, consistent with viral infections and the pathological performance of ARDS, and similar to those of SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been used as the main criterion for diagnosing COVID-19 by reversing the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
However, since higher pseudo-negative rates are likely to accelerate the epidemic, China began to use clinical evidence (and no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) for diagnosis on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred when SARS was diagnosed.
Therefore, in the context of medical history, clinical performance, laboratory examination and visual results are essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Zhang Feng team reported on a programme to test SARS-COV-2, using CRRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology, which uses less than an hour 's concentration of only 20 x 10-18 mol/L to 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies of viruses per litre) without a sophisticated instrument.
If proven in clinical samples, this new technology is expected to significantly increase the sensitivity and ease of diagnosis.
Due to a lack of experience in treating new types of CoVs, doctors mainly provide support treatment to COVD-19 patients while attempting to use or propose treatments for other COVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table (Table2).2).
These include current and potential treatment methods such as antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of rehabilitated patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It's even recommended that the plasma of a recovering patient be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing for antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacked primarily the lungs and may also express other organs of ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys, at a lower level.
Nevertheless, respiratory disorders and failure are major threats to patients and leading causes of death.
Respiratory support is therefore essential to mitigating symptoms and saving lives, including conventional oxygen, high-flow oxygen, zero and machine-generated air, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms must be supported by in vitro membrane oxidation (ECMO), an improved cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and peptic shock and protection of vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-COV-2 patients.
It is well known that excessive immune system responses by SARS and MERS patients can lead to cell factor storms.
Cell factors are a form of systemic inflammation and are characterized by the release of a range of cell factors, including TNFÎ±, IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6, IFNÎ±, IFN beta, IFN gamma and MCP-1.
These cell factors induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which is the main cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunization inhibition is crucial in the treatment of cell factors storms, especially among patients with severe illnesses.
Pseudosteroids and toads are resistant - an IL6 monoclon antibodies - have been used to treat cell factor storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cell factors storms include: regulation of T cell-directed immune responses; interruption of IFN-gamma, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; Bona ' s anti-opposition; cell-based signal transfer inhibitors 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants to treat SARS to reduce the severity of the damage caused by inflammation.
However, large doses of steroids are not useful for severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the contrary, they may cause serious side effects, especially the loss of the haemorrhage, which could seriously affect the prognosis.
Nevertheless, it is recommended that patients with acute distress COVID-19 should be treated with caution with low- and medium-dose cortex steroids.
At the time of writing, the existence of effective antiretroviral therapy had not been confirmed.
However, it has been found that Red Silvee, a nucleic acid analogue, has an intravenous drug that works for a COVID-19 patient in the United States.
Red Seville is a new type of antiviral drug developed by Gillid, originally used to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg.
Later, it was proved that Redhesway might contain other single-chain RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
For these reasons, Gilid has provided the drug to China for two clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons, the results of which are expected.
In addition, the use of Barrick Denny, alpha-traverser, Lopinave/Litonave and Libavelin as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms has been recommended.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse effects may occur as a result of joint treatment in Lopinawa/Litonave.
The interaction between these treatment methods and other drugs used by patients should be carefully monitored.
Pulse and antibody generation for rehabilitated patients
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients recovering from infectious diseases to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from infection.
In fact, recovered patients usually contain relatively high levels of antibodies in their bloodstream against pathogens.
Antigens are an immunoglobin (Ig) produced by B lymphatic cells against pathogens and other things that identify unique molecules in pathogens and directly engage with them.
Based on this principle, plasma is collected from a group of recovered Covid-19 patients and injected to 10 patients in critical condition.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, and they were found to have reduced inflammation and viral loads and increased saturation of blood oxygen.
However, prior to the development of special heterogeneity therapy, there is a need for validation and clarification to suggest methods that can be used on a large scale.
Also, given the effects of the treatment, some of the shortcomings associated with the plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immune reactions and cause cell factors to release syndromes, a toxic reaction that may endanger life.
The level of antibodies in blood is generally low and the demand for plasma for treatment of patients at risk is high.
It's hard enough to develop and produce antibodies fast enough to confront a global epidemic.
Therefore, the more critical and practical approach is to separate B cells from recovered patients and to identify the genetic code for coded effective antibodies, or to screen effective antibodies against proteins necessary for the virus.
In this way, we can easily expand the production of antibodies.
In China, it's been thousands of years since TCM was used to treat many diseases.
However, the efficacy of treatment depends to a large extent on the combination of multiple components in the prescription, which differs from the diagnosis of diseases based on the TCM theory.
Most active ingredients remain unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combination.
At present, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or who have recovered from a severe phase of illness due to the lack of effective and heterogeneous therapy for COVID-19.
For example, it has been found that desorption capsules and even pristine capsules are effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
In several provinces of China, 87 per cent of patients use TCM treatment, with the highest rates observed for COVID-19 patients, including Gansu (63.7 per cent), Ningxia (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while only about 30 per cent of COVID-19 patients in Hubei Province use TCM treatment, with the lowest rates (13 per cent).
However, this is only a rough comparison, since many other factors of influence, such as the number and severity of patients, should also be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Chambere and his colleagues published a study comparing the Western Medicines (WM) with the WM and TCM combined treatments.
They found that the WM+TCM body temperature recovery, the loss of symptoms and the length of hospitalization were significantly shorter than the MM group.
Most impressively, the rate of symptomatic deterioration (from light to heavy) of the WM+TCM group is significantly lower than that of the simple WM group (7.4 per cent versus 46.2 per cent) and the mortality rate of the WM+TCM group is equally lower than that of the simple WM group (8.8 per cent versus 39 per cent).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM still require a higher quality control test, a wider range and more centres to prove it.
The identification of TCM treatments or their combinations as a mechanism for their functioning and, where possible, the articulation of their effective components will also be of concern.
Most of the patients suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19 will be extremely afraid of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and the isolated will be distressed, lonely and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, oxygen deficiency and cough, as well as adverse treatment responses, such as insomnia caused by cortex steroids, may increase anxiety and psychological distress.
During the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychological reactions were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychoactive excitement, psychiatric symptoms, paranoia and even suicide.
As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory close contact tracking and isolation increases anxiety and guilt about the effects of infection, isolation and stigmatization on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspected cases, close contacts and the public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams to avoid close contact by regularly and accurately updating SARS-COV-2 outbreak information and treatment programmes.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the transmission chain from animal hosts and infected patients to vulnerable hosts, and are often used as a supplement to antiviral treatment in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
The industry has made efforts to develop an S-protein-based vaccine to produce long-term and effective medium- and antibodies and/or protective immunization against SARS-CoV.
The DPT vaccine has been evaluated in the SARS animal model.
However, prior to the initiation of clinical studies, the efficacy of these candidate vaccines in old age and lethal assault models and their protection from co-infection with the virus had not been determined.
It's probably because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and concentrated infections of MERS in the Middle East region continue to occur and spread to other regions as a result of the persistence of common human and animal causes of disease in the affected areas.
Through the use of live viruses, DNA particles, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral sample particles and recombinant protein sub-cyloids, vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine for non-immunized individuals against SARS-COV-2 is an urgent and critical task in controlling the current epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome this difficulty due to the length of time required for vaccine development (average of 18 months) and the dynamics of the CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to present its entire clinical process among thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually, without consequences.
But, like SARS and MERS, the COVID-19 patients have high morbidity and mortality rates.
Therefore, the establishment of an advanced model of the disease is essential for health-care institutions to prioritize services, especially in areas with limited resources ...
According to clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect the prognosis or subsequent relevance of the COVID-19 patient (Table (Table33)):
Age: Age is the most important factor influencing SARS prognosis, also for COVID-19.
As mentioned earlier, in a study that included 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred mainly in the 30-65 age group, of which 47.7 per cent were over 50 years of age.
Patients in need of intensive care are more likely to have basic collage and complications, and to be significantly older than patients in need of intensive care (median 66-to 51-year-olds), suggesting that age is a prognosis of the outcome of the COVID-19 patient.
Sex: As mentioned earlier, more men than women are infected with SARS-COV-2 (0.31 per 100,000 versus 0.27 per 100,000).
Combining and complications: Covid-19 patients in intensive care are more likely to suffer acute heart damage and heart disorder.
Heart attack is also the leading cause of SARS deaths.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to be associated with ACE2 positive cholinens, which may lead to liver abnormalities in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age is closely related to underlying diseases and may affect each other.
Laboratory results are abnormal: C Reaction Protein (CRP) levels in blood reflect the severity of the inflammation or tissue damage and have been considered a disease, therapeutic response and potential prognosis for eventual recovery.
It was also suggested that CRP levels were relevant to the severity of COVID-19 and the prognosis.
In addition, increases in emulsion dehydrase (LDH), amino amino amino ammonium transfer enzyme (AST), amino amino transfer enzymes (ALT) and muscle acid hormones (CK) may also help predict the end.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
So they're traditional signs of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: The timing of breast imaging tests and clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other issues to predict the fate and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As mentioned earlier, steroids are immunosuppressants and are usually used as auxiliary treatments for communicable diseases in order to reduce the severity of the damage caused by inflammation.
As a result of the widespread use of high doses of cortex steroids for heavy SARS patients, many survivors suffer from hypothermia, leading to permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, steroids should be used at small doses and for short periods of time in COVID-19 patients, if necessary.
Psychological stress: As mentioned earlier, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients were under great stress because they were often subjected to prolonged isolation and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of relatives and patients.
Psychological counselling and long-term support must be provided to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies to date, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to differ from SARS.
In addition to reproduction in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively replicated in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
As a result, infected persons generate a large number of viruses in the course of their day-to-day activities at an early stage of onset or incubation, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is considered to occur when the patient is seriously ill and most of it does not occur at an early stage.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more serious and difficult to control than SARS.
China is currently making tremendous efforts, including the blockade of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuous isolation of almost all its population, with a view to disrupting the spread of SARS-COV-2.
Although these measures have already caused serious economic and other damage in China, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating that the pace of the epidemic is slowing down ...
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March, and the downturn will continue for three to four months.
However, some other experts are less optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19 is significantly more contagious than SARS and will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others have developed models for predicting the effects of the epidemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to infect two thirds of the global population.
A Canadian team reported that 2 patients who recovered and discharged from the hospital a week ago detected SARS-Cov-2 in their noses and swabs, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a cyclical epidemic similar to influenza.
However, with the reduction in the number of new cases, there are already encouraging signs that the current strategy may have worked.
Ebola was predicted to cause 1 million cases and half a million deaths.
But, through strict isolation, the disease is finally under control.
Similar to SARS-COV, SARS-COV-2 may become less contagious and eventually disappear or become less pathogenic viruses coexist with the human body.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can be transmitted by coughing or sneezing, or possibly even by direct contact with virus-contaminated objects.
The virus is also found in excreta, which increases the likelihood of its transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases, 41 per cent of which may have been caused by in-patient infections, included 17 patients who had previously suffered from other diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Therefore, more intensive preventive measures should be taken to protect the population, especially health-care workers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even bystanders who have had contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defence that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 dust masks (1860s series) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgery masks prevent droplets from potential infected persons from spreading in the air or sticking to the surface of objects that may be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (1860s series) masks prevent the inhalation of viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of viruses fully penetrating; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, with approximately 85 nm.
Since the virus particles can even penetrate five folded surgical masks, medical personnel in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (1860s series) masks instead of surgical masks.
In addition to the mask, medical personnel should wear isolation suits to further reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also spread through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor with N95 mask infected SARS-CoV-2; the virus could have entered it through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, medical personnel should also wear transparent masks or eyeglasses when facing patients.
For the public in areas affected or potentially affected by the epidemic, it is strongly recommended that all people use disinfectant soap to wash their hands more frequently than usual, stay indoor self-segregated as much as possible and limit contact with potential infected persons.
Three feet is considered the right distance for people to stay away from patients.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the human world as a new virus, based on deep memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak, its high level of homogeneity with SARS-CoV, reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused China to be highly alert.
However, until January 19th, 2020, the Director of the Wuhan City Center for Disease Prevention and Control was still plaguing citizens, saying that the new virus was not very contagious, that it had limited human reach and that the epidemic was preventable.
The news clearly eased the public's vigilance, and the spring festival is coming, and the key node to contain the epidemic in Wuhan has been missed.
China ' s disease control agencies may learn from this painful lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these bodies should (1) be more cautious in issuing announcements, since each word is vital to citizens and can change their attitudes and decision-making; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from hospitals rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) control potential outbreaks more strictly at an early stage than attempt to appease the public; and (4) conduct more frequent targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of the epidemic and regularly test and improve social response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new virus SARS-COV-2 started at the end of December 2019.
At the time of writing, in less than two months, it had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the globe.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-COV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak looks like SARS recurrence.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects more older persons than young people and more men than women, and the severity and mortality of older patients is higher than that of younger patients.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44 per cent).
Even without symptoms, the COVID-19 patients transmit the virus, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are seriously ill, which makes it much more difficult to control the COVID-19 transmission than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, the regular RSS-COV-2 RNA test may be negative.
On the other hand, a cured patient may turn to the sun again.
These findings have significantly increased the risk of transmission of the virus.
Given the rapidness of the study on COVID-19, the following key issues remain to be resolved:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the genetic homogeneity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bats like SARS CoV, we still can't come to the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What kind of animal transmits the virus from its original host, assumed to be a bat, to the human host?
If we don't know the answers to questions 1 and 2, we can't effectively cut off the transmission route and the outbreak can happen again at any time.
Although molecular models and biochemical analyses have proved that SARS-CoV-2 is combined with ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter a gas channel cell and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also combine cells expressing ACE2 in other organs?
If there are no clear answers to these questions, we will not be able to achieve rapid, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve in the process of human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic? Will it disappear like SARS? Or will it re-emerge regularly like flu?
Finding answers to these and many other questions is essential, but it may take longer.
However, regardless of the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic and return our lives to normal as soon as possible.
It's the origin of the coronary disease.
For thousands of years, mutation and adaptive forces have been driving the coronavirs, CoVs and their host (including humans) to develop together.
Before 2003, it was known that there were two types of coronary virus (HCOV) that could cause mild diseases, such as common flu.
The outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has reversed the situation and revealed the destructive and lethal nature of HCOV infections.
The SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in central China at the end of 2019 has once again made CoV the focus of attention, and surprisingly, it is more contagious than its sister-in-law virus SARS-CoV, but less pathogenic.
HCOV infection is a common disease, so knowing the origin of HCOV's common disease will be very helpful to us.
Most HCOVs come from bats and are non-pathogenic.
Some of the HCOV intermediate storage hosts are also known.
The identification of animal hosts is directly relevant to the prevention of human diseases.
The study of coV host interactions in animals may also give us a deeper understanding of the mechanisms for the development of the coV.
In this overview, we have outlined the existing knowledge of seven HCOVs, highlighting their discovery history, the origins of common human and animal diseases and inter-plant transmission.
It's important that we compare and compare different HCOVs from the point of view of the evolution of the virus and genomics.
In this context, we look at the current epidemic of the 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19).
In addition, it focuses on the requirements for successful host conversion and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease.
CoV is a coronary virus, made up of a group of justice single-chain RNA viruses with a blanket.
These viruses have the largest genome of the RNA virus, with 2.6 to 32,000 bases, known as coronary viruses because of their coronary form under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoV has a non-particular genome that shares similar organizations.
About two thirds of the genomes contain two large overlapping open-reading boxes (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab copy enzyme polypolyte.
These polyglobins have been further processed to produce 16 unstructured proteins called nsp1-16.
The rest of the genome consists of structural ORFs, including puncture (S), film (E), film (M) and protein (N).
Many spectrum-specific auxiliary proteins are also coded by CVs in different spectrum systems.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, CoV is divided into four sections (Î±-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and platinum-CoV), of which beta-CoV is comprised of most HCoVs and is broken down into four spectra (A, B, C and D).
System development evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main host of gamma-CoVs and pyro-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoV has been crossing species barriers, some of which have become important human pathogens.
So far, seven human coronary viruses (HCOVs) have been known.
HCov-229E and HCov-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Other 5 beta-CoVs include HcoV-OC43, HcoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus (SARS-COV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronary virus (MERS-COV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 generally cause mild symptoms such as common flu and/or diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV-2 and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, leading to severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively larger number of patients, and are more likely to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, ARDS) and external lung behaviour.
In the mid-60s, the first HCOV-229E virus strain B814 was separated from the nasal secretion of common cold patients.
Since then, humans have accumulated more relevant knowledge through extensive research into both HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 viruses that can cause self-restrictive symptoms.
In fact, before the SARS outbreak, the notion that HCOV was usually harmless was widely accepted.
The outbreak of SARS in 2003 was one of the most devastating events in the current history, with more than 8,000 infections and a crude death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, after the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the epidemic continued to spread in the Arabian Peninsula and spread sporadically to other parts of the world.
2019 The new HCOV virus (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-COV-2) is a pathogen of the persistent 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19), which, as of March 3, 2020, has taken over 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people.
The alarm has been sounded and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-COV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCOVs have a common origin of disease from bats, rats or domestic animals.
There is a variety of evidence that all HCOV evolutions originate in bats, where the virus is well adapted and non-pathogenic, but shows great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has brought enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracking HCOV ' s human and animal coronal origins provides the framework for understanding the natural history, drivers and limitations of the leaping of the virus species.
In addition, it will guide or facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2 storage hosts, intermediate hosts and extended animal hosts, which will be important to prevent future outbreaks of the virus.
In this overview, we provide an overview of the origins of HCOV human and animal disease, the mechanisms of inter-creative transmission and morbidity.
In particular, we have highlighted and explored a common theme, that HCOV parent viruses are generally not pathogenic in their natural hosts, but pathogenic after trans-species have spread to new hosts.
In addition, we have reviewed the trend of HCOV evolution, in which the increase in transmission is often accompanied by a reduction in pathogenicity.
In this context, we also discussed the results of the ongoing SARS-COV-2 epidemic.
Since the late 1930s, the animals CoV have been widely known.
Before the first separation of HCOV-229E strain B814 from the nasal secretion of common cold patients, medical practitioners had separated different CoVs from a variety of infected animals (including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs).
In the last few decades, seven species of HCOV have been discovered.
A brief chronology of the history of HCOV discoveries (table 1) will provide us with a wealth of information and guidance.
In 1966, the first HCOV-229E strain was separated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory infections and subsequently adapted to growth in WI-38 lung cell strains.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E have headaches, sneezing, discomfort, common cold symptoms such as throat pain, 10-20% fever, cough, etc.
In the second half of 1967, HcoV-OC43 was separated from organ development and subsequent successive generations of the breast brain.
The clinical characteristics of HCOV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCOV-229E and do not differ significantly from the symptoms of other respiratory pathogen infections (e.g. influenza A virus and nose virus).
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are distributed globally, mainly in temperate climate winter.
Usually, these two viruses have less than a week of incubation, and then they're about two weeks old.
A human volunteer study shows that a healthy individual infected with HCov-229E has a mild common flu.
Only a few low-immunisation patients showed severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as anomalous pneumonia, is the first well-documented HCOV-induced pandemic in human history, with its pathogen being SARS-CoV, the third detected HCOV.
The first case of SARS goes back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic caused 8,096 reported cases, 774 deaths and spread to many countries and continents.
In addition to the supertransmiters, it is estimated that each case could result in approximately 2 subsequent cases, with a lurking period of 4-7 days, with a peak in viral load on the tenth day of the outbreak.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially showed late symptoms of muscle pain, headache, fever, discomfort and cold war, followed by respiratory difficulties, coughing and stress disorder.
The reduction of lymphocytes, the abnormality of liver screening and the increase of myostatic enzymes are the laboratory abnormalities common to SARS.
In addition, pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary damage was observed among SARS patients, with an increase in upper-skin cell breeding and macrophages.
Then about 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical air conditioning.
Among these patients, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, the liver and kidneys, are also likely to be infected, often accompanied by a cell factor storm, which may be fatal in patients with low immune function.
The virus was first separated from an open pulmonary pulmonary checkup of a relative of patients from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, people have been working on HCOV research.
HCov-NL63 separated from a seven-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus was initially found to be prevalent among young children, the elderly and those suffering from respiratory disorders.
Among the diseases caused by HCOV-NL63, nostrils, meningitis, fever and bronchitis are common.
Another independent study shows that the same virus was separated from the nasal specimen of an eight-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although the virus was found in the Netherlands, it is in fact distributed globally.
It is estimated that HCOV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases with peaks in early summer, spring and winter.
HCov-NL63 is related to obstructive larynx (also known as Grub dysentery).
In the same year, HCov-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong due to pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to community access to pneumonia and bronchitis, there are reports that HCOV-HKU1 is associated with acute asthma.
Similar to HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229/E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 has been found worldwide and can cause mild respiratory diseases.
All four communities have acquired HCOV well adapted to humans and are often unlikely to undergo mutations leading to high pathogenic diseases, but there have also been accidents and unknown causes, such as a more toxic rare subtype of HCOV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.
Usually, these HCOVs are less toxic or pathogenic when they acquire the ability to effectively transmit and sustain in humans.
MERS-CoV was first separated from the lungs of a 60-year-old acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases are from the Middle East, imported cases have been reported in European countries and Tunisia, with occasional subsequent transmissions to persons in close contact.
In 2015, subsequent transmission erupted again in Korea and 186 confirmed cases were diagnosed.
The clinical performance of MERS is similar to SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, acute kidney failure has also occurred in many MERS patients, which is unique in the disease caused so far by HCOV.
More than 30% of patients suffer from diarrhea and gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported, with a high mortality rate of 34.4 per cent, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to mankind.
In mid-December 2019, patients with concentrated pneumonia were found in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, and a retrospective analysis confirmed their association with SARS-COV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization has declared the continued outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-COV-2 to be a public health emergency of international concern and has named the disease COVID-19.
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases had been diagnosed globally, with a crude death rate of 3.4 per 1,000 live births.
It is worth noting that the rate of deaths in Hubei, China, is 4.2 per cent, while the rate of deaths outside Lake North is 1.2 per 1,000.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory infections, manifested in heat, coughing and respiratory difficulties.
Some of the patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to 82% of the high nucleotide sequence homogeneity, they are congregated to different branches in system growth trees.
SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but more contagious.
The reported emergence of SARS-COV-2 non-symptomatic infections could accelerate the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
Compare and compare SARS-CoV-2 with the other 6 HCOVs, we can find very interesting similarities and differences.
First of all, HcoV's illness has a very similar incubation and duration.
At this point, SARS-COV-2 is consistent with the overall trend of the other six HCOVs.
Second, the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-COV and four communities with access to HCOV (i.e. HCOV-229/E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-COV-2 infections exhibit characteristics that are more common in community-accessible HCOV infections, including non-specific, light or even symptomatic manifestations.
On the other hand, a small number of serious COVID-19 cases are also found in SARS-COV infections, although the percentage is slightly lower.
Third, the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns of community access HCOV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-COV-2 is at least as high as community access HCOV.
On the other hand, whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission, like SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, will decline after human transmission is still to be verified.
Finally, like other HCOVs, SARS-COV-2 can be detected in excreta samples.
At least in some cases, the question of whether SARS-COV-2 dung-mouth transmission plays an important role, as in SARS-COV, remains to be clarified in future studies.
Also, it is important to see if SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as community access HCOV.
However, the characteristics of SARS-COV-2 transmission, pathogenicity and the continuous transmission of the epidemic after generations will have an important impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All four communities with mild symptoms have acquired HCOV well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, humans have adapted well to these four types of HCOV.
In other words, both sides could be survivors of the ancient HCOV pandemic.
HcoV and people with serious HcoV diseases have died.
For this reason, HCOV must be sufficiently replicated in humans to accumulate adaptive mutations against host limitation factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-COV-2 epidemic lasts, the more infected it is, the more likely it is that it will be fully adapted to humans.
If it is well adapted, its transmission in humans will be difficult to stop through isolation or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four of these communities have acquired a coronary virus that spreads among the population, resulting in common influenza for those with normal immune functions.
These viruses don't need animal hosts.
By contrast, high pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted to humans and cannot continue to spread among them.
They need to survive and reproduce among the common ill host of humans and animals and may seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets through one or more intermediate host and extended host communities.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to those of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and 4 community access HCOV.
It's as contagious as community access HCOV, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than community access HCOV and less pathogenic than SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to humans and circulates within humans without host or intermediate host.
Before discussing the origins of HCOV animals, we have some guidance on the evolution of HCOV hosts, natural hosts, storage hosts, intermediate hosts and expanding the definition and characteristics of host owners.
If an animal has a closely related ancestor at high nucleotide sequence level, the animal will be an evolutionary host of HCOV.
Ancestry viruses are usually adaptive and non-pathological in this host.
Similarly, storage hosts carry HCov.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and the natural host of HCOV or its progeny.
By contrast, if HcoV was just born in the middle host shortly after or immediately after, it would not be well adapted to the new host and would normally be pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as a source of human-infected human-dwelling disease and expand the host by allowing a brief replication of the virus and then spreading it to humans in order to increase the scale of human infection.
If HCOV cannot sustain its transmission in the middle host, there may be an end-of-pipe infection.
On the contrary, HcoV can adapt to the intermediate host and even establish a long-term locality.
In this case, the intermediate host became the natural storage host.
Epidemiological data retrospective analysis found that SARS indexed cases had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence surveys show higher levels of immunoglobin (IgG) in animal dealers compared to the general population.
For the first time in the live animal market, beavers and a beaver were found carrying an almost identical SARS-CoV virus.
The fact that there are no further SARS reports after all the beavers in the market have been removed indirectly supports this view.
However, reports suggest that farm beavers who are wild or not exposed to the living animal market are largely negative in their testing of SARS-CoV, suggesting that beavers may be merely magnifying the host in the middle rather than the natural host of SARS-COV.
It is worth noting that since 80% of the different animals on the Guangzhou market have SARS-COV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that a wide range of small mammals may also be able to expand hostships among SARS-COVs.
All these animals seem to be the terminal host of SARS-CoV.
A subsequent study of SARS-CoV natural host found a closely related bat coronary virus known as the SARS-related daisy coronary virus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) that survived in the middle daisy.
These bats are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
The virus and other bat coronary viruses have 88-92% nucleic acid sequence homogeneity.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept of bats as hosts of emerging human pathogens.
In addition, researchers have identified multiple SARS coronary viruses (SL-COVs) from bats, but no virus can be separated as a living virus except for a designated WIV1.
The human arterial tension agent 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor of SARS-CoV.
Experimental evidence suggests that the WIV1 taken from a bat dung sample uses bats, beavers and human ACE2 as a receptor to enter a cell.
Interestingly, the serum of SARS patients during recovery can be reduced to WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the closest ancestors to bat SARS-CoV, with 95% nucleic acid sequence homogeneity.
Although the two viruses are highly homogenous, it is generally assumed that WIV1 is not a direct progeny of SARS-COV, nor is a bat a direct storage host of SARS-COV.
System development analysis classifies MERS-CoV with bats CoV-HKU4 and bats CoV-HKU5.
Bats CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor dichloride 4 (DPP4) to invade the virus.
RNA dependence RNA polymerase sequences are more closely associated in system development with beta-Cov bats from Europe and Africa.
To date, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV has only 87% nucleotide sequence homogeneity with its close relative bat CoV-HKU25.
Therefore, bats may not be directly stored by MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that single-fested camels are seropositive for both the MeRS-CoV and antibodies, as are camels originating in the Middle East from several African countries.
The live MeRS-CoV, which is separated from the noses of single-peak camels, is the same virus as the one found in the body, which further indicates that the camels are the true storage hosts of the MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that in camels with experimental infection MERS-CoV, symptoms are generally slight, but a large number of viruses are observed to fall.
It is worth noting that infected camels transmit the virus not only through their respiratory tract, but also through their faecal route, which is also the main route through which bats distribute the virus.
However, problems remain, as many of the cases diagnosed by MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which may be attributed to human-borne or unknown transmission routes, including unidentified species of animals carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% nucleotide homogeneity with a bat separated from a daisy.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are too large to determine filiation.
In other words, unless almost the same bat coronary virus is discovered in the future, bats may not be the direct storage host of SARS-CoV-2.
It is assumed that the middle animal host of SARS-COV-2 should be among the wildlife species sold and slaughtered at the South China Sea Wholesale Market, with many of the original COVID-19 cases associated with it, suggesting that there may have been an animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on macrogenomic sequencing have shown that an endangered small mammal, known as the mound, may also carry an ancestor associated with SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV.
These new cylindrical virus genomes have the same origin as SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid sequences of 85-92%.
But they're also very close to the RatG13, with about 90% homogeneity at nucleic acid sequence levels.
In system growth trees, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2 virus subsystems, one of which has a more similar receptor combination (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 and 97.4% amino acid sequence homogeneity.
In contrast, RSS-CoV-2 and RTTG13 differ even more widely, although the sequences of the two genomes are more homogenous.
An earlier study of disease through mountain nails also reported the detection of an overlap of the virus from lung samples, with similar results to SARS-CoV-2.
The study, using different assembly methods and manual processing, obtained some genome sequences representing approximately 86.3% of the entire genome of the virus.
We can't rule out the possibility of being one of the middle animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 is directly derived from the presence of the nails, due to differences in the beta-Cov-2 sequence associated with the piercing of the nails.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-COV-2 and the beta-COV associated with the cross-country SARS-COV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 evolution paths in bats, through nails and other mammals are still to be determined.
Although the highest sequence homogeneity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and the ranger, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 have the highest whole genome sequence homogeneity.
It can be highly assumed that the highly similarity between the beta-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 interfaces in mountain-piercing SARS-COV-2 is caused by the convergence and evolution of the selective interface.
The other opposite view is that the Be-CoV and RatG13 reorganise in the third species of wild animals in connection with the mountain-piercing SARS-COV-2.
As a driving force of evolution, reorganization is widespread in beta-CoV.
The origin of direct human and animal disease in SARS-COV-2 is not yet known.
In addition to HCOV high pathogenicity, researchers have studied the origins of HCov-229E, HCov-OC43, HCov-NL63 and HCov-HKU1.
System development evidence suggests that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E may have originated in bat coronary viruses, while the progeny of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 have also been found in rodents.
According to the report, the bat coronary virus known as ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in three-collar bats in North America appears to be closely related to HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HcoV-229E has a genetic connection with another bat-circle virus found in Ghana (known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008), in which camels are suspected to be host.
For the sake of clarity, figure 1 and table 2 summarize existing knowledge of known animal origins in HCOV.
System development analysis provides evidence of historical inter-species transmission of HCOV.
Around 1890, when HCOV-OC43 infected humans from cross-species livestock, there was a pandemic of respiratory infections.
The history of inter-familial transmission of HCOV-229E is unclear.
Bat alpha-CoV, closely related to HcoV-229E, has been discovered.
There's a camel between the two, alpha-Cov.
There's a lot of evidence to support the transmission of the virus directly from bats to humans.
First, humans, not camels, may contact bats in a common ecological position.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with camels.
Secondly, the bats associated with HCOV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while the camels Î±-CoV cause respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, no camels were found in wildlife, alpha-Cov.
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that camels have access to HCOV-229E-related alpha-coVs from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Nipa and Hendra.
So it's not surprising that bats transmit HcoV-229E directly to humans.
Or, although bat alpha-CoV serves as a gene bank for HCOV-229E, camels and single-peak camels may be the middle host of the virus to humans, which is exactly the same as MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good illustration of the spread from bats to single Peaks and from single Peaks to humans.
The evolution of the bat's MERS-CoV origin was known in its initial identification and subsequent discoveries reinforced this argument.
Apparently, bats provide a rich reservoir of viral species for the inter-species exchange and inter-species transmission of genetic fragments.
Long-lived and dense groups, close social interaction and strong flying power are all favourable conditions for bats to become the ideal "viral communicators".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in single-peak camels for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, and the camels have moved from the middle host to the stable natural reservoir.
MERS-CoV causes very minor diseases in these animals and maintains a relatively low mutation rate.
Its sporadic spread to humans was an accident, and because it was not sustainable, humans remained the terminal host of the MERS-CoV.
In contrast to the role of camels in the dissemination of the MARS-COV, the role of nails in the dissemination of SARS-COV-2, if any, is different.
In particular, it's highly pathogenic in mountain nails, beta-CoV.
They may be the terminal host of the SARS-CoV-2 associated beta-CoV, similar to the beavers in SARS-CoV.
In future studies, it is important to identify or exclude several possibilities for the transmission of SARS-COV-2 from animals to human species.
First, bats may be the host of an almost identical SARS-COV-2-related virus.
Humans may share ecological positions with bats through slaughtering or coal mining.
Second, it may be one of the hosts of SARS-CoV-2's new invasion of the virus.
Humans are infected with the virus by slaughtering and eating wild food.
Many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to infection.
There's a need for antibody investigation of livestock and wildlife.
Thirdly, as noted above, SARS-CoV-2 may be reconfigured and adapted to the third species that have been exposed to bats and nails.
Research on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, the three main elements of the virus also play an important role in facilitating the passage of the coronary virus across the interplacing barrier.
First of all, they have a high mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the mutation rate of the coronary virus is estimated to be "medium" to "high", with an average replacement rate of about 10-4 times per year per site, depending on the stage of adaptation of the coronary virus to the new host.
The coronary virus has a proof-readable nucleic acid cut-off enzyme and its removal can lead to very high variability and decay, or even non-survival.
Interestingly, it is known that the remdesivir similarity can inhibit the reproduction of coronary viruses by suppressing this extraneous nucleic acid cut-off enzyme and RNA dependence RNA polymerase.
Red Seville is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of the coronary virus is about 1 million times higher than that of its host.
Also, if the coronary virus is not well adapted to the host, the mutation rate is usually high.
The SARS-COV-2 mutation rate is significantly lower than the SARS-COV with a high mutation rate, indicating that it is more adaptive to humans.
It's assumed that it's adapted to another host near the human race.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this applies to MERS-CoV.
Theoretically, genetic drift is unlikely to render vaccines and antiviral drugs against SARS-COV-2 rapidly ineffective.
Second, the larger RNA genome in the coronary virus has additional plasticity in the modulation of mutations and reorganizations, thus increasing the potential for inter-synchronous evolution, which facilitates the emergence of new coronary viruses when appropriate.
Evidence of this is provided by a large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions that are coded to the end of the genome's 3'.
Third, the coronary virus is randomly and frequently switching templates through a unique "copy selection" mechanism during RNA replication.
In the host as a hybrid container, chain exchanges occur frequently during the CoV RNA transcription.
The high homogeneity of the whole and subgenetic RNA can reorganise to produce a new coronary virus.
Systematic evidence of natural reorganisation was found in HcoV-HKU1 and HcoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronal viruses such as bats SL-CoV and bats CoV-HKU9.
Transmission-related virus-host interaction
In addition to the three virus factors described above, the interaction between the virus and the host receptor is another key factor influencing inter-species transmission.
This is a typical example of SARS-CoV reorganization, showing evidence of positive choice in inter-species transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis of separate strains of humans and beaver SARS-CoV, researchers believe that SARS-CoV can quickly adapt to different host communities, particularly through the mutation of S-protein RBD.
Normally, the RBD in the coronary virus S protein interacts with the cell receptor and is closely screened for host antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the 318 to 510 amino acids in S1 segment, which is combined with people ACE2 and its coreceptors to allow the virus to enter.
RSS-CoV's RBD identifies the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, beavers, rats and beavers, thus spreading the virus among the species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed in the RBD separate strains of humans and beaver viruses, 4 of which were in the receptor sequence of interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The presence of K479N and S487T mutations in the RBD of the fruit beaver SARS-CoV may increase the affinity of mutant protein interaction with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be vital to the adaptation of the virus to humans.
Notably, SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in the S-protein S1 unit is 30%, which means that the combination of S-protein and human ACE2 may have changed.
Indeed, a cold mirror study shows that this combination of affinity is 10 to 20 times higher than the one between ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other co-receptors are needed in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HcoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
In addition, there are many other HCOV receptors, such as HCOV-229E 's Ammonium enzymes N and HCOV-OC43 's 9-O-Acetic saliva.
They may also explain why these coronary viruses have successfully adapted to humans after spreading across animal hosts.
In addition to the cellular receptor, the results of HCOV inter-species transmission are influenced by other host dependency and restrictive factors.
The differences between these host proteins in humans and natural hosts such as bats, single-peak camels and rodents may constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
HCOV must deny host dependency and break host constraints in order to be successful in inter-species transmission.
In this regard, the molecular determinants of the important area of viral-host interaction have yet to be determined and demonstrated.
An unbiased whole genome screening of SARS-CoV-2 host dependency and restrictive factors using the latest CRISPR technology may yield results.
The emergence of a new HCoV: Back to its originals
The diversity of bat coronary viruses provides ample opportunity for the emergence of new HCOVs.
In this sense, the Bat Crown virus serves as a gene bank for HCOV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic reorganization are also drivers of HCOV evolution and two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coded genes could completely alter the form of the virus.
In SARS-CoV assisted proteins, because of the separation of SARS-CoV-related bat viruses, they were found to be able to encode different ORF8 proteins and therefore thought that ORF8 was important for adapting to humans.
At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 missing nucleic acid features of SARS-CoV were found in isolated strains.
This error divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered to facilitate adaptive mutation for host conversion.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have been reorganized with the alpha- and gamma-Cov spectrum, where a large number of smaller reorganization areas were found in RNA dependent RNA polymerases.
Reorganization points were also found in nsp9, most of the nsp10 and part of the nsp14.
Similarly, studies have shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has undergone inter-spectral reorganizations, which took place in single-climb camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, reorganization events were observed in other HCOVs, where HCOV and other animal coronary viruses were reconfigured in their non-structured genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may lead to unexpected changes in the genome of the virus, which may well be due to the reduction of selection pressures such as the host immune system faced by the virus.
An example of these effects is the absence of dual nucleic acid in the HCOV-229E prototype strain, resulting in the loss of the entire length of ORF4.
Although complete ORF4 can be observed in bats and camel viruses associated with HCOV-229E, the camel alpha-CoV shows individual nucleic acid insertion, causing mutation.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new HCOV is also driven by the pressure of storage host selection.
When bats are infected with a coronary virus, there are no symptoms or mild symptoms, indicating that coronary viruses and bats adapt to each other.
From anatomy and physiology, bats seem to be well adapted to coronary viruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the bats reaction have effectively reduced pathological changes caused by coronary viruses.
In addition, the natural anti-cell activity of bats is inhibited by the positive regulation of NKG2/CD94, and by the low level of expression of the main tissue compatible composite group I molecules.
Moreover, the high-level active oxygen (ROS) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats can both inhibit coronary virus replication and can be calibrated through the nucleic acid cut-off enzymes, thus providing selective pressure for high pathogenicity when strains enter the new host.
More pathogenic coronary strains may also evolve through reorganization, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein features to adapt to the host.
So it's no accident that three new HCOVs have emerged in the last two decades.
The coronary virus does not cause illness or slight symptoms in storage owners such as bats and camels.
They're extensive reproduction, and they don't cause a strong host immunization response.
That's why there's no-symptomatic carriers and serious human infections.
Severe symptoms are due mainly to the over-acting of the immune response and the cytological storm, so that the more immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, among the unsymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been decoupled from the coronary reproduction of the coronary virus.
The same strategy of delinking the immune response may play a positive role in the fight against SARS-COV-2 treatment.
The jammers in the bats are particularly strong.
Therefore, at least in the early stages of the human SARS-COV-2 infection, the use of I-type jammers should be beneficial.
In addition, there are deficiencies in the activation of NLRP3 in bats.
Based on this reasoning, the use of MCC950 to suppress NLRP3 inflammation may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme on which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were generated.
Although it has been found that bats with 95% nucleotide homogeneity with SARS-CoV are beta-coV, there is also a bat coronary virus with 96% nucleotide with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that the beavers and other animals in the market carry the same virus as SARS-COV, the direct intermediate host of SARS-COV-2 has not yet been identified.
So far, it has been discovered that the presence of zebra berth-coV, apparently the same source as SARS-COV-2, suggests that ceremonial cedar may be one of the middle hosts, or cerebium-coV may contribute to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there is still doubt, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was manufactured intentionally or unintentionally.
As a result of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the coronary virus has become the focus of attention.
Research on coronary viruses in bats and other animals has significantly changed our awareness of the origin of HCOV co-infection and the importance of host animals in human transmission.
There is ample evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through the middle host.
Given that SARS-CoV infections originate from exposure between humans and beavers on the market, closing the wet market and killing the beavers can effectively end the SARS epidemic.
Similarly, in view of the discovery of several spectrometers that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, the cross-colouring of bazooka-CoV should be removed from the wet cargo market in order to prevent the transmission of disease by humans and animals.
However, further research remains to be done on whether and how SARS-COV-2 is transmitted to humans through the presence of nails and other mammals.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed for a long time in a single-peak camel.
These camels are important vehicles and are the main source of local meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are spread across the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels to control meRS, following the Chinese wildlife market approach to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
In order to stop the re-emergent outbreak of MERS, integrated initiatives should be undertaken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels in conjunction with other infection control measures.
Because we can't get rid of these viruses, a new gene type may emerge, causing an outbreak.
Various human and animal coronary coronary viruses circulate in the wild environment.
In particular, there is a high diversity of bat coronary diseases.
These animals have many opportunities for evolution and reorganization of coronary viruses, which will make it easier to spread and/or kill new coronary viruses in humans in the future.
In some parts of China, the culture of eating wildlife should be abandoned in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
After the severe tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we should develop better prevention and response plans.
In fact, many viruses have been on Earth for a long time.
They stay in their natural host until there's an opportunity to spill.
Although bats have many characteristics conducive to the spread of the virus, human exposure to bats and other wildlife species will be greatly reduced if people are educated to stay away from bats and other wildlife species.
In order to gain a better understanding of the ecological state of the coronary virus and its natural host, continuous monitoring of mammals will be necessary and will prove very useful in preventing animal transmission to humans and future outbreaks.
In short, the most effective way to prevent viral human and animal disease is to keep human beings away from the ecological position of the natural host of the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is still missing from the mystery of the origin of the disease.
First of all, if bats spread an ancient SARS-COV-2 virus through mountain nails, it makes sense to look at the circumstances under which bats and nails can share the same ecological position.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how human contact with bats is yet to be determined.
Thirdly, if the third mammal is a true intermediate host, it must be clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and mountain nails.
Finally, since many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to SARS-COV-2, monitoring and experimental infection studies should be carried out.
In the case of bats, through nails or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical progeny viruses are expected to be found in natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will reveal the evolutionary path of SARS-COV-2 in animals, which is important for the prevention and control of human COVID-19.
There's a need to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" for COVID-19.
On February 6th, 2020, our team released the "Guide for Rapid Recommendations for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Infections of the 2019th-nCoV" which provides experience and lessons for the global response to the epidemic.
However, the coronary virus disease (COVID-19) is a new type of disease and, based on ongoing research and clinical practice, our knowledge of the disease is gradually increasing; therefore, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are constantly being updated.
In the present letter, we respond to an observation on the above-mentioned guidelines and provide updated diagnostic criteria for suspected cases and confirmed cases, based on the latest "COVID-19 Clinical Program" published by the National Health Council of the People's Republic of China (seventh edition).
In December 2019, 2019 new coronary virus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, which is now officially known as 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19), was named severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronary virus (SARS-COV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO (World Health Organization) listed COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
To counter SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a fast-track advice guide, which was posted online in the magazine Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
Since it was released, it has attracted a wide range of attention.
But note that COVID-19 is a new type of disease, and based on ongoing research and clinical practice, our knowledge of the disease is gradually increasing; therefore, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Council of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) issued seven editions of the "COVID-19 Clinical Program" between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have changed substantially.
Now, our guide has received comments from Zhou and others who, based on their clinical experience, have developed a simple rating scheme.
Their work provides new evidence for our guidance and valuable references to the global pandemic.
We acknowledge their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their proposals also need to be updated in the light of the latest "COVID-19 Clinical Program" and recent research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), a suspected case does require a combination of an epidemiological history feature and two clinical performances for a comprehensive analysis and, in the absence of a clear epidemiological history, three clinical manifestations:
Epidemiological history: (1) traveled or resided in communities where there were COVID-19 cases in and around Wuhan within 14 days prior to the onset of the symptoms; (2) in contact with SARS-COV-2 infections (positive for nucleic acid testing); (3) in contact with people with fever or respiratory symptoms in communities from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other reported COVID-19 within 14 days prior to the onset of the symptoms; (4) in contact with condensed confirmed cases (on a small scale within 2 weeks prior to the onset of the symptoms, 2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical performance: (1) Heat and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) visual characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) normal or reduced total white cell count in the early onset of the disease and reduced lymph cell count.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on a suspected case, with any of the following pathogenic or serometric evidence: (1) real-time PCR testing positive for SARS-COV-2; (2) the sequence of the entire genome of the virus shows high levels of coronary viruses known to be similar to the new type of coronary virus; (3) IgM antibodies and IgG anti-positive for the serum test for SARS-COV-2; or SARS-COV-2 antibodies for negative to positive, or an increase of drops in the recovery period by 3,4 times higher than the acute period.
As we can see, the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions added real-time PCR tests in respiratory or blood samples.
The fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions added blood sample pathology tests; then the seventh edition added serological evidence.
These modifications are based on the continuing work of researchers in studying the best nucleic acid test kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory specimens, including blood collection, which increase the availability of different samples and provide evidence for the inclusion of positive results of particular antibodies in the diagnostic criteria.
In addition, there is growing evidence to draw our attention to atypical symptoms and non-symptomatic patients.
Therefore, flow charts for Zhou et al. should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
In addition, the rating system needs to be validated in further clinical practice and research.
Finally, we want more direct evidence and call on readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of suspected cases and confirmed cases, we recommend reference and follow the latest guidelines of the country in which the cases are located.
Our team will also update our guide in time to help.
Bangladesh reported 5 new COVID-19 deaths, one-day high
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths.
It's a one-day death toll from the virus.
As of yesterday, 114 confirmed cases were recorded in Bangladesh ' s epidemiological, disease control and research (IEDR) reports, and 33 cases were cured after home rest.
17 cumulative deaths.
At an online press conference, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, head of IEDCR, stated that the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, there are two cases of persons over 60 years of age, two cases between 51 and 60 years of age and one case between 41 and 50.
She also said that two of the deaths were from Dhaka.

A hospital officer revealed to the local press Anadolu Agency that one of the deceased patients was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who had been treated at Kuwait Maitre Hospital.
On Saturday, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridge of Bangladesh, Obaidul Quader, announced via online video that public transport would be suspended beyond the original schedule and extended until Saturday.
The public transport stoppage started on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Essentials such as medical, fuel and food are still normally transported.
On 8 March, of the first recorded cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Bangladesh, two returned from Italy and one was the wife of one of the confirmed patients.
As of March 19, the three patients had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than a million infections globally
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the global total of SARS-CoV-2 coronary virus infections has exceeded 1 million on Thursday.
At least 52,000 deaths are related to coronary virus-induced diseases - COVID-19.
On the same day that milestone occurred, Malawi confirmed its first case of coronary virus infection and the first case of coronary virus-related deaths in Zambia.
North Korea declared that by Thursday it was one of the few countries not infected with the coronary virus.

In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronary virus have been recorded, resulting in at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News quotes data from Johns Hopkins University that on Wednesday, coronary virus infection killed over 1,000 people in the United States.
Throughout the world, countries have announced stricter measures to curb the spread of disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, extended the date of the city to 1 May.
President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russians throughout the country would continue to be paid for their work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and 1 against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfews in Al-Quds Al-Mukarramah and Medina to full-day curfews, which had been in effect only between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended the residence order until 1 May.
Australian shops have reduced the maximum amount of sanitary paper per transaction.
On Sundays and Saturday nights, Australia's chain stores Woolworths and Coles reduced the cap on each transaction of sanitary paper in all their stores to two bags and one pack, respectively.
Aldi also introduced a one-pack limit on Monday.
These restrictions are posted on the cash register or on Facebook pages of the chain.
It was reported that buyers accumulated goods for fear of COVID-19 in case they needed self-segregated.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limits the purchase of sanitary paper for delivery to each single package.
Prior to these changes, on 4 and 5 March, Woolworth and Coles introduced a four-package limit on each transaction.
In their press release of 8 March, Coles reported that after the imposition of the four-package restrictions, "many shops were still sold out within an hour of arrival" and called the demand "unprecedented", while Aldi called it "unforeseen" in his Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a Woolworth spokesman, sales increased "very sharply" last week.
Last week, the Costco store in Canberra also limited the number allowed to two.
In order to further alleviate the shortfall, Coles ordered greater packaging from the supplier and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional stocks and AlDI pre-positioned stocks for the planned Wednesday benefits.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director, Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers tried to increase their stocks, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times made this difficult.
He expected that production costs would rise and preferential activities would decrease as suppliers tried to meet demand.
On Tuesday, Aldi announced that after the early release of stocks, some shops would not be able to hold Wednesday special events.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, stated that stores were replenished every night.
He said that sanitary paper was a large item, that there was therefore fewer stocks and that once sold out, it would leave huge shelf space, increasing the perception of material shortages.
"Coles and Woolworths think that if there were many things on the shelf, goods like roll paper and handwashing fluids could be [attended] and in sufficient quantities, you might not panic so much." Russell Zimmerman said to ABC News.
Who Geves a Crap said last Wednesday they're out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures clean toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures soorbent toilet paper, stress that they are working all day long, weekends open to ensure supply.
The real estate website Domain.com reports that a number of real estate vendors will provide free toilet paper to the first bidder at the auction in Melbourne, as buyers spend less time on the weekends of the labour festival.
NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin City, contains eight pages of inserts in its Thursday edition, designed to be used as toilet paper after cutting.
According to ABC Australia, on 3 March, the store was initially reluctant to enforce the restrictions, and they said they had no plans to impose them.
Russell Zimmerman added that there was also a high demand for other commodities, including masks, hand washing fluids, dry goods, hand washing fluids and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to 2 packs, 12 volumes per package, on Sunday night.
World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the continuing outbreak of COVID-19 (diseases caused by the coronary virus SARS-COV-2) a pandemic.
While the term "epidemiology" refers only to the extent of the spread of disease and not to the degree of risk of a particular case, WHO notes the need to urge Governments to take measures:
"All countries/areas can still change the course of the pandemic.
If countries/regions test, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize their people as a response, "World Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreesus says...
" We are deeply concerned about the alarming levels of proliferation and severity and the alarming levels of inaction ... "
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He commented at CNN in February that, "With the exception of influenza, no respiratory virus has been found that continues to spread around the world after its emergence."
Ghebreesus expressed a similar view and said, "We've never seen a coronary virus-induced pandemic before."
He goes on, "Same thing, we've never seen a controlled virus pandemic before."
Before entering the new state of the pandemic, WHO identified the outbreak as an international public health emergency in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, said that the outbreak, "most importantly, it is still deteriorating."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
2019-2020 The coronary virus epidemic is a continuing epidemic of 2019 new coronary virus diseases (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The outbreak was confirmed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and as an epidemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, 210 countries and territories worldwide cumulatively reported approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases and approximately 97,000 deaths,
Healing about 36.4 million people.
China has a morbidity rate of about 4 per cent, while the global rate is between 0.08 per cent (New Zealand) and 13.04 per cent (Algeria).
Common symptoms include heat, cough and gas.
And possibly accompanied by complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The lurking period from exposure to onset is 2-14 days, usually about 5 days.
There's no vaccine or special antiviral treatment.
Clinical treatment is dominated by support treatment for symptoms. The preventive measures recommended include hand-washing, covering mouths when coughing, maintaining safe distance from others, surveillance and self-segregation of persons suspected of being infected.
Official agencies in various countries have taken measures such as travel restrictions, isolation, curfews, dangerous workplace controls and closure of facilities.
The epidemic has caused severe socio-economic shocks around the world, with the postponement or cancellation of sports, religion, political and cultural activities, while panic shopping has exacerbated the widespread supply shortage.
Worldwide, 193 countries and territories have implemented national or local suspension measures, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of primary and secondary school and higher education students.
There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other East and South-East Asian descent and physical groups and groups in regions with severe epidemics as a result of the online dissemination of false viral information.
However, reduced mobility and heavy industry closures have led to lower air pollution indices and reduced carbon emissions.
On December 31, 2019, the health department of Wuhan, China (Hungbei Province capital) notified an unknown case of pneumonia and launched an investigation in early January 2020.
The majority of these cases are related to the South China Sea Wholesale Market, so the new coronary virus is considered to be a common disease.
The virus that triggered the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, was a newly discovered virus closely related to bat-crowded viruses, mountain coronary viruses and SARS-CoV. The first patients found were later confirmed to have an outbreak on 1 December 2019, with no apparent link to a number of subsequent cases in the South China Seafood Market.
Of these early cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were confirmed to be related to the South China Sea Fresh Market.
On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning Post published an unverified report stating that the first case may date back to November 17, 2019, with 55-year-old males from Hubei Province. February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization reported a decline in new reported cases in China, but there was a sudden increase in newly reported cases in Italy, Iran and Korea, and for the first time, the number of new cases outside China exceeded its territory.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially minor cases.
As of February 26, the number of reported cases among adolescents was relatively low, with only 2.4 per cent of cases among young people aged 19 years and under worldwide. Patrick Valance, British chief scientific adviser, estimated that Britain needed about 60 per cent of its population to be infected with a new coronary virus in order to be immunized by an effective group.
The number of cases is the number of persons tested by COVID-19 who have confirmed positive results under official programmes.
As of March 23, the proportion of people tested in all countries of the world did not exceed 3 per cent of the total population, and many countries have issued official policies for people who do not detect light diseases, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
According to a study published on 16 March, as of 23 January, an estimated 86 per cent of the COVID-19 infections in China had not been detected, and the unrecorded infections were 79 per cent of the recorded cases.
According to a statistical analysis published on March 30, the actual number of infections in Italy is far greater than the number of reported cases.
The basic transmission (R0) of COVID-19 was initially estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the Center for Disease Control in the United States suggests that R0 could be 5.7.
Most of the COVID-19 patients can recover.
The period between the onset of illness and death is 6-41 days, 14 days most common.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 people died in COVID-19.
As at 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of deaths in China were among persons over 60 years of age, 75 per cent of deaths were accompanied by basic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics on deaths in COVID-19 are usually reported as deaths with positive results under official programmes.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may well exceed the statistics, as it may not include patients who have not been tested, such as those who have died at home, in sanatoriums, etc.
Part of the data from Italy shows that the actual number of deaths during the epidemic is four to five times higher than the number of deaths of new coronary virus pneumonia in official statistics.
A female spokesperson for the United States Center for Disease Control and Control (CDC) said, "We know that the [published death toll] is lower than the actual number," and rumours that the United States data are underestimated support this statement.
On 1 February, the first deaths outside China occurred in the Philippines, and on 14 February, the first deaths outside Asia occurred in France.
As of February 28, there were more than a dozen deaths outside China in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and territories on all continents other than Antarctica had reported deaths. There were several methods used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary from region to region, and will vary over time and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as the quantity of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment programmes, the first outbreak and age, gender and overall health status. Death rates are the result of the number of deaths divided by the number of persons diagnosed during the given period.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate was 6.0 per cent as of April 10, 2020 (97,039/1,617,204).
Death rates vary from region to region.
In China, the estimated death rate fell from 17.3 per cent (1 January 2020 to 10 years) to 0.7 per cent (1 February 2020 to 1 February 2020) and other measures included case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR), which reflected the number of deaths as a percentage of those diagnosed, while the latter reflected the number of deaths as a percentage of those infected (including those diagnosed and undiagnosed).
These statistics are not time-bound and are tracked from infection to case resolution for a particular population group.
Many scholars try to calculate these data for specific groups of people.
The evidence-based medical centre at Oxford University estimated the overall rate of infection mortality in the epidemic to be between 0.1 per cent and 0.39 per cent.
The upper estimate for this range is consistent with Germany ' s first random test of COVID-19 and a statistical analysis study of the effects of the detection on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization claims the epidemic is manageable.
The height and ultimate duration of the outbreak cannot be determined and vary from region to region.
Maciej Boni, from Pennsylvania State University, says, "If not controlled, outbreaks of infectious diseases usually start to stagnate when the existing host is exhausted and then begin to slow down.
But it's almost impossible for us at this point to predict when the drop point will appear. "
China's Senior Medical Adviser, Chung Namshan, believes that if all countries mobilize to adopt the World Health Organization's recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus, "June can be expected to end the epidemic".
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 could explode again and again for a period of one to two years. "
A study led by Neil Ferguson at the Imperial Institute of Technology showed that "before the vaccine is put into service (which may take 18 months or more), it is essential to take physical distance and other measures.
William Schaffner from Vanderberg University said, "This coronary virus is highly contagious, and I think it's unlikely to disappear completely," and "may evolve into a seasonal disease, which erupts once a year."
Re-emerging pathologies depend on group immunisation and mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-specific, and some of the infected may be unsymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory fluids, loss of smell, gasp, muscle and joint pains, throat pain, headaches, cold, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhoea or hysteria. According to the World Health Organization, about one sixth of patients turn to severe illness and suffer respiratory difficulties.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) lists respiratory difficulties, persistent chest pains or stress, sudden confusion, difficulty in sensibilizing and bruised face or lips as an emergency symptom; if these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is recommended. ... Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, infectious shock and death.
Some infected persons may be unsymptomatic and have no clinical representation, but the test results are positive, so researchers recommend close observation and examination of the close contact of the diagnosed patient to exclude the possibility of infection.
China estimates that the rate of non-symptomatic infections varies from very low to 44%.
Incubation periods (the time interval between infection and onset) are generally 1-14 days; 5 days are the most common. With regard to uncertainty, one example can be found: the percentage of patients with loss of smell among COVID-19 patients was initially estimated at 30 per cent, then reduced to 15 per cent.
Some details on the path of transmission of the disease have yet to be determined.
The disease is currently thought to spread mainly through close contact and coughing, sneezing or speaking; proximity contact is within 1-2 metres (3-6 feet).
Studies have found that open cough can cause the most far-frozen transmission of foam 4.5 m (15 ft) - 8.2 m (15-27 ft).
It has also been suggested that a longer stay in the air as people speak can also lead to the spread of the virus. Although the virus usually cannot be transmitted through the air, it can also occur when people breathe or speak.
It could fall on the mouth and nose of people around it and even get sucked into the lungs.
Medical procedures such as tube intubation and cardiopulmonary recovery (CPR) can cause the aerosolization of respiratory tracts, which can lead to air transmission.
Also, if a person touches the surface (including the skin) contaminated by the virus and then touches his nose and nose, it can cause the virus to spread.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through manure, but this risk is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 excreta. The virus was most contagious three days before the onset of the disease, but also before and after the onset of the disease.
Positive results can be detected at the earliest three days before the onset of the disease, indicating that the new coronary virus was contagious before the symptoms became apparent.
Despite the low number of reported cases of non-synchronous cases diagnosed in laboratories, some countries have detected cases of non-symptomatic infections in the course of a person-to-person follow-up survey.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Control (ECDC) has indicated that although the spread of the new coronary virus is not yet fully clear, it is generally transmitted by one person to two or three people. The duration of the virus's survival on the surface of the object varies from hours to days.
Specifically, the new coronary virus is known to survive on plastics (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, on cardboard for one day and copper for up to four hours.
However, the time of survival is also influenced by humidity and temperature. There are cases of pets and other animals COVID-19 testing positive.
There is no evidence that animals will re-infect the virus to humans, but official British agencies recommend that people wash their hands after exposure to animals, just as they have been exposed to the surfaces of other people who may have been infected.
Severe Acute Respiratory Console 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new type of virus that was first separated from 3 patients with pneumonia in a group of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All features of this new SARS-COV-2 virus are present in the natural coronary virus. Before the virus enters the human body, it can be killed with domestic soap, because the soap can dissolve the virus's protective capsule. SARS-COV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-COV.
It's now considered a common disease.
Genetic analysis shows that this coronary virus is genetically clustered with a beta coronary virus belonging to Sarbecovirus and two bat-origin strains.
The consistency of the new coronary virus with the samples of other bat coronary viruses (BatCov RatG13) at the level of the whole genome is 96%.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that only one amino acid was missing from some parts of the genome of the virus in the mountain nails and the virus in the human body.
To date, full genome comparisons have found a maximum of 92% of the same genetic material between the mountain crown virus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that the mountain cape is the middle host.
Whether the virus is infected can be diagnosed initially on the basis of symptoms, but eventually it can be determined by reversion of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected secretion.
A comparison of PCR and CT studies in Wuhan shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but the properties are lower and many imaging features overlap with other processes of pneumonia and disease development.
As of March 2020, the American Radiology Society suggested that "CT is not suitable for screening COVID-19 or as the first test to diagnose the disease."
The World Health Organization has now published a number of nucleic acid testing programmes for SARS-COV-2, the first of which was released on January 17.
The nucleic acid test uses real-time reversion of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Respiratory or blood samples can be used for detection.
It's usually a matter of hours to days.
In general, this is done by snorting and also by swabs. Many laboratories and companies are developing serology tests for antibody testing.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests had been confirmed to be sufficiently accurate to allow widespread use.
In the United States, serology tests developed by Cellex have been approved for use by certified laboratories only in emergency situations.
The typical imaging features of patients' X films and computer fault scans (CTs) include extra-week grinding glass asymmetrical and chestless cavity fluids.
The Italian Radiology Society is compiling an international online database on the image performance of confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other viruses (e.g., gland viruses), images that have not been confirmed by the PCR have limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China comparing the results of chest CT to those of the PCR found that although images were less specific to the identification of infection, detection was faster and more sensitive and could therefore be considered as a screening tool in the epidemic area.
An artificial intelligence-based rolling neural network has been developed that combines X films and CTs to detect the image features of the virus.
Measures to prevent the spread of the disease include good hygiene practices, hand-washing, avoidance of unwashed contact with the mouth of the eye and nose, coughing or sneezing, covering of the nose with a paper towel and dropping it directly into the trash can.
A suspected infected person should wear a medical surgical mask when entering a public place.
It is also recommended that measures be taken to maintain physical distance to prevent the spread of the virus. Many Governments have restricted or advised that travel to and from the affected countries and regions is not necessary.
However, the virus has now reached the stage of community transmission in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community, where some community residents have no idea where they are or how they are infected.
The Government ' s use of mobile phone location data for tracing purposes has raised privacy concerns, and more than 100 organizations, such as Amnesty International, have issued statements calling for restrictions on such monitoring.
Various mobile applications are being used or introduced for voluntary use. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on solutions with privacy protection features, such as the use of bluetooth to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
Once users have been in close contact with patients who have been positive for COVID-19 tests, they receive a reminder of the continued spread of misinformation about the prevention of infection; for example, washing noses and squiding mouths with mouthwash is ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, but many organizations are actively developing it.
It's recommended to stop the spread of the disease by washing hands.
The U.S. CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially in the back of a toilet or when there's a visible stain on their hands, before dinner and after snotting, coughing or sneezing.
It's because the virus can destroy its protective cylindricals by using domestic soap before entering the body, thereby killing the virus.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) also recommends using at least 60% of alcoholized handwashing fluids if there is no soap and running water around it.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands.
The surface of the object can be disinfected with a variety of solutions (disinfection is effective within one minute of the surface function of stainless steel), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium perchlorate, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% polyketone iodine.
Other solutions (e.g. benzachlor ammonium and chlorinated glucose acid) have less effect.
U.S. CDC recommends that all regions should be desterilized if new cases of coronary virus pneumonia or confirmed cases occur in facilities such as offices or day-care centres, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablet computers, touch screens, keyboards, remote control devices and patient-used ATMs.
WHO recommends that people cover their noses with bending elbows or paper towels while coughing or sneezing and immediately dispose of all contaminated paper towels.
It is recommended that a suspected infected person wear a medical surgical mask because wearing a mask reduces speech, sneezes and coughs, and shortens the distance of transmission.
The World Health Organization has issued a note on the use of masks and methods.
Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, argues that "the wearing of a mask reduces the tendency of people to touch their faces, which is also a major source of infection in the absence of adequate manual hygiene." In addition, it is recommended that the person responsible for caring for persons suspected of being infected wear a mask.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that a healthy population need a mask only in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for caring for the COVID-19 patients, although the organization also recognizes that a mask helps to avoid touching the face.
Some countries and regions have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends wearing non-medical masks made of fabric. China explicitly recommends that healthy citizens also wear one-time medical masks, especially when they are in close contact with others within 1 metre (3 feet).
Hong Kong, China, proposes to wear masks when travelling on public transport or when entering a crowded area.
Thai health officials recommend that people make their own masks and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia strictly prohibit access to public places without masks or masks ...
On March 16, Viet Nam asked everyone to wear a mask in order to enter a public place in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires all persons to wear masks to enter the grocery store.
Israel demands that all residents wear masks in public.
Taiwan, China, has produced 10 million masks per day since mid-March, starting on April 1, demanding that it be required to travel on trains and inter-city buses.
Panama makes it mandatory to wear a mask and recommends homemade masks for residents who cannot afford them.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
The prevention and control measures relating to maintaining social distance (also known as physical distance) of infection are designed to minimize close contact between people and thereby slow the spread of the disease.
Measures include segregation; travel restrictions; suspension, suspension and closure of stadiums, theatres or shopping malls.
In terms of social distance, measures that can be taken by individuals include staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding access to crowd-intensive areas, using non-contact methods of greeting and physical distance from others.
Now, many governments have forced or advised the regions affected by the epidemic to remain socially distant.
With regard to the size of the largest crowd, the initial recommendations of the United States Government agencies and WHO were 250 people (in areas without COVID-19 transmission), which were quickly reduced to 50 and then to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two persons. Older persons and groups suffering from basic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and impaired immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness and complications. German CDC recommended that such populations in the epidemic area be kept as far away as possible. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health agencies began replacing the term "social distance" with "physical distance" to clarify that the aim was to reduce physical contact while maintaining social contact, including virtual and long-distance links.
The use of the term "social distance" implies a requirement of complete social isolation and does not encourage alternative ways of maintaining people-to-people connections. Some authorities have also issued sexual health guidelines applicable during the pandemic.
The recommendations include sexual relations with a partner who lives alone and is not infected with the virus or without symptoms.
COVID-19 is recommended for self-segregation between diagnosed patients and suspected infected persons.
Health institutions have issued detailed information on proper self-segregation. Many Governments have imposed or recommended self-segregation for the entire population of the affected areas.
The strictest self-segregation instructions were also issued to high-risk populations.
If there is a possibility of contact with a COVID-19 patient, or if he has recently been to a country or area of widespread transmission, he will be advised to separate himself from the time of eventual exposure to the virus for 14 days.
Epidemic prevention and control strategies include containment/constraint and mitigation.
Containment applies to the early stages of an outbreak, with the aim of tracking and isolating infected persons, together with other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to other populations.
If the spread of the disease is no longer contained, efforts should be made to make the transition to the mitigation phase: measures should be taken to slow the spread of the disease and reduce its impact on the health system and society ...
Containment and mitigation measures can be undertaken simultaneously.
Repression requires more extreme preventive measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic regeneration to below 1. Part of the effort to control the outbreak of infectious diseases is to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is, as we know, the levelling of epidemiology.
This reduces the risk of collapse of health service systems and provides more time for the development of vaccines and treatment programmes.
Non-drug interventions that can contain the epidemic include individual preventive measures such as maintaining hand hygiene, masking and self-segregation; community measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as suspension of schooling and the cancellation of mass gatherings; community actions aimed at encouraging acceptance of and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning. In the face of a significantly increased epidemic, China immediately adopted stricter measures to curb the epidemic, such as sealing cities and imposing strict travel bans.
Other countries and regions have taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The Republic of Korea has introduced large-scale screening and partial isolation measures and has issued warnings about the movements of infected persons.
Singapore provides financial support to self-segregated infections and imposes a huge fine on those who refuse to separate themselves ...
Taiwan, China, has increased its mask production and imposed penalties on suppliers of medical supplies sold in storage. Simulations in the United Kingdom and the United States show that both mitigation (which slows but does not halt the spread of the epidemic) and containment (which reverses the spread of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak health needs by two thirds and reduce the number of deaths by half, but may still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Depression may be the preferred measure, but it needs to be maintained until the virus stops spreading among the population (or until the vaccine is introduced, whichever comes first), otherwise it will quickly rebound once the measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions aimed at containing the pandemic have social and economic costs.
No special effects antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but research and development is ongoing, including testing of existing drugs.
Imposing an off-prescription cold medicine, rehydration and rest can help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the condition, oxygen, intravenous fluid and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids could cause a deterioration.
Several compounds previously approved for treatment for other viral diseases are being studied to determine their suitability for treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also notes that some "traditional and family therapy" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
According to the World Health Organization, improving processing capacity and adapting the medical system to meet the needs of the COVID-19 patients is a basic response to the epidemic.
ECDC and the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe issued guidelines for hospital and primary health-care services for the transfer of resources at multiple levels, including the concentration of laboratory services in COVID-19 testing, the elimination of selective procedures where possible, the segregation and isolation of COVID-19 positive patients, and the enhancement of intensive care capacity by training personnel and increasing the number of available respirators and beds.
There's a lot of speculation about the origin of the first case (the so-called zero patient).
The first known case of coronary virus pneumonia may date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In one month, the number of new coronary virus cases in Hubei Province has gradually increased.
Most of these patients are related to the South China Sea Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, a theory that the new coronary virus originates in one of these animals; or, in other words, that it originates in a common disease of humans and animals. On December 26, the first doctors at the Central West Hospital in Hubei Province discovered and treated an unknown number of pneumonia patients, and in December 27 reported to the disease prevention and control centre in Jianghan District, Wuhan City.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "Sars-like coronary virus".
Eight doctors, including Li Wen-Ling, were instructed by the police for spreading rumours, while another doctor, Eiffen, was warned by his superiors for ringing alarms.
The Wuhan City Health and Health Board subsequently issued an announcement on December 31 and reported to the World Health Organization.
An investigation was launched in early January after the Wuhan Health Department received numerous reports of cases of undisclosed pneumonia.
From early January to mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China as a result of China Spring Festival population movement and Wuhan as a transit and main railway hub.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new confirmed cases in one day, including 2 cases in Beijing and 1 case in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people had experienced symptoms as at 20 January 2020. As at 26 March, more cases had been diagnosed in the United States than in China and Italy, making it the country with the largest number of confirmed cases worldwide. As at 9 April 2020, cumulative global reports had accounted for more than 1.61 million cases; more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 cures.
About 200 countries and territories around the world have reported confirmed cases.

It was not until March 18, 2020 that the British Government began to apply various forms of social distance-keeping or mass isolation measures against its citizens.
The British Government has thus been criticized for its lack of speed and strength in responding to public concerns.

On the other hand, China ' s assistance was well received in Latin America and parts of Africa. 2 April, the World Bank launched an emergency support initiative for developing countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) commended the Chinese authorities for their efforts in preventing and controlling the epidemic.
The World Health Organization has noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SAR epidemic and the current crisis. In the SAR epidemic, the Chinese authorities were accused of concealing the facts and impeding prevention and containment, while in the current crisis, the central government "has begun to update the situation regularly before the New Year's holiday to avoid panic."
On January 23, in response to the decision of the central Government to implement the closure measure against Wuhan, the representative of the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, although "it certainly was not a recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO), it also "reflected the determination to contain the spread of the epidemic from the areas where the epidemic is concentrated" and described it as an "unprecedented public health" initiative. On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak of a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), the sixth public health emergency of international concern since the introduction of the measure for the first time during the swine flu pandemic in 2009.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tandessai, pointed out that the identification of public health emergencies of international concern was based on "global transmission risks, especially to low- and middle-income countries with inadequate health systems".
In response to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tandessai stated that "there is no reason to take measures to interfere unnecessarily with international travel and trade" and that "the World Trade Organization does not recommend restrictions on trade and mobility".
On 5 February, the World Health Organization appealed to the international community to contribute $675 million to fund the strategic readiness of low-income countries, stating that there was an urgent need to provide support to countries that did not have an accompanying system for testing people infected with the virus.
Tandesser further issued a statement stating that "the weakest link determines how powerful we are" and urging the international community to "involve immediately, otherwise it will be even more costly." On February 11, at a press conference, the World Health Organization decided to name the disease as COVID-19.
On the same day, Tandessai stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to "the United Nations will do everything in its power to respond to the epidemic".
To this end, the United Nations launched the United Nations Crisis Management Group to coordinate the United Nations response as a whole. The World Health Organization has stated that it can "focus on the health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to respond to the wider social, economic and development impacts of the epidemic".
On 14 February, a joint mission to China led by the World Health Organization (WHO) was launched to send international and World Health Organization experts to China on the ground, to assist in responding to the local epidemic and to assess the severity and contagion of the disease through seminars and meetings with key national institutions, and to assess the impact of "provincial and county response activities, including the different situations in urban and rural areas". On 25 February, WHO announced that "global efforts should be made to prepare adequately for a possible coronary virus pandemic" and noted that, although it was too early to call the pandemic, countries should be "ready".
In response to the growing epidemic in Iran, the World Health Organization sent a joint mission to the country to assess the situation.In February 28, World Health Organization officials claimed that the global risk level of the coronary virus epidemic had been raised from "high" to "high" , which was the highest level of alert and risk in the methodology.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the Health Emergency Project of the World Health Organization, warned in a statement: "It's a real check of global governments: wake up.
The virus may be approaching, please be prepared, and urge governments to take the right response to avoid the worst-case scenario on the planet.
Ryan further stated that current data were not sufficient to allow public health officials to declare their entry into the global pandemic, which would mean that " we basically recognize that all people on Earth may be exposed to the virus."
On March 11, the World Health Organization declared that the outbreak of the new coronary virus constituted a global pandemic.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) called "Expressing deep concern at the depth of the spread and severity of the epidemic and the reality of inaction." The World Health Organization was severely criticized for its perceived mismanagement of the global pandemic, including delays in the declaration of public health emergencies and the classification of the virus as a global pandemic.
Some of the strong objections included a petition for the resignation of the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom, which, as at 6 April, had been signed by 733,000 people.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Group notes that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions, and that the Government should assume this responsibility.
The expert group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against specific groups.
The expert stressed that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minors, older persons, internally displaced persons, the homeless, groups living in extremely harsh conditions, detainees and refugees and other unidentified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are actively responding to the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform aimed at providing timely and comprehensive information and views and recommendations on policy responses worldwide.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to address the impact of the embargo and mobility restrictions, this number includes a national policy tracking system designed to help countries learn from each other and to promote a global partnership to address the challenges of the new coronary virus.
As the pandemic first erupted in Hubei Province, China, the United States, the British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Goff and the son of Brazilian President Yail Bossonaro, Eduardo Bossonaro, criticized the Chinese Government ' s approach.
Several CCPC provincial administrators were removed from their posts for improper handling of the epidemic in China, reflecting central dissatisfaction with the response of local political institutions to the epidemic.
According to some commentators, this was intended to avoid public dissatisfaction with the Central Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a result of the outbreak of the new coronary virus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijeng, denied the earlier recognition that the outbreak of COVID-19 began with Wuhan and supported the conspiracy theory that the new coronary virus pneumonia originated in the United States or Italy.
United States President Donald Trump called the new coronary virus a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" and called China's "censorship system" to exacerbate the spread of the virus and turn it into the current global pandemic", which, in turn, was perceived by some critics as a form of racial discrimination and "dissipated the concern that its government has failed to contain the virus".
The Daily Beast received a telegram from the Government of the United States outlining a communication strategy apparently issued by the National Security Council, which states: "It's all about China.
We have been told that in any way, including press conferences and television appearances, this message can be disseminated as far as possible "politics", "foreign policy" and the media such as the Bloomberg Society claim that China's assistance to the affected countries is intended to promote its global reach.
The EU Foreign Policy Officer Josep Borrell warned that there was a "geopolitics factor for influence through good offices and generous politics".
Borrel also said, "China, unlike the United States, is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called on the United States to lift the sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and allegedly provided assistance to the latter two countries.
On April 3, 100,000 masks donated by Maun to Cuba were blocked by United States sanctions.
The U.S. authorities have also been accused of transferring aid to other countries.
There are also reported masks disputes between Germany, Austria and Switzerland and other countries, such as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey intercepted hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticized the EU for its lack of support for Italy affected by the new coronary virus.
The Italian Ambassador to the European Union, Maurizio Massari, said: "Only China has responded bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity. "
On March 22, Russian President Putin, following a conversation with Italian Prime Minister Kont, arranged for Russian troops to send military doctors, special disinfectors and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper quotes an anonymous high-ranking political official, saying that 80% of Russia's aid is of little use to Italy.
The source accused Russia of launching the "Geopolitics and Diplomacy" charisma campaign.
The Governor of Lombardi, Attilia Fontana, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Maio, rejected the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "[Putin], in providing assistance to his American colleagues, believes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials resume production, they will pay back if necessary."
The NATO "defendant 2020" military exercise planned for Germany, Poland and the Baltic Sea is the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the cold war and will be downsized.
Kate Hudson, Secretary-General of the nuclear disarmament movement, criticized the "Guardant 2020" exercise: "In the face of a global public health crisis, the exercise endangers not only the lives of the United States and many European countries participating in the national army, but also the inhabitants of the country in which the exercise takes place." "The Iranian government is seriously affected by the epidemic, with approximately 24 members of parliament and 15 other current or former politicians infected.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders requesting assistance. The letter stated that United States sanctions against Iran had prevented Iran from gaining access to international markets and made it difficult to combat the epidemic. The outbreak prompted calls on the United States to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child health care, paid family visits and improved public health funding.
Political analysts predict that the epidemic could have a negative impact on Donald Trumpâs ability to be re-elected in the presidential elections of 2020. Foreign relations between Japan and South Korea have also deteriorated as a result of the global pandemic.
Japan declared that all persons entering from Korea were subject to a two-week quarantine at a government designated location, and it then criticized Japan for the vague and passive nature of the quarantine measures.
Korean society initially showed a polarized attitude to the Presidential response to the crisis in Cao.
Many Koreans signed the petition, some called for impeachment, accused the government of mishandling the epidemic, and others praised his strategy. The pandemic prompted many countries to adopt emergency legislation as a response.
Some commentators are concerned that this might increase government control over power.
In Hungary, the Parliament voted in favour of Prime Minister Olban Victor ruling indefinitely by decree, suspending Parliament and elections and punishing people found to have disseminated false information about the virus and the management of the government crisis.
The multiplicity of supply shortages can be attributed to the outbreak of the new coronary virus, resulting from the increased use of equipment, panic shopping and the disruption of factory and logistics operations in the global response to the epidemic.
The United States Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption of supplies.
There was a high incidence of panic shopping, leading to the emptiness of essentials such as food on shelves, sanitary paper and bottled water, resulting in a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry has been warning of delays in the delivery of electronics.
According to the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tandessai, the public demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand resulted in a 20-fold increase in the price of such products compared to the usual maximum and a delay in the supply of medical supplies by 4 to 6 months.
The World Health Organization warned that this would pose a threat to medical personnel.
In Australia, the pandemic provides new opportunities for buyers to sell Australian products to China.
This activity led to a shortage of baby formula powder in supermarkets, which was then banned by the Australian Government.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of and illegal trade in key products have been very successful and have averted serious food shortages, while Europe and North America are expected to experience such problems.
Agricultural production in northern Italy has not declined significantly, but industry representatives are of the view that prices may increase.
The emptying of food shelves is only temporary, even in Wuhan, and Chinese government officials have released pork reserves to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Italy has similar legal provisions requiring food producers to supply stocks for such emergencies.
The damage to the global economy has already affected China: a media report on 16 March stated that, in the first two months of 2020, the Chinese economy was hit by a huge shock and retail sales fell by 20.5 per cent.
Since mainland China is the main economic and manufacturing centre in the world, the virus outbreak is seen as a major threat to global economic stability.
Agathe Demarais of Economist Intelligence predicts that the market will remain unstable until there is a clearer understanding of the possible consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the negative impact of the outbreak on global economic growth could be greater than the 2002-2004 SARS.
An expert from the University of Washington, St. Louis, estimated that the impact of the epidemic on the global supply chain would amount to over $300 billion, which could last for up to two years.
According to reports, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was in a difficult position after the sharp drop in oil prices due to falling demand from China.
On February 24, the global stock market fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On 27 February, as a result of growing public concern about the new coronary virus epidemic, various United States stock indices, including the NASDAQ 100 index, the Standard & Poor 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, showed the largest drop since 2008, with the dots falling by 1,191, the largest single-day drop since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
The three indices fell by 10% or more that week.
On February 28, Scope Rainings GmbH confirmed China ' s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
People's concerns about the new coronary virus caused the stock market to collapse again, with the biggest drop occurring on March 16.
People think the recession is a general event.
The economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the central banks and the states for taking timely and urgent measures.
The central bank reacted faster than the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the industries most affected by the travel ban, the closure of public places such as tourist attractions and government advice to avoid the impact of travel.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to declining demand, including British Airlines, China Eastern Airlines and Australian Airlines, while British feeder Airlines Flybe was unfortunately shut down.
The cruiser industry has suffered more than ever.
Many railway stations and ferry ports have also been forced to close.
The epidemic coincided with the spring season in China, which was supposed to be an important tourist season.
National and local governments cancelled a series of events involving crowds, including the annual Spring Festival, and private enterprises closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Disneyland in Shanghai.
Many New Year ' s agricultural events and tourist attractions, including the Beijing Palace and traditional temples, were cancelled and closed to prevent mass crowds.
In China ' s 31 provinces, 24 municipalities and autonomous regions extended the New Year ' s leave to 10 February, requiring most enterprises not to resume work before that date.
These areas account for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong, China, raised the level of its response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, suspended schools until March, and cancelled the New Year celebrations. Retail trade was affected globally, and shop hours were shortened or temporarily closed.
Retail outlets in Europe and Latin America dropped 40%.
Retail outlets in North America and the Middle East fell by 50-60 per cent.
In addition, the epidemic caused shopping malls to have a 33-43 percent drop in passenger traffic in March compared to February.
Additional measures have been taken by shopping centre operators around the world, such as additional sanitation facilities, the installation of heat scanners to measure the temperature of shoppers, and the cancellation of some activities.According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the economic downturn caused by the pandemic may result in an extremely poor population of 14 to 22 million more in Latin America than in the absence of the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the Wuhan epidemic, there were approximately 5 million people unemployed in China.
China has nearly 300 million peasant workers, many of whom are held in homes in inland provinces or in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans were unemployed and applied for government assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the new coronary virus epidemic could cause 47 million people to lose their jobs in the United States, and unemployment could reach 32%. Indiaâs blockade has led to the unemployment of tens of millions of (daily paid) Indian farmers.
In the second half of the month, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for universal benefits. Nearly half a million German companies used a government-subsidized time-working system for their employees.
France and the United Kingdom have also adopted the German Compensatory for Time Work.
The performing and cultural industries have also been severely affected by the epidemic, with organizations operating globally, as well as employees and individuals employed.
Artistic and cultural industry organizations strive to uphold their mission (usually funded by the Government) to demonstrate cultural heritage to the community, preserve the safety of their employees and the public, and provide support to artists wherever possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, venues and other cultural institutions around the world had been closed indefinitely to varying degrees, and the original exhibition, events and performances had been cancelled or postponed.
In response to this situation, efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The epidemic has also recently led to the cancellation of many religious services, major sporting events and other social events (such as concerts, concerts, technical seminars and fashion shows) and a rapidly increasing negative impact.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations to be held in Rome during the last week of Christian Pentecostal.
Many parishes recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend mass on Sundays; some churches conduct worships via radio, live webcasts or television, while others allow worship in cars.
Christian pilgrims were not seen on St. Peter ' s Square, and other religious groups cancelled or restricted their worship or limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and pedagogues as a result of the closure of their large and small churches in Roman Catholic parishes.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas and the subsequent closure of the holy sites, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their residents from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the worst damage to the world sports agenda since the Second World War.
Most of the major sports events were cancelled or postponed, including 2019-20 European Leagues, 2019-20 British Super Leagues, 2020 European Leagues, 2019-20 NBA seasons and 2019-20 All-American Hockey Federation seasons.
The outbreak disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, scheduled to take place at the end of July; on 24 March, the IOC announced that the event would be "rescheduled beyond 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021." Casinos and other playgrounds around the world were closed, and the field poker competitions were delayed or cancelled.
This, in turn, has led many gamblers to gamble online, and several online gambling websites have reported a significant increase in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected by the suspension or cancellation of concerts by various music groups.
A lot of big theatres, like Broadway, have suspended all performances.
Some artists have also sought to continue to create and share their works via the Internet in lieu of traditional live performances, such as live concerts or the creation of a network of festivals for artists to perform and publish and promote their works.
On the Internet, many of the web-based obsessives on the theme of the new coronary virus are spreading, and at a time of growing uncertainty, many people are beginning to turn to humor and distraction.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, xenophobia and racial discrimination have increased against Chinese, East Asians and people from Europe, the United States and other hotspots.
Fear, suspicion and hatred have emerged in many countries and regions, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
The many reports of February this year, when most cases were still confined to China, documented the racist feelings of different groups around the world towards Chinese, who believed that they should be infected with the virus or subjected to so-called legitimate reprisals.
Some African countries have also experienced an increase in anti-China sentiment.
It has been reported that many residents of Wuhan and Hubei regions have suffered geographical discrimination.
Both online and online, there are voices that support the Chinese and residents of the most seriously affected areas.
As the epidemic spreads to other hotspot countries, Italy became the first country in Europe to have a serious outbreak of COVID-19, and people from that country may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and other citizens initially signed a petition to ban Chinese from entering the country in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, #ChinaDontComeToJapan (China don't come to Japan) has been widely debated on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States report increasing racial abuse and attacks.
US President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the new coronary virus a "Chinese virus", and critics have argued that there is racial discrimination and anti-Chinese tendencies in his speech.
Ukrainian protesters attacked a bus from Wuhan to New Sanzari containing Ukrainian and foreign evacuees.
Students from north-eastern India (on the border with China) and attending major cities in India are also reported to have been harassed by the outbreak of the new coronary virus.
The president of the Indian People ' s Party West Bengal, Dileep Gosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature, "so God will avenge them."
These statements were later denounced by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta as "wrong." In China, xenophobia and racial discrimination against non-Chinese residents were also exacerbated by the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign garbage" and should be the target of "waste disposal".
Many newspapers with a pay-for-wall removed the pay-for-wall restrictions for some or all of the new coronary virus reports.
Many scientific publishers have published scientific papers on the epidemic.
Some scientists have also chosen to share their findings quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

2019 Laboratory tests for respiratory coronary disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-COV-2 viruses include detection of the presence of the virus and the emergence of antibodies after detection of infection.
RT-PCR detects the RNA of the coronary virus and determines whether the virus exists in the sample.
The test is SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It can be used to determine whether there is a recent infection or whether there is an active infection.
Antibody testing (sero-testing) can be used for diagnosis and group monitoring.
Antibody testing shows how many people have contracted the virus, including those with mild symptoms who have not been reported or without symptoms.
This test determines the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunization of the population.
Due to the limited number of tests, as of March 2020, no country/area had been able to provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among its population.
As at 23 March, no country/area had more than 3 per cent of its population tested, and there were significant differences in the number of countries/areas tested.
Such differences may also seriously affect reported case mortality rates, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Real-time reversible polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing using throat swaths will only be completed within the first week of infection.
Normally, within hours and 2 days, the results will be available.
RT-PCR testing using swabs can only be completed within the first week of infection.
After that, the virus disappeared in the throat but continued to reproduce in the lungs.
For those infected during the second week after infection, the sample may be replaced by a deep-absorbent extract obtained through a straw, or cough (spill) may be used.
In January 2020, RT-PCR was released at CharitÃ© Hospital in Berlin, which is one of the early PCR testing methods and serves as the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 23, 2020, a test method was developed in the United Kingdom. On January 28, 2020, Korea company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical class based on the PCR's SARS-CoV-2 test box (PowerChek Coronavirus).
In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain approval from the National Drug Control Authority of China for the urgent use of the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing kits. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed 2019 new coronal viruses (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resources Department.
The early version of the test kits uses three genetic methods, one of which is uncertain due to reagent deficiencies, while the CDC in Atlanta has a detection bottle; this resulted in an average of fewer than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The two-part test method was not found reliable until February 28, 2020, when the state and the local laboratory were allowed to start testing.
This test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Control Authority on the basis of an emergency use authorization.
LabCorp announced that COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR could be conducted nationwide from March 5, 2020.
Queest Diagnostics similarly announced that it would provide a nationwide COVID-19 test from March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limits were announced; sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests are developed and produced by the National Research Centre on Vitrophysics and Biotechnology (VECTOR).
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered with the Russian Federation ' s Health Supervision Authority. 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a reagent box for detecting COVID-19 infections. 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA for a test method that could complete a large number of tests within 3.5 hours, thus enabling a device to conduct approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, FDA issued emergency authorization (EUA) for testing using the Abbott m2000 system to Abgott; FDA previously issued similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Science.
On March 21, 2020, an approximately 45-minute Cepheid test was also authorized for emergency use by the FDA.
The FDA has approved a test method to replace PCR with temperature-enhanced technologies such as nucleic acid.
Since the method does not require a series of warming cycles, positive results can be obtained in only 5 minutes and negative results can be determined in 13 minutes.
In the United States, where there are about 18,000 such devices, Abbott is expected to increase production so that 50,000 tests per day can be provided. Taiwan is developing a test method for using monoclon antibodies (specifically combined with the new coronary virus's N shell protein) in the hope that it will provide results within 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid influenza test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "in the early stages of the virus, the diagnostic value of the vertebrae was small, and the performance of the CT [computer swam] may be obvious, even before the symptoms appeared."
Typical features of CT include double lung filamental glass shadow, with extra-week asymmetrical and lateral cloths.
As the disease progresses, it will develop sub-pleacy, gravel pathology and lung mutations.
A study of PCR and CT comparing Wuhan (where the current pandemic began) shows that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, but CT is less accurate and many of its visual features overlap with other pneumonia and disease.
As of March 2020, the American Radiology Society suggested that "CT should not be used for screening COVID-19 or as a first-line detection tool for diagnosing COVID-19." Starting in March 2020, CDC recommended using PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect individual infections about seven days after the onset of the symptoms in order to determine the immune status of the monitored population.
The high flux automated systems in many clinical laboratories can perform these measurements, but their availability depends on the productivity of the systems.
For CLT, although the immune response can be tracked by a sequence sample, it usually uses an extra-week blood sample.
For PoCT, skin piercing is usually used to get a blood sample.
There is no need to execute extraction steps before testing, unlike the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, FDA approved testing methods declared by 29 entities that are now able to distribute their anti-medical test kits.
As of April 7, 2020, FDA approved only one test under emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Omon Medical Experimental Diagnostics Inc. and Epitop Diagnostics test kits were approved in Europe for the detection of viruses in blood samples, IgG and IgA antibodies.
Hundreds of samples can be detected within hours of detection capacity, and therefore much faster than conventional PCR tests for the detection of the virus RNA.
Normally, 14 days after the beginning of the infection, antibodies could be detected.
The UK NHS announced that it was piloting a home-based programme to detect suspected cases, which would eliminate the risk of infection of patients when they went to hospital and would eliminate the risk that ambulances would have to be disinfected once they were used.
In Germany, on 2 March, the National Association of Medical Doctors for Legal Health Insurance indicated that non-residential institutions had the capacity to conduct approximately 12,000 tests per day and 10,700 tests the previous week.
If the tests are carried out at the request of a doctor, the costs are borne by health insurance.
According to the director of the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, the total weekly detection capacity in Germany is 160,000.
As of March 19th, free drop-out tests had been provided in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of persons tested in Germany was unknown, as only the number of persons who reported positive results was reported.
An initial laboratory survey showed that, as of the 12th week of 2020, at least 483,295 samples (including 12th week of 2020) had been tested and 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent) had been detected. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a methodology for the simultaneous detection of 64 patient samples, that is, the aggregation of samples and further testing only when the combined samples were found to be positive. In Wuhan, the Big Genome (BGI) temporarily set up a 2000 flat rice emergency detection laboratory called Fire Eye, which was put into use on 5 February 2020 and could handle more than 10,000 samples per day.
The laboratory was built five days under the supervision of the founder of the great genes of China and modeled to show that, without the above-mentioned detection capability, the number of cases would be 47 per cent higher in the north of the lake, and the corresponding cost of treating isolation would be doubled.
Immediately after the Wuhan laboratory, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai set up fire-eye laboratories, which are now being established in 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the daily flux of laboratory tests totalled 50,000 per day. Origami Assays published open-source, multi-circuit design, allowing COVID19 testing of up to 1122 patient samples by 93 tests alone. These balanced designs can operate in small laboratories without the need for automatic fluid transferers.
As of March, the shortage and insufficient quantity of reagents had become an obstacle to large-scale testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some of the sponsors to explore the sample preparation programme, which involved heating samples to 98 Â°C (208 Â°F) for up to 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. The United Arab Emirates announced on 31 March that new coronary viruses had now been tested for more of its population, more than in any other country, and that testing levels were being expanded to allow large numbers of people to be tested.
The method of achieving this detection capability is, on the one hand, to use the drive-through test and, on the other hand, to finance the creation of high-volume laboratories to respond to the detection needs of large-scale populations by the Group 42 and Hua Daegen (based on its fire-eye emergency testing laboratory in China).
The laboratory was built in 14 days and was able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, the world ' s first laboratory of this size operating outside China.
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, China, Japan and the United States have developed different testing methods for various parts of the coronary virus gene map.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German method of producing test kits for sending reagent boxes to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own reagent boxes.
The German method was published on January 17, 2020; the program developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States of America was used only after January 28, thereby limiting the ability of the United States to detect it. Both China and the United States encountered problems with the reliability of test kits in the early stages of the outbreak, and these two countries and Australia were unable to provide enough test boxes to meet the needs and the recommendations of health experts.
In contrast, experts believe that extensive testing in Korea has helped reduce the spread of new coronary viruses.
Thanks to the testing capacity established by the Korean Government over the past few years, it is concentrated in private sector laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programmes as the best way to slow the development of the COVID-19 epidemic. Wide distribution of the virus has led to a very high demand for testing, which has resulted in a backlog of hundreds of thousands of tests in private United States laboratories, and the supply of swaps and chemical reagents has begun to strain.
In March 2020, China reported on the accuracy of its test box.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC were "defective"; the government subsequently removed bureaucratic barriers to private laboratory testing.
It explained that the inaccurate results could have been caused by the incorrect collection of samples or the erroneous use of test kits.
The Spanish Cabinet has indicated that the reagent boxes returned to the error results will be recovered and replaced with another reagent box provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test boxes purchased by the Czech Republic from China were incorrect. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test boxes from China and found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister MatoviÄ suggested that these test boxes should be thrown into the Danube. AteÅ Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health stated that the test boxes purchased by Turkey from China were "highly faulty" and did not "use them."
Positive results can be obtained by testing and isolating persons who have tested positive and tracking the history of exposure of SARS-COV-2 positive persons.
Researchers working in VÃ², Italy (the first case in Italy of covid-19 deaths), conducted two rounds of testing of a group of approximately 3,400 people, each of which was about 10 days apart.
About half of them detected positive and non-symptomatic, and all the cases found were isolated.
New infections were completely eliminated by imposing travel restrictions on communities.
By means of large-scale tracking of contacts, restricted entry travel, detection and isolation, 2020 coronary virus transmission in Singapore was much slower than in other developed countries/areas, and Singapore did not take extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many activities were cancelled in Singapore and residents were advised to stay home on March 28, but the school resumed on time on March 23 after the holidays.
Several other countries/areas, such as Ireland and the Republic of Korea, have also managed to contain the epidemic by tracking contacts on a large scale, restricting access travel, detection and isolation, and less aggressive closure measures.
A statistical study found that the lower the case mortality rate in countries with more detections than the number of deaths, perhaps because those countries were better able to detect only mild or non-symptomatic groups.
WHO recommends that countries with no detection capability and limited experience in handling COVID-19 in national laboratories send their top five positive and top ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for validation.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the "positive %" column is influenced by the country's testing policy.
In other cases, the rate of positive detection is higher in countries where only inpatients are tested compared to countries where all citizens (whether symptoms or not) are tested.
Hand-washing, also known as hand cleaning, is a hand-cleaning act to remove dust, grease, micro-organisms or other useless substances from the hands.
Persistence of handwashing with soap at certain "critical moments" every day can prevent the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which can be transmitted through manure.
If people do not wash their hands before they touch their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous), they may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or common flu.
Five critical moments in a day when the hands must be washed with soap: before and after cessping, after cleaning the buttocks of children or changing diapers, before feeding children, before eating and before or after processing food, before and after processing raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
In the absence of soap and water, hands can be cleaned with grass and ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands in the following cases:
Before, during and after the food.
Before and after taking care of the patient.
After changing diapers or cleaning the buttocks of kids.
Snout, cough or sneeze.
Touching animals, animal food or animal faeces.
The manual hygiene of medical personnel refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before the delivery of the drug or medical care prevents or minimizes the spread of the disease.
In the medical field, the main purpose of hand-washing is to remove pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other micro-organisms that cause disease) and chemical substances that may harm humans or cause disease on their hands.
Handwashing is particularly important for people involved in food processing or working in the medical field, but it is also very important for the public.
The health benefits of hand-washing include minimizing the spread of influenza, coronary viruses and other infectious diseases; preventing communicable diarrhoea; and reducing respiratory infections;
And to reduce the infant mortality rate at home.
A 2013 study showed that the improvement of hand washing practices has contributed slightly to the increase in height of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by advocating simple behavioural changes (e.g. hand washing with soap).
This simple act can reduce the death rate of these diseases by nearly 50%.
Promoting hand-washing as an intervention can reduce the incidence of approximately one third of diarrhoeal incidents, with the effect of providing clean water in low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap can reduce diarrhoea by 48%. As spontaneous behaviour in families, schools and communities around the world, handwashing with soap is the most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhoeal and acute respiratory infections.
Pneumonia, as a major acute respiratory infection, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, and pneumonia kills about 1.8 million children every year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause nearly 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to the United Nations Children ' s Fund (UNICEF), compared to any single vaccine or medical intervention, the transformation of handwashing with soap before meals and after toilets into deep-rooted habits can save more lives, reduce diarrhoeal deaths by almost half and acute respiratory infections by one quarter.
As part of the Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project, there are usually other hygiene interventions along with hand washing.
Washing hands can also prevent the spread of haemorrhage through direct physical contact.
Washing hands can have a slight adverse effect, i.e. frequent hand washing can lead to dry skin, resulting in skin damage.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand-washing can lead to skin itching, hysteria, known as humid rashes or hand skinitis, which is particularly common among health-care workers.
Excessively frequent hand-washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of forced disease.
In order to reduce the spread of disease, it is essential to wash hands with soap in five critical moments of the day: after toilet (e.g. urination, defecation), after cleaning the buttocks of children (replacing diapers), before feeding children, before eating and before or after processing food or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, hands should also be washed in the right way in the following cases: before and after the incision or wound; after sneezing, coughing or snoting; after touching animal faeces or handling animals; and after touching garbage ...
In many countries/regions, the proportion of hands washed with soap is low ...
A study of hand-washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7 per cent of households had the highest proportion of hand-washing habits with soap. A study in 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate, 97 per cent; the United States was close to the average, 77 per cent; China had the lowest, 23 per cent. There were now several behavioural change methods in place to promote hand-washing with soap at critical times. In order for children to have their hands washed, developing countries could choose to have children in school do so collectively on a daily basis.
The Basic Health Care Plan introduced by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of a large-scale initiative to improve children's health and education.
At the core of this national plan is deworming twice a year, supported by daily hand-washing with soap and brushing with fluffy toothpaste.
In Indonesia, the plan was successfully implemented.
Integrating soap or detergents into the water would better remove micro-organisms from the skin.
The main role of soap and cleaners is to reduce the barriers to solubility and to increase solubility.
Water alone cannot be used effectively to clean skin because fats and proteins (parts of organic soil) are not soluble in water.
But cleaning your hands requires reasonable water ...
Solid soap, which can be reused, may retain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies investigated the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap and concluded that bacteria could not be transferred because bacteria could be washed out by foams.
But DC still claims that "it's best to use non-contact liquid soap."
Anti-bacterial soap has been widely promoted in a healthy public.
So far, there is no evidence that a recommended antibacterial or disinfectant has been used to select antibiotics resistant micro-organisms in nature.
However, antiviral soap contains common antibacterial agents such as trichlorfon, which has a large strain of resistant micro-organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistance strains were not chosen, antiviral soap might not be as effective as propaganda.
In addition to surfactants and skin detergents, complex formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, anti-bad blood acid, emulsion acid), antibacteric beryllic acids, and more dermal modulators (amerium, vitamins, mintol, plant extractors). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the University of Oregon School of Public Health shows that common soap is the same effect in the prevention of disease and in the removal of bacteria from hands as consumer consumer-grade anti-bacterial soap containing trichlors.
The hot water washes hands comfortably, but the heat is not enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria thrive at the temperature of the body (37Â°C).
However, in the removal of natural fats containing soil and bacteria, the water of hot soap is more efficient than the water of cold soap.
Scientific research has confirmed that the use of hot water has no effect on the reduction of microorganisms on hand, contrary to the prevailing view.
A non-water-based hand-cleaning fluid or a non-bacterized hand-washing fluid is a non-water-based hand-cleaning agent.
At the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the twenty-first century, non-water-based alcohol hand cleaners (also known as alcohol rubbing fluids, non-breeding hand fluids or non-washing hand fluids) were popular.
Most of these hand-washing formulations contain isopropanol or ethanol, then add thickening agents such as carpium (propyl acid polymer) to form gels, or add moist agents such as glycerine to form liquids or foams to make them easy to use and ease the skin drying caused by alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide will further increase antibacterial activity.
Alcoholic hand rubbing can kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory comb virus (RSV), nose virus, cow pox, flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
The alcohol content of 70% of the alcohol is used 30 seconds later to kill 99.97% of the bacterium on the hand (a reduction of 3.5 orders of magnitude, similar to a reduction of 35 minutes), a reduction of 99.99% to 99.9999% (4 to 5 levels of magnitude) on the hand in 1 minute. Free wash is most effective for the bacteria and slightly less for some viruses.
Alcoholic hand rubbing is almost totally ineffective against viruses such as the virus (norovirus, also known as Novak, Norwalk) (the most common cause of gastrointestinal inflammation). Adequate non-washing handwashing or alcoholic hand rubbing must be used to completely wet or cover both hands.
Washing hands and backs, between fingers and at the end of all fingers for about 30 seconds until liquids, foams or gels dry.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that it is better to wash hands rather than use unwashed hands, especially when it looks dirty.
These hand rubbing fluids are increasingly used because they are easy to use and can quickly deactivate micro-organisms; however, they should not be a substitute for proper hand washing, unless there is no soap or water available.
The frequent use of alcohol free handwashing fluids can cause dry skin unless the formulation is accompanied by a lubricant and/or a wet-painting agent.
Glycerine and/or other lubricants may be added to the formulation to reduce or eliminate alcohol-induced skin drying ...
In clinical trials, alcohol-free hand-washing fluids containing lubricants can significantly reduce the incidence of skin irritation and skin drying compared to soap or antibacterial detergents.
Allergies to skin inflammation, exposure to ale-measles syndrome or allergies to additives in alcohol or alcohol palate are rare.
The low likelihood of irritation of irritative dermatitis induced by alcohol-free hand washing compared to the use of soap and water is a reason for its attractiveness.
Waterless cleaners, while effective, do not remove organic substances from their hands, but only disinfect them.
Therefore, unwashed hand-washing fluids are less effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens than soap and water, as these pathogens are still in hand.
The efficacy of alcohol-free handwashers depends to a large extent on the composition and formulations, which have historically been much worse than alcohol and alcoholic hand rubbing fluids.
Recently, formulations using benzachlor ammonium have been proven to be persistent and cumulative antibacterial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to have reduced effects after repeated use, possibly due to a gradual adverse skin reaction.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and can use grass ash or earth instead ...
Straw ash or earth is better than washing hands alone, but not as soap.
One of the problems is that if soil or grass ash is contaminated by micro-organisms, then the spread of the disease may be accelerated rather than slowed.
Like soap, grass ash is a disinfectant because it can form alkaline solution after water.
WHO suggests that if no soap is available, it can be replaced with grass ash or sand.
The correct hand-washing approach recommended by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States to prevent the spread of the disease is as follows:
Wet hands with flowing hot water or cool water.
It's recommended to use current water because of the possibility of contamination of the titanium basin, which seems to have little to do with temperature.
Use a sufficient amount of soap to rewash to create foam, while cleaning the backs of hands, fingers and nails.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap rather than using water alone.
At least 20 seconds.
Washing produces friction, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, the longer they wash, the more bacteria.
Clean it with flowing water.
Washing hands in water can cause re-pollution.
Dry it with a clean towel or dry it naturally.
Thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers and nails are the most neglected parts.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish may hide microorganisms.
The use of wet milk is usually recommended to avoid drying hands; dry skin can cause skin damage, thereby increasing the risk of infection transmission ...
Where tap water and/or soap are not available in developing countries, low-cost measures may be available to facilitate hand-washing, for example, by pouring water through a floating barrel or puncture, and/or using grass ash (where necessary). Hand-washing programmes, such as simple taps and other low-cost means, may be used in situations where water supply is limited (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries).
The technique of a simple tap is to hang a can with a rope and then pour a small amount of water through a pedal onto your hands and then use soap.
The effective drying of hands is an important step in the process of manual hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective methods of doing things in public health.
More and more studies have shown that paper towels are healthier than electric dry phones provided in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Tisse Symposium in the paper towel industry, comparing paper towels, warm dry phones and more modern spray dry phones with hygiene levels.
Washing hands and drying hands with warm wind dry phones shows an average increase of 194% in the total amount of bacteria on the fingers and 254% in the total amount of bacteria on the palms.
The average amount of bacteria on the fingers increased by 42 per cent, and the average number of bacteria on the palm increased by 15 per cent.
Wash your hands and wipe your hands with paper towels, with an average reduction of 76% in the total amount of bacteria on your fingers and 77% in the total amount of bacterium on your palm. Scientists have also conducted tests to determine whether various dry hands can cause cross-infection among other bathroom users and bathroom facilities.
Sprayed dry phones allegedly eject air at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 miles per hour) capable of blowing off micro-organisms on their hands and on their bodies, which could contaminate other bathroom users and bathroom facilities within 2 m.
A warm wind dry phone can spread micro-organisms beyond the dry cell phone at 0.25 meters.
The results of the dry hands with paper towels showed no serious microbiological transmission. In 2005, TÃV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to assess different dry hands.
The following changes in bacterial levels were observed after dry hands:
The study involved a number of different dry cellular producers, comparing these dry phones with handkerchiefs.
In the absence of soap and water, during travel, you can choose to wash your hands with a sterilized hand towel.
Alcohol should have at least 60% of the amount of handwashing fluid.
Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor, found in 1846 that handwashing was effective in preventing the spread of disease in hospitals, but after a long time, medical personnel were forced to wash their hands.
Hospitals use electronic devices that provide feedback to alert hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
One study found a decrease in the infection rate following the use of these equipment.
The medical staff must wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, using a sufficient amount of soap and water or gel to produce foam and wash their hands.
Hands on each other's fingers.
If there's any residue between the nails, you can clean it with a hard brush.
Since the residual moisture on hand may still be bacterial, it must be fully cleaned and dried with clean towels.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the tap (if necessary, paper towels open the exit door).
This prevents the re-pollution of the hand by contacting these surfaces.
In health institutions, hand washing is aimed at eliminating pathogenic microorganisms and avoiding their spread.
Reports in the New England Medical Journal indicate that in most medical settings hand washing is still not acceptable and that a large number of medical personnel often forget hand washing before contacting patients, leading to microbiological transmission.
One study showed that proper hand-washing, coupled with other simple procedures, could reduce the blood flow infection rate associated with the catheter by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization published a sheet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-washing methods in medical institutions.
The organization also posted a draft manual health guide on its website for public comment.
Whitby et al. gave an overview.
If there is a need to verify regulatory compliance, then commercial equipment can be measured and verified by the counterparty ' s health.
The World Health Organization suggested five moments to wash hands:
After contact with blood/body fluid
Before and before the sterile operation.
Add antibacterial chemicals to soap after taking care of a patient.
In an environment where antibiotics are available before or in which there is a large number of micro-organisms before the operation is performed, it may be necessary to carry out this microbicide operation.... When the hands are "washed" for the operation, there must be a tap that can be opened and closed without contact, a handwash containing chlorine self-determined or iodine, a sterile towel that is then washed for drying hands, a rinseless brush and other sterile means of cleaning the nails.
All the jewelry has to be removed.
This program requires the washing of hands, the forearm up to the elbow, usually 2-6 minutes.
It doesn't take long to wash (10 minutes).
When washing, the water on the forearm must be prevented from flowing back into your hands.
After washing your hands, dry your hands with sterile cloths and put on surgical clothing.
In order to reduce bacterial transmission, it is advisable to wash hands before and after contact with a patient or to use non-bactericidal washers.
In order to control the vine bacterium infection in hospitals, it has been found that the best benefit of cleaning hands is very limited when the frequency of washing hands is 20 per cent and the frequency of cleaning hands is 35 per cent or more.
Compared with the use of anti-bacterial soap, the use of common soap for hand-washing results in a more than three-fold increase in the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food. Comparison of hand-washing with hand-washing with anti-bacterial soap (30 seconds each) shows a lower rate of bacterial infection using alcohol-skinning hand-skinning than anti-bacterial soap 26%.
However, the reduction of the H1N1 influenza (HI1N1 influenza A) virus and the hard-to-recognize bacterium (Clostridium difficile spores) is more effective than alcohol-smoking hand fluids. The physical hygiene of medical institutions can be improved by training employees in hand-washing, increasing the availability of alcoholic hand rubbing fluids, and interventions such as written and verbal reminders.
Further research is needed on which interventions are most effective in various medical settings.
In developing countries, hand-washing with soap is considered an important cost-effective tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap or hand-washing facilities in people ' s homes, schools and workplaces poses a challenge to universal hand-washing.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, even if there is a cheap way to build a handwashing table, the presence of a handwashing tap in every private bathroom or near a public health room is very rare.
However, the low frequency of hand washing may also be due to deep-rooted habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating the use of soap to wash hands can influence policy formulation, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavioural changes in the population.
If it's gonna work, it's gonna have to be monitored and evaluated.
A systematic assessment of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing hand washing rates in low- and middle-income countries and that social marketing activities were less effective. An example of a UNICEF-promoted "tristar approach" to hand washing in schools that encouraged schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, the school can rise from one star to the top three stars.
Hand-washing outreach activities could include the construction of hand-washing stations to reduce disease and child mortality ...
Another example of hand-washing awareness activities is World Washing Day, which seeks to effect behavioural change. As a result of the 2019-20 coronary virus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the use of a hand-washing face symbol.
Few studies have examined the relationship between the overall cost-effectiveness of hand-washing and the avoidance of disability-adjusted life years (DALY) in developing countries.
However, reports indicate that advocating hand-washing with soap is more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The first to recognize the importance of handwashing for human health â especially for those who are weak (e.g. mothers who have just given birth in hospitals or wounded soldiers) â were two pioneers in the field of hand-held health in the mid-19th century: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, Founder of Modern Care.
At that time, most people still thought that the infection was caused by the stench known as poison.
The outbreak of food-borne diseases and medical-origin infections in the 1980s prompted the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be more active in advocating manual hygiene, emphasizing manual hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of infection.
The 2009 outbreak of swine flu and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect people from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, the "right hands-washing" poster will be displayed in public health, office buildings and the bathroom of the airport.
The verse "Snap off" means that someone says he doesn't want to be responsible for something or to be involved in something.
It's from the Bible Matthews, and Bentius Pilate washes his hands after deciding to crucify Jesus, and then turns into an extensive verse in some English-speaking groups.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth began to force her hands to wash the stains of her imagination, showing that she felt guilty about what she had done and encouraged her husband to do it.
Studies have shown that people who think of or envisage immoral behaviour often wash their hands more frequently than others and tend to value their handwashing facilities.
Moreover, those who can wash their hands with the idea of immoral behaviour are unlikely to engage in other "purification" compensatory actions, such as volunteering.
Religion requires hand-washing for sanitary and symbolic purposes. The symbolic hand-washing of hands without soap is part of many religious symbols of hand-washing, including Baha ' i faith, Hinduism, ablution (tevilah) and hand-washing (netilat yadayim), hand-washing in Christianity, and small cleanness in Islam. Religion and hygiene, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam demand to wash their hands behind the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require hand washing before and after meals.
COVID-19 Workplace Control
COVID-19 Control in the workplace refers to the prevention of coronary virus disease using hazardous occupational safety and health measures
The soundness of hazardous workplace control depends on the specific workplace and work assignment and should be determined on the basis of risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of the vulnerable individuals who may be exposed to COVID-19.
As required by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure risks work is least exposed to the professions of the public and other colleagues, and it is therefore recommended that basic infections prevention measures be taken, including manual washing, encouraging staff to be segregated from their homes after illness, adherence to respiratory protocol and routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium-exposure risk work includes work requiring regular or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients who may be infected as a result of ongoing community transmission or international travel.
Including staff who come into contact with the general public, such as schools, high population density working environments and some large retail environments.
In addition to the basic prevention of infection, the group should use high-efficiency air filters and sneeze protection devices to ventilate, wear personal protective equipment and take other risk control measures in contact with the COVID-19 patient.
OSHA believes that there is a high risk of exposure for medical and paramedical staff who are in contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients, and that exposure risks are very high if staff members perform an aerosol-producing operation with known or suspected COVID-19 patients or collect or process specimens from them.
Hazardous control measures applicable to such personnel include engineering controls, such as pressure vents and personal protective equipment suitable for their work.
COVID-19 outbreak could have serious effects in the workplace.
Staff members may be absent due to illness, need to take care of others or fear of exposure.
Business models may also change, including changes in demand for commodities or in access to them (e.g. shopping at non-peak hours, or the use of distribution or offload delivery services).
Finally, product logistics from the severe regions of the COVID-19 epidemic could be disrupted.
These plans address the levels of risk associated with various workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors from family and community environments and risk factors for self-employed workers, such as older persons or groups with chronic diseases.
The plans also outline the prevention and control measures needed to respond to these risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Infectious disease prevention and response plans may need to be guided by national or local advice.
Targets for responding to outbreaks include reducing staff transmission, protecting populations at higher risk of ill health complications, maintaining operations and minimizing adverse impacts on other entities in the supply chain.
In addition, the response will be affected by the severity of the disease in the enterprise ' s community.
Hazard control level is a widely used framework for occupational safety and health, which is used to group risk control measures according to their effectiveness.
If the COVID-19 hazard cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective control measures are engineering control, followed by administrative control and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering control means separating employees from work-related hazards rather than relying on their behaviour, which is also the least costly solution to implement.
Administrative control means a change of work policy or procedure requiring the staff member or employer to act on its own initiative.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) has less control than engineering control and administrative control, but helps to prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE shall be selected according to the level of risk to which the staff member is exposed, as applicable (e.g., respirators) and must always be properly worn, regularly inspected and maintained, replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
Under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure work has the least occupational exposure to the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended that all workplaces take basic preventive measures of infection, including hand-washing, that sick workers be segregated from their homes, that they be subjected to respiratory protocol when coughing or sneezing, that they provide paper towels and garbage cans, that they be prepared for telecommuting, that they be prevented from using other people ' s tools and equipment when necessary, and that they maintain daily cleaning and disinfection in the workplace.
The timely identification and isolation of potentially contagious individuals is key to the protection of workplace personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States recommends that employees who exhibit acute respiratory symptoms should be separated from their homes for at least 24 hours until it is determined that there is no heat, heat and any other symptoms, and that sick leave policies should be implemented flexibly, allowing staff members to stay home to care for sick family members, and should be clearly informed of the policy.
According to OSHA, the risk of moderate exposure includes work that requires frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients within 6 feet (1.8 m) but may cause individuals to become infected with SARS-COV-2 as a result of continuous community transmission near the workplace or as a result of possible recent visits to the COVID-19 epidemic area.
This category of staff includes staff working in schools, high population density work environments and a number of large retail environments exposed to the general public. Engineering controls for this group and high-risk groups include the installation of efficient air filters, improved ventilation effectiveness, the installation of physical barriers, such as transparent plastic sneezing protection devices, and the installation of exit-free windows to provide customer services. Administrative controls for this group and high-risk groups include encouraging home-based isolation of sick staff, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, establishing fault-shift shifts, eliminating non-essential travel to the COVID-19 outbreak site, developing emergency communications plans, including forums to respond to staff questions, providing staff with up-to-date education and training on the risk factors and protective behaviour of COVID-19, training staff in the use of protective clothing and protective equipment, providing personnel in need of protective clothing and equipment, and providing training in the use of protective equipment, providing resources and working environments that will help to improve personal hygiene, requiring manual washing, limiting access to customers and the public, and posting signs on hand-washing and other COVID-19 protective measures.
It's best for this type of staff to have a respirator.
In the event of illness on board an aircraft, appropriate protective measures should be taken to protect staff and other passengers, including placing the patient beyond 6 feet from other passengers, assigning a crew member to serve the patient, providing a mask to the patient, or requiring the patient to cover his nose and nose with a paper towel while coughing or sneezing.
The crew shall wear a one-time medical glove while caring for sick travellers, touch fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces ... In case of heat, continuous coughing or respiratory difficulties, the crew shall also wear additional personal protective equipment.
Gloves and other one-time items should be treated in biological hazard bags, followed by clean-up and disinfection of contaminated surfaces. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, dangerous control measures also include delayed travel in the event of illness. In the event of heat or other symptoms on board, self-segregate and immediately notify the medical room on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up visits should take place in the compartments of isolated persons ... For schools and childcare facilities, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control recommend that, if the infected person has been present in school, the corresponding school and childcare facilities be closed for a short period of time and completely cleaned or disinfected, regardless of the proliferation in the community ...
For medium- and low-level community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancellation of field visits, rallies and sports classes, other large gatherings such as choirs or cafeteria meals, increased distance between desks, false peaks and departures, restrictions on non-essential visitors and separate health offices for children with influenza symptoms.
In cases of severe community transmission, consideration may be given, in addition to a social distance strategy, to extending the suspension of classes. For law enforcement officers carrying out routine routine activities, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control considers that they face lower immediate health risks.
It is recommended that law enforcement officials who must contact CIVID-19 who identify a patient or suspected individual should act in accordance with the same level of protection as emergency medical technicians, including with appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during the arrest, the staff member shall first clean and disinfect his or her belt and equipment before it can be used with household cleaning spray or rag before it is used, and shall comply with standard personal protective equipment sealing and disposal procedures as well as clothing sealing and cleaning procedures.
OSHA believes that certain health care and dormitory workers are exposed to high or very high exposure risks.
Staff at high risk of exposure include medical care, support, laboratory and medical transport staff with physical access to persons known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes extremely high if staff perform a wave-generation procedure for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, or collect or process specimens of infected or suspected infected persons.
Frozen processes include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchial mirrors, some dental procedures and examinations, or body cavity specimen collection.
The staff of the high-risk morgue include staff involved in the preparation of the bodies of the deceased, who were diagnosed or suspected in the lifetime of COVID-19, and the higher risk of exposure in the event of autopsies performed. Additional engineering measures for this risk group also include isolation cells for COVD-19 for confirmed or suspected cases, including during the execution of the fly-promotion procedure.
Some health-care facilities and morgues can also be equipped with specialized negative ventilation systems.
The specimens should be handled with biosafety level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients be given different waiting areas depending on whether the patient is a suspected COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Authority also recommends that personnel working within 6 feet of a patient known or suspected to be infected with SARS-COV-2 and those performing the fumigation process wear a respirator.
The United States requires the use of N95 filter masks or better masks approved by NIOSH in the context of comprehensive documented respiratory protection programmes such as health testing, training, medical examinations, etc.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and improve staff comfort. WHO does not recommend protective clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that is not transmitted through body fluids.
WHO recommends that screening agents at entry points wear only medical surgical masks.
WHO recommends the use of medical surgical masks, glasses or masks, robes and gloves for staff who need to collect respiratory specimens from patients with COVID-19 and provide care or transfer services to patients without having to carry out the fume-generation procedures.
Medical surgical masks must be replaced with N95 or FFP2 masks if we want to perform a wave-generation program.
In view of the inadequate global supply of PPE, WHO recommends that the need for PPE be reduced through physical barriers such as telemedicine, transparent windows, direct care personnel only be allowed to enter the rooms of patients with COVID-19, only when PPE is necessary for a specific mission, the same respirators continue to be used in the care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, the monitoring and coordination of PPE supply chains and the discouragement of the use of masks by non-symptomatic personnel.

Since this month, we have had some difficult situations.
In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, we have clearly felt the shared destiny of all humanity and have recognized our responsibilities to each other.
We face unprecedented challenges, but we are well aware that the best response to such challenges requires a sense of solidarity, partnership and community building around the world, which is the core philosophy of Wikipedia.
The e-mails, telephones and chats that convey friendship and care among all colleagues are ample proof of the difference between our colleagues and how fortunate we are to work with you.
I'm so grateful and proud to be with you all.
Last week, we were commended for our work.
They made me realize how meaningful it is that the world can use Wikipedia at this moment, and at the same time that this vital resource is a symbolic force for people around the world to keep functioning properly.
Whether your job is to run the website, pay for it or be safe in the community, Wikimedia can't function without your hard work.
The world needs information from Wikipedia more than ever.
At this stage, the content of our work, and indeed the way it is done, will have an important impact on the world.
In view of the importance of this mission and the heavy responsibilities of our colleagues, we will make some important adjustments to our collaborative approach starting next week.
Modus operandi and timetable adjustments
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the executive team met last night to discuss the way the company worked and the timetable for the next few days to months.
At the meeting, we considered what we considered to be the appropriate response to the current challenges faced by companies and best practices to ensure their sustainable development during the epidemic ...
The executive team has agreed to ease the pressure on the company's employees so that they can support the company's mission in the long term.
We support your efforts to ease the pressure.
For all employees, contractors and contractors:
Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours per day (or 20 hours per week), and any subsequent changes will be notified.
This adjustment is not a holiday notice. If you work longer hours a day, we'll give you a job according to the length of your work.
However, given the unpredictability of the current world situation, priority will be given to your personal needs, such as caring for family members, shopping or medical consultations.
We're not following your hours.
If you're sick, please leave your job.
It's self-evident, but we'd like to remind you. Please rest assured.
You do not need to take sick leave or paid leave, but you need to inform the manager and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure that critical areas of work are not affected.
(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please inform Bryan of talent and culture, which will support you and ensure that your situation is duly monitored by management.)
We'll pay the full amount for the hourly wage.
We have already expressed our commitment and renewed our commitment to honour the commitments made to the contractors and our hour-work colleagues.
Our pay to all will continue to be calculated on the basis of the remuneration received for normal working hours under normal conditions.
Even if you're sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people choose to communicate with the outside world by working to release their own stress.
Our work can bring incredible returns, especially at this time.
But taking care of yourself is still the first.
We ask you to remain in communication with the manager so that we can get an update on your situation and make adjustments accordingly.
Give priority to the important work.
We have to keep some important work going.
The work of the website reliability engineering team, the human resources operating team, the trust and security team and the fund-raising team (and other teams) is essential and may require additional support.
We will begin to assess current objectives with all sectors and shift our focus to support matters critical to our mission.
We all have a lot to do, but we need to focus on the most important items.
A temporary slowdown will not affect future developments.
We're not going to "overtime" after the outbreak.
We're not asking you to work overtime, because it doesn't seem realistic.
We accept that the current environment has changed and we will set new targets and timetables, as appropriate.
What will happen to the APP (annual plan)?
We plan to adjust the delivery schedule of the 2020-2021 plan to meet the new realities and daily working hours requirements.
We would like to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan in exchange for more time to be spent on budget development to enable staff to prioritize critical tasks and take care of themselves and their families, and to adjust working arrangements for those who need or wish to reduce their workloads in the coming weeks.
The extended schedule can significantly reduce the current planned workload across the organization and reduce the pressure on its work ...
If the proposal is adopted, we will update the follow-up work programme to delegates and teams as soon as possible.
Thank the APP team for their leadership in this process.
Office status, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we learned that a colleague from the San Francisco office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
But, in a sense of caution, we hired antiviral cleaners to completely disinfect the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade disinfection solutions to disinfect the surfaces and the halls and elevators leading to our floors.
The office building is fulfilling its duty of care agreement to use the corresponding product to secure the tenants.
We believe that when you decide to get back to work, the Office is fully prepared to welcome you.
Our office in Washington, D.C. uses the WeWork office, where WeWork shares the COVID-19 agreement with us and all Washington, D.C. staff.
As of last week, Washington, D.C.'s office had been converted to full telecommuting in line with the guidance we shared with San Francisco.
At the same time, as some New York office colleagues already know, we have also been discussing issues related to the rental of office space in the Brooklyn area.
These discussions are continuing, but may be postponed.
Some colleagues were exposed to telecommuting for the first time.
Other long-distance colleagues would like to provide them with some suggestions for adjusting their working methods:
Meeting time should be controlled within one to two hours.
If you need more time, consider spreading the content of the meeting over multiple dates.
Clearly set the objectives of the meeting, set the agenda for the meeting and send reading materials in advance.
Videoconferencing as a default mode of meetings, with online collaboration and contacts using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
In each meeting, a moderator is assigned to chair, one person is assigned to monitor questions in the chat window and track changes in the list of speakers, and another person is assigned responsibility (or multi-stakeholder collaboration) to assist in the proceedings.
If you need comfortable headphones, send an e-mail to technical support.
Use your health allowance to buy snacks.
Add #remoties on Slack to discuss distributional work with colleagues
The Human Resources Operations Team is studying human engineering guidance in the form of webinars to help all Fundation colleagues work more efficiently during their distributed offices.
Last week, we asked all community recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikipedia before WHO declared the epidemic.
These and other restrictions on the cancellation of activities may result in the inability of these community recipients to complete their original contribution activities, which we have informed them that we understand, while at the same time promising that none of them will be punished for postponing or modifying these objectives.
In the coming week, we will continue to provide more guidance at the Wikimania and other district community meetings and thematic community meetings.
The global community seems to be suffering from the devastation of the epidemic, but it also reflects the comfort of being able to stay focused on their communities, Wikimedia and others.
In the future, the CRT team will set up a page on Meta-Wiki that will provide communities with a space to monitor impacts and track community communications with us.
Keep in touch and communicate with COVID-19-related issues
We plan to hold a special staff meeting next week at 1400 hours (Coordinate World Time)/07:00 (Pacific Time), and we will send an invitation to you later in your calendar.
At the meeting, we will share some updates, answer your questions and allow some time for discussion.
We are here to help you.
At the same time, you can learn more about the information mentioned in this e-mail on Office Wiki and other important information relevant to COVID-19.
The CRT team will update these pages in a timely manner and concentrate all the information in one place.
We are trying to maintain regular communication with workers living in countries/areas currently severely affected by the epidemic.
If you have any questions about travel, activities, main workflows or insurance, or if you need other assistance, contact and cooperate with the CRT team at any time.
We are here to provide you with the support and communication you need.
If you have an intimate or sensitive issue, please send an e-mail to Brian Judan, head of global human resources operations.
Although we face these changes, we cannot forgo our work and obligations.
On the contrary, the epidemic has led us to realize that we may now need to adjust our work and obligations in ways that have not been done in the past.
We believe that these measures are necessary to enable us to support each other in the continuation of their work, to provide the support we need for our actions and to continue to bring the services on which they depend to the world.
You can't be afraid of the challenge if you plan at all times.
Now, please support each other and create space for important work over the next few weeks or months.
We need everyone to contribute to this goal, so please take care of yourselves and your family so that we can stay the best in the world when we need it.
Finally, please remember to wash your hands and not touch your faces.
Katherine, Team CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) with other members of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2, ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the pulmonary, artery, heart, kidney and intestinal cytogenesis (cellular membrane).
ACE2 is expected to be a drug target for cardiovascular diseases by reducing the levels of vascular tension II and increasing the levels of Ang (1-7) to contain the activity of the related vascular tension enzyme (Angiotensin-conversion Enzyme, ACE). ACE2 is also the entry point for certain coronary viruses into cells.
The human version of this enzyme is commonly referred to as HACE2.
Angioplasty converter 2 is a zinc-containing metallic enzyme located on the surface of the inner cell and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-end-of-end enzyme M2 structure field and a C-end Collectrin kidney amino acid trans-shipment protein structure field.
ACE2 is a single I-type membrane protein exposed to lung and other tissue cell surfaces.
Another enzyme, known as the sheddase, disassembles the extracellular structure area of ACE2 from across the membrane and releases the soluble protein into the blood and eventually discharges it into the urine.
ACE2 exists in most organs: ACE2 is attached to a cellal membrane, mainly a lung type II pulmonary cell, a intestinal cortex cell, an arteries and vein internal cells of most organs, and an arterial smooth muscle cells.
The ACE2 mRNA expression was found in the cerebral cortex, the texture, the subtrench brain and the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to counterbalance ACE.
ACE decomposition of angioplasty I to an angioplasty activity.
ACE2 Reciprocal fission vascular tension II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyse it into an vascular tension with an vascular expansion activity (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 is also able to crack a number of other species, including disaperate 9 buffers, aperin, neuropressure, morphine A and stomach hunger.
ACE2 can also regulate the transport of SLC6A19 membrane of neutral amino acid trans-protein and is related to Hartnup.
As a membrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for certain coronary viruses into cells, including HCov-NL63; SARS-Cov (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 S1 puncture proteins are combined with the enzyme structure of the cell surface ACE2, leading to ingestion and the transfer of viruses and enzymes to the inner core of the cell.
This entry process also requires host cytonic protein enzyme TPPSS2 triggering the activation of S proteins, and research is currently under way to see whether the inhibition of the process can be used as a potential cure. Some assume that lowering the ACE2 level in cells might help to combat infection.
However, several professional associations and regulators recommend the continued use of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic evaluation and analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors can significantly reduce the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group".
And, "The use of ACE inhibitors to treat patients with higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with intermediate and heart failure, reduces the risk of pneumonia."
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, but results are less reliable than the overall risk of pneumonia ... "
Reassembled ACE2 (rhaACE2) is considered a new method of treating acute lung damage, which seems to improve the pulmonary flow force indicators and saturation of blood oxygen in the acute respiratory stress syndrome pigs due to glutose.
rhaACE2 has a half-life of about 10 hours in the body, 30 minutes in effect, 24 hours in operation (continuing time).
Some studies have shown that rhaACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerant inhibitors or for diseases with high levels of circulatory vascular stress II. rhaACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome by the rhin-angiotensin system, RAS.
b'COVID-19 application is a mobile software designed to respond to the 2019-20 coronary virus epidemic, help track people in close contact and identify individuals who may have been exposed to the infection.
A number of applications have been developed or proposed by some regions and jurisdictions with the support of official governments.
A number of frameworks have been developed to build a close contact tracking application.
Privacy issues are also a source of concern, especially in the case of systems that need to track the geographical location of users of applications.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of bluetooth signals to record distance between users and other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate this function in support of Bluetooth applications directly into Andre and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government has jointly developed an application to support citizens to check for contact with the COVID-19 patient.
The program is currently in use in more than 200 cities in China. Singapore has launched an application called TraceTogether.
This application was developed by the local IT community and released as open source software and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia introduced a Bluetooth based application, "Stop Korona!", to track the exposure of potential infected persons and help medical institutions respond quickly.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication Technology and the Ministry of Health in Northern Macedonia.
As of April 14, 2020, the application is awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the Government announced that the close contact tracking application is in advanced stages of development and will be operational in the coming weeks. Ireland and France are planning to launch a similar application ( "StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering the development of similar applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to launch a geo-fence application for patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow to ensure that patients do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge University, cited a number of practical problems that could exist in the application system, including false positive misstatements and the possible lack of effectiveness if only a small group of people used the application.
To prevent misleading or harmful dissemination of coronary virus applications, apples limit the type of organization in which coronary virus-related applications can be published in apple application shops, i.e. only for "official" or other well-received organizations.
Google and Amazon have imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders have expressed concern about the use of coronary virus applications for large-scale surveillance, in particular whether the surveillance infrastructure developed to respond to coronary viruses should be dismantled after the threat has been eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such surveillance.
These organizations announced eight conditions to be met by government projects:
Surveillance must be "legitimate, necessary and proportionate";
Monitoring and surveillance expansion must include sunset provisions;
Data collected for COVID-19 purposes only;
Data security and anonymous information must be protected and there is evidence of effective protection;
Digital surveillance must avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
Any data sharing with third parties should be defined by law;
Safeguards must be provided to prevent data abuse and to provide citizens with the right to respond to data abuse;
All "relevant stakeholders" are required to participate effectively, including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) have also issued a checklist.
Google/Apple ' s proposed plan is designed to address ongoing surveillance problems and remove them from the equipment operating system as soon as tracking is no longer required.
Some countries have introduced web-based rather than application-based location tracking, without the need for users to download applications, while avoiding being tracked.
In Israel, web-based tracking has been approved.
A web-based solution with access to the original location data may have serious privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers are required to access personal location data; many privacy protection systems that only use central servers to communicate with each other have been created (see below for more details).
Korea has introduced a system that is not application-based to carry out contact tracking missions.
Instead of using specialized applications, the system chooses to collect tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and then combines that information to send notifications to potential infected persons via text messages.
In addition to using this information to alert potential close contacts, the Government has been allowed to make available location information because of the significant changes in information privacy laws following the outbreak of the MERS epidemic.
The public has access to this information through a wide range of applications and websites, and some countries (including Germany) are considering using both centralized and privacy protection systems.
As of April 6, 2020, no specific details have been published.
As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy protection solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Use (BLE) to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
PEP-PT is a coordinated programme with a centralized and decentralized approach, not a single agreement. Dispersed agreements include decentralized privacy protection proximity tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, originally referred to as contact event number, CEN), privacy sensitive protocols and mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT).
According to these agreements, identifiable personal data will never leave the device, and all matches will be made on the device.
The MIT Media Laboratory privacy team has been developing the SafePaths platform, which uses privacy protection techniques when collecting and using position or path cross-data to track COVID-19.
The platform is based on the development of a white paper entitled "Application debauchery: preserving personal privacy in the epidemic", released in March 2020. In addition, a company originally created and dedicated to the development of privacy technologies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Laboratory, Enigma MPC, is also developing a similar platform called SafeTrace.
SafeTrace uses security hardware technology to support users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, a number of groups jointly formed the Global TCN Alliance around essentially the same methodology and the basic overlap agreement, with the goal of reducing fragmentation information and supporting global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, which is a key to achieving wider application.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore Government announced that its official government applications were using the Open Source Trade Agreement.
On April 10th, 2020, Google and Apple, which controlled Andre and iOS mobile platforms, respectively, announced a close contact tracking program, claiming that it combined the Bluetooth Low Power Use technique with privacy protection encryption technology to protect privacy.
In addition, they published the core technical specifications used in the system.
Apple and Google stated that the system was planned to be rolled out in three phases:
Launch of tools to support governments in creating official coronary virus tracking applications that protect privacy
To integrate this function directly into the iOS and Andre systems, Google and Apple first launch the system through an operation system update and then remove the system in the same way as the threat of the epidemic, thereby addressing the follow-up monitoring problem.
b Drug repositioning (also known as drug reuse, re-evaluation, redistribution or treatment conversion) refers to the diversion of an approved drug to other uses for the treatment of a disease or medical condition that is different from its original research and development purpose.
This is a scientific route for developing safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a covid-19 vaccine and blood transfusion during the recovery period. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins for pharmaceutical use, with multiple formulation combinations for each protein.
An analysis of these combinations provides a rational solution for developing effective antiviral drugs for COVID-19 proteins.
The most important of the SARS-COV-2 target proteins include papaya-based protein enzymes, RNA dependence RNA polymerases, helix enzymes, S proteins and ADP nucleic diphosphate enzymes.
Hussein A. et al. studied several candidate compounds and then optimized and analysed the skeleton similarities of these candidate compounds against the highest level of comparable drugs approved in order to accelerate the development of effective anti-SARS-COV-2 drugs in their pre-clinical trials and to recommend them in clinical research designs.

According to the South China Morning Report, Shinzo Abe has made a proposal to the Trump government to purchase the drug.
It may not be safe for pregnant or pre-pregnant women to use the drug.
A study of Lapinave/Letra (a combination of antiviral drugs Lopinave and Litonawe) concluded that "no benefit was observed".
These drugs are designed to suppress the reproduction of the human immunodeficiency virus by combining it with protein enzymes.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find compounds that can be combined with SARS-COV-2 protein enzymes. The scientific community has criticized the diversion of resources for drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization has included Lopinawa/Litonave in the international solidarity experiment.
Red Silvey was a drug created and developed by Gillid Science to treat Ebola and Marburg infections. Gillid Science later discovered that Red Silvey had antiviral activity in vitro on a wide range of filial viruses, pneumonia viruses, secondary viscoviruses and coronary viruses.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is that drug resistance through mutation can lead to more serious diseases and transmissions.
A number of early pre-test studies have shown that Redeswie may have high drug resistance genetic barriers. Several clinical trials are currently under way, two of which are being conducted at the University Hospital in Cleveland; one for moderate symptoms and the other for more severe symptoms.
Three vitamin C intravenous clinical trials are currently under way for patients with serious hospital conditions COVID-19; two placebo tests (China, Canada) and one non-record test (Italy).
New York City started testing antibiotics for achictocin on March 24th, 2020.

Virus carriers (I-developing and candidate vaccines: CanSino Biologics, 5-type gland viral carriers)
In April, CEPI scientists reported that a total of 115 candidate vaccines were in the early stages of development, 78 of which were identified as ongoing projects (79 according to the Milken Institute) and 37 announced but with little public information (presumed to be being planned or designed).
Initial safety and immunogenity tests are conducted during the I-II period, usually at random, multiple-point tests with a placebo comparison, with a more precise and effective dose determined.
Phase III tests typically involve a larger number of participants, including control groups, and test the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring adverse effects at the best dose.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates actively developed (acknowledged as of the beginning of April 2020), 74 have yet to undergo human evaluation (remaining "preclinical" research).

Various social media articles have encouraged conspiracy theories, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 has been found and that vaccines are available.
The patents cited in various social media articles refer to the patents of other existing coronary viruses (e.g. SARS coronary virus) in terms of the gene sequences and vaccines.
2019 Corvette disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Common symptoms include heat, cough and gas.
Other symptoms may include powerlessness, muscle acidity, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The lurking period from exposure to onset is 2-14 days, usually about 5 days.
Although the majority of cases show mild symptoms, some can develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, the total number of reported cases in 210 countries and territories worldwide was over 224 million and the number of deaths exceeded 153,000.
More than 568,000 people are being treated and rehabilitated. The virus spreads mainly between people through close contact, often by coughing, sneezing or speaking.
Although exhales can cause spout, it usually falls on the ground or on the surface of a variety of objects and does not cause long-range transmission.
Also, if someone touches the surface contaminated by the virus and then touches their nose and noses, it can get infected.
The virus survives on the surface of the object for up to 72 hours.
The standard diagnosis is a real-time reversion of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) by nose-sawing.
It is recommended that those suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers wear masks.
The recommendations for the public to wear masks vary from place to place, with some authorities opposing the wearing of masks to others demanding the wearing of masks.
There are currently no COVID-19 vaccine or special effects antiviral treatment programmes.
Most countries in all six WHO regions have reported local transmission of the disease.
People infected with the virus may be unsymptomatic and may also have symptoms of suspected influenza, such as heat, cough, powerlessness and heat.
Emergency symptoms include respiratory difficulties, persistent chest pains or chest palsy, vagueness, difficulty in sensibilizing and bruised face or lips; if they occur, immediate medical attention is recommended.
A few cases may be accompanied by upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, snotty or throat pain.
Different rates of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, were also monitored.
Some of the cases in China began with symptoms of chest palsy and heart palsy.
Some cases may develop into viral pneumonia, multiple organ failure and even death.
We call this the lurking period.
COVID-19 usually has 5-6 days but may extend to 2-14 days.
97.5% of infected persons show symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of people with no symptoms of infection in the spread of the epidemic is not yet fully clear; however, preliminary evidence suggests that people with no symptoms of infection may contribute to the spread of the disease ...
The percentage of people with no symptoms of infection has not yet been determined and research is being intensified.The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20 per cent of confirmed cases do not show any symptoms during hospitalization.
The National Health Council of China has included the cases of non-synchronous diseases in its daily circulars since April 1; 130 (78%) of the 166 infections that occurred on that day were detected.
Both saliva and saliva can carry a lot of viruses.
Speak louder and spit more than normal talk.
A study in Singapore found that an open cough could cause the most farthest spread of foam 4.5 m (15 feet).
Although these viruses are generally not transmitted by air, the National Academy of Sciences has determined that they may be transmitted through bio-alcosols and that the air collectors in the corridor outside the ward have detected positive samples of the virus RNA.
Medical procedures such as tube intubation and cardiopulmonary recovery (CPR) can cause the aerosolization of respiratory tracts, which can lead to air transmission.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through excreta, but this risk is considered to be low.... When a patient has symptoms, the virus is most contagious; although it may be transmitted before symptoms occur, the risk is lower.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Control (ECDC) has indicated that although the spread of the new coronary virus is not yet fully clear, it is generally transmitted by one person to two or three people. The duration of the virus's survival on the surface of the object varies from hours to days.
Specifically, the new coronary virus is known to survive one day on a cardboard, up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% pure copper products.
However, the time of survival is also influenced by humidity and temperature.
If properly used, soap and detergents can also be used to kill the virus. The fat layer of the virus that degrades the soap product can render it inactive while removing the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzachlor ammonium and chlorinated glucose acid (a surgical disinfectant). A study in Hong Kong, China, showed that samples of saliva were collected on average two days after admission.
The first sample of 5/6 patients had the highest viral loads, and the second day the first 6 patients detected the highest viral loads.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new serious acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2), first separated from three pneumonia patients in a group of Wuhan acute respiratory diseases.
All features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the natural coronary virus.
Before the virus enters the body, it can be killed with domestic soap, because soap can destroy the virus's protective capsule. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lung is the organ most affected by COVID-19 because it enters the host cell through angioplasty 2 (ACE2) which has the highest concentration in the lung 's type II lung cell.
The virus combines with ACE2 and enters the host cells through a special surface-based protein called "pump."
Of the patients admitted to Wuhan Hospital in China, 12 per cent found acute heart damage and a higher proportion of patients with serious illnesses.
The overall inflammation and immune system disorders caused by the deterioration of the pathologies and the high incidence of cardiovascular symptoms, but the acute heart damage may also be related to the ACE2 receptor of the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed in the heart and are involved in regulating heart function.
The high incidence (31 per cent) and the high 25 per cent (25 per cent) of the blood clots of the ICU-supervised COVID-19 infected persons may be related to pre- and post-negative disorders. The CIVD-19 fatal autopsy found a confluenced lung damage (DAD) and lymphocyte immersion in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tendency to express ACE2's respiratory topskin cells, CIVD-19 patients suffer from hyperinflammation.
In particular, the pathogenic GM-CSF of the COVID-19 patients is associated with the inflammation of the IL-6 and severe lung pathology.
The autopsy report also saw lymphocytes immersion.
WHO has published several disease detection programmes.
The standard test method is a real-time reversal of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually conducted for respiratory samples obtained through snout swabs; however, snout swams or saliva samples can also be used.
Normally, within hours and two days.
Blood tests can also be performed, but two blood samples are required to be collected for two weeks, with little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to separate coronary strains and publish gene sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test agents to detect infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (which not only detects active infections but also detects whether individuals have been infected in the past) is still under development but has not yet been promoted.
According to Chinese experience, the accuracy of the tests is only 60% to 70%.
On March 21, 2020, the United States FDA approved the first immediate diagnostic reagent, which became operational at the end of the month.
Early infections are often seen in bipulmonary filamental glass, with extra-week asymmetrical and subsequent cloths.
As the virus develops, there may be sub-pleasure of the pleura, gravel path signs (breath spacing with varying degrees of pulmonary blisters) and actual lung changes.
There is very little information on the micropathological damage and pathology of COVID-19.
The main pathologies of the autopsy were as follows:
Eye check: Pulse, heart attack, pulmonary fission and edema
Four severe levels of viral pneumonia were observed:
Light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pulmonary cell growth, large numbers of atypical lung cells, lymphocytes immersed with intertonic inflammation and the formation of multinuclear megacells
Heavy pneumoconiosis: DAD with pulmonary pulmonary osmosis fluid.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
Pneumonia recovery: osmosis of lung cavity and interpulmonary fibrosis
Blood: Intravenous vascular condensation (DIC); larvae-young red cell reaction
Preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the likelihood of infection include: staying at home; avoiding access to crowd-intensive areas; frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintaining good respiratory hygiene; and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) proposes to cover its nose and nose with paper towels while coughing or sneezing; in the absence of paper towels, to use the inner side of the elbow.
It's recommended to clean your hands after coughing or sneezing.
CDC recommends wearing a mask in public to prevent, to some extent, the transmission of the virus by the unsynchronous patient. The core of the strategy of maintaining social distance lies in closing schools and workplaces, limiting movement and eliminating large public gatherings, thereby reducing access to large groups of infected persons.
In addition, the social distance guidelines require a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 metres) in interpersonal communication.
There is no effective drug to prevent COVID-19. Given that it is expected that vaccines will not be developed until at least 2021, efforts to reduce the peak of the epidemic are key to controlling COVID-19 transmission, which is what we know about the razing epidemiology curve.
At the same time, the CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially in the back of a toilet or when there's a visible stain on their hands, before dinner and after snotting, coughing or sneezing.
Also, it is proposed to use alcohol-containing handwashing fluids of at least 60% alcohol, but only when there is no soap or running water around them. For areas where it is not possible to purchase water-free hand-washing fluids, WHO provides two formulations for production on the ground.
These formulations stimulate antibacterial activity through ethanol or isopropanol.
Use of hydrogen peroxide to help eliminate bacterium spores from alcohol; peroxide is not a "hand disinfectant".
Add glycerine as a humidant.
Supportive care for people, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support and other affected vital organ support.
CDC suggests that a suspected viral carrier wear an improvised mask.
EMO has been introduced to mitigate respiratory failure, but its benefits are still to be studied.
It is recommended to maintain hygiene and promote healthy lifestyles and eating habits, thereby increasing immunity ...
Supportive therapy may be effective for early infected lightly ill patients. WHO and the National Health Council of China launched an initiative calling for proper care for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.
U.S. critical pathology and lung experts have compiled treatment proposals from agencies and made them available free of charge through IBCC.
As of April 2020, no COVID-19 special effects therapy had been developed.
For some of the symptoms, some medical experts suggested the use of pyromatic pain (Acetaminophenol) instead of Bloven for first-line treatment.
Preventive measures must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, and special care must be taken to protect against possible aerosol operations, such as tubes or hand-held air, in a medical environment.
With regard to medical personnel caring for patients with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that, in addition to standard preventive measures, exposure prevention measures and air transmission prevention measures, patients should also be transferred to airborne infectious disease isolation cells (AIIR). CDC provides an overview of the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the epidemic.
Recommended equipment: PPE protective clothing, respirator or mask, eye protection and medical gloves. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
N95 The mask is authorized to be used in industrial settings, but FDA has authorized the use of the mask in accordance with the emergency use authorization (EUA).
It is mainly used to prevent inhalation of suspended particles (e.g. dust), but is used for other uses without ensuring effective isolation of specific biological agents.
If there is no mask, the CDC recommends a mask and, if necessary, a homemade mask.
Most COVID-19 cases show mild symptoms and do not require mechanical air conditioning or other options, but a certain percentage of cases require such measures.
Medical staff are actively conducting research to provide breathing support to patients suffering from respiratory failure. There is evidence that high-resistence oxidation or dual-phase airways are able to avoid intubation.
It is not clear whether these two treatments will have the same effect on patients with severe illnesses.
If conditions permit, some doctors tend to use creative mechanical air, as this technology limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow oxygen treatments. Serious cases are dominated by older persons (60 years and older, especially those over 80 years of age).
The number of beds per capita in many developed countries is inadequate, and the health system is unable to cope with the critical situation requiring hospital admission due to the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases, given the limitations of medical conditions.
A study in China found that 5% of patients had to go to intensive care, 2.3% needed mechanical air, and 1.4% would die as a result.
In China, about 30% of the COVID-19 patients were eventually admitted to ICU.
With the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, the degree of mechanical air conditioning has increased and oxygen compatibility has become increasingly difficult.
At that time, pressure control models and high PEP respirators will be required in order to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung damage and gas chest damage from the respirator.
Old respirators may not be high.
Potential therapy has been under study since January 2020, and a number of antiviral drugs are now in clinical trials.
Redseed seems to be one of the most promising drugs in the world.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several drugs that have been tested have either been approved for other uses or are in advanced stages of testing.
People who are seriously ill can try to use antiviral drugs.
WHO called on a wide range of volunteers to participate in potential therapy effectiveness and safety trials. FDA has been granted temporary authorization for blood transfusions during recovery as experimental treatment for life-threatening patients.
The necessary clinical studies have not yet been conducted to prove that the treatment is safe and effective in treating the disease.
In February 2020, China released a mobile application to contain the outbreak.
Users are required to enter names and ID numbers.
This application allows for the detection of "close contact" by monitoring data to determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
Once potential risks are detected, the application not only recommends self-segregation, but also alerts local health officials.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized security agencies to track cell phone data of persons suspected to be carriers of the coronary virus.
The aim of this measure is to force isolation and to protect groups that may have access to infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, German telecommunications shared aggregated mobile phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute of the German Federal Government in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia deploys facial recognition technology to detect violators of quarantine.
According to Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera, mobile phone operators show that "40% of citizens are still walking around."
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hacker marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronary virus on a global scale.
Isolation, travel restrictions, treatment of side effects or fear of infection, all of which may be troubling.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor, "Social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic depression are perfect storms that harm people ' s mental health and well-being."
The disease is milder, with little or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as common colds.
Cases of mild illness can normally recover within two weeks, while cases of severe illness or acute illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
According to data from other similar viruses (e.g. SARS and MERS) pregnant women are at higher risk of developing to CVID-19 patients but lack COVID-19 data support. COVID-19 may have an impact on the lungs of some people, thereby causing pneumonia.
In the most affected areas, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, schizophrenic shock or multiple organ failure.
COVID-19 related complications include sepsis, condensation abnormalities, and heart, kidney and liver damage.
6% of the COVID-19 admitted patients suffered from condensation abnormalities, especially the prolonged condensation enzymes, while 4% of the group suffered kidney abnormalities.
About 20 to 30% of the COVID-19 patients have hepatic enzymes (paralyze) rising.
According to the same report, the average time between morbidity and death is 10 days, with an average of five days of hospitalization.
However, the average time of admission to ICU to death is seven days.
Early case studies have found that the average time between the onset of early symptoms and death is 14 days, with an overall time range of 6 to 41 days.
A study conducted by the National Health Council of China (NHC) found that the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for males and 1.7 per 1,000 for females.
A pathological examination of an autopsy lung sample showed that both lungs had a pervading pulmonary damage accompanied by cellular fission fluid samples.
The pulmonary cells observed virulent cell pathologies.
The lung image is similar to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8 per cent of the deaths reported by China ' s National Board of Health and Hygiene, heart damage due to elevated calcium protein levels or a heart arrest.
According to data released in March in the United States, 89 per cent of admitted patients have a history of past illness, and the availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region may also affect mortality.
Due to regional differences and methodological difficulties, estimates of disease mortality vary.
The underestimation of cases of mild illness could lead to overestimation of mortality.
However, if the death of a case is due to previous infections, it may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop into covid-19 patients and 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or death. People are concerned about the long-term consequences of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority in China found that the lung activity of some of the recovering people had decreased by 20% to 30% and that the lung scan showed damage to the organs.
In addition, recovery may be subject to intensive care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it is not yet certain that the previous infection will provide effective long-lasting immunization to those recovering from it.
The behaviour characteristics of other coronary viruses have been identified as potentially immune, but there have been reports of coronary virus tests being performed shortly after the recovery of some of the COVID-19 cases.
It's thought that these cases are deteriorating rather than reinfecting.
The virus is considered to be a natural virus, originating in animals, by spilling the infection.
The actual origin has yet to be determined, but as of December 2019, the infection was almost entirely interpersonal.
The first 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases published by the Lancet in January 2020 showed that the earliest date of occurrence was 1 December 2019.
WHO's official publication reported the earliest date of occurrence on December 8th, 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary from region to region, and will change over time and be influenced by demographic characteristics such as the quantity tested, the quality of the health system, treatment programmes, the first outbreak and age, gender and overall health status.
By the end of 2019, WHO assigned the ICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 to laboratory confirmed SARS-COV-2 infections, U07.2 to clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of infectious COVID-19 deaths not diagnosed by laboratory. Death rate equals the total number of confirmed deaths within the given time frame.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate was 6.9 per cent as of April 17, 2020 (153,822/2, 240, 191).
Mortality rates vary from region to region. Other measures include case mortality (CFR), which reflects the percentage of confirmed deaths, and infection mortality (IFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed deaths, and disease deaths, which accounts for the percentage of infected persons (including those diagnosed and undiagnosed).
These statistics are not time-bound and are tracked from infection to case resolution for a particular population group.
Although not all infected persons have an antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of infections.
Castiglione d'Adda, a small town with a population of only 4600, has now 80 (1.7 per cent) died of the epidemic.
In Gangelt, the epidemic spread through various carnival days, even reaching young people, but mortality is relatively low, not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified.
Besides, the German medical system is overstretched.
According to the blood donors' assessment, about 3% of Dutch citizens may have antibodies.
To date, 69 people (0.004% of the total population) have been identified as having died of COVID-19.
The effects of the epidemic and mortality rates vary by sex.
Studies in China and Italy show that male mortality is higher than female mortality.
50-60-year-old men are most at risk of death, with only 90-year-olds with similar gender disparities.
The mortality rate is 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per 1,000 for women.
The exact causes of this gender difference are not yet clear, but may be due to genetic and behavioural factors ...
Gender-based differences in immunology, lower rates of smoking among women and lower ages of co-morbidity among men (e.g. hypertension) than among women, resulting in higher mortality rates among men than among women.
In Europe, 57 per cent of men are infected and 72 per cent of the total number of deaths due to COVID-19.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government has yet to track sex-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola virus, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The proportion of female health workers (especially nurses) is higher, and the risk of exposure to the virus is higher.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease as "COVID-19".
The head of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreesus, explained: CO stands for the crown, VI for the virus, D for the disease, 19 for the first outbreak.
The name was chosen in order to avoid citing specific geographical locations (e.g. China), animal species or populations, consistent with international naming proposals to prevent stigmatization. The virus that triggered COVID-19 is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
In addition, WHO uses the "COVID-19 virus" and the "COVID-19 virus" in mass communication.
Diseases and viruses are commonly known as coronary viruses.
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were widely referred to as "circle virus" and "circle virus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases as temporary viruses and disease names, in accordance with the 2015 guidelines for the use of places in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
In view of capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers have started printing health materials such as snaws and respirators.
For example, an Italian hospital urgently needs ventilation valves, suppliers cannot deliver components within the required time, a local start-up company works backwards and prints 100 ventilation valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, conspiracy theories about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease, false information and false information spread rapidly through the network.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
There's no evidence of copying the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of this disease.
Government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers are actively engaged in international research to develop vaccines and drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "Solidarity Experiment" to assess the efficacy of the treatment of the four existing antiviral compounds, which are currently the most potentially treatable.
There is no vaccine, but institutions at all levels are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Since both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells via the ACE2 receptor, the previous work of SARS-CoV needs to be used.
People are studying three vaccine strategies.
First of all, researchers plan to develop a virus-wide vaccine.
The use of these viruses, whether non-active or deadly, is designed to provoke rapid human immune responses when new infections COVID-19 occur.
The second strategy is to develop sub-unit vaccines aimed at developing a vaccine that motivates the immune system to respond sensitively to certain sub-units of the virus.
In the SARS-CoV-2 case, such studies focused on the S punctuation protein of the assisted virus into the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is to develop a vaccine for nucleic acid (DNA vaccine or RNA vaccine, a new vaccine development technology).
The safety and effectiveness of the pilot vaccines developed under the above strategies must be tested. On March 16, 2020, four Seattle volunteers launched the first vaccine clinical trial.
The vaccine contains a clean gene sequence that is replicated from disease-induced viruses. The consistent belief that antibody dependence enhancement may be a major challenge in developing SARS-COV-2 vaccines is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials had been conducted.
Seven tests were evaluated and approved for malaria treatment, including four studies on hydroxyl chloride or chlorazine.
The conversion of antiviral drugs to China accounts for the majority of research in China, and nine three-stage clinical trials on Red Seville will be conducted in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of the COVID-19 vaccine and candidate drugs has been initiated. The existing antiviral drugs for several treatments of COVID-19 are currently being assessed, including Radesive, chlorazine and hydroxylene, Lopinave/Litonave and Lopinave/Litonave combinations of jammers beta.
As of March 2020, Redesville's treatment has been preliminarily proven.
It was observed that the clinical symptoms of patients treated with the compassionate drug Redseed had been reduced.
At this stage in the United States, China and Italy are conducting III clinical trials. In February 2020, China launched a chlorazine study (used in the past to treat malaria) with preliminary results.
However, there were calls for a peer review of the study.
The health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chlorazine.
But the Wuhan Veterinary Institute recommends 1 gram a day, while reminding that double doses are very dangerous and may even be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, FDA issued authorizations for emergency use of chlorazine and hydroxyl chloride, but doctors have the right to decide whether to treat patients with COVID-19 with both of these drugs.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of Libaverin are in vitro inhibitive to SARS-CoV-2.
After confirming the low concentration inhibition of SARS-COV-2, it is recommended to use nitroconite to carry out further body studies. Studies have shown that the raw puncture protein caused by the transmolete protein enzyme sulfonic acid 2 (TMPRSS2) is a necessary condition for SARS-COV-2 interaction with the ACE2 receptor to enter the human body.
There are serious limitations in the studies of chloroquine and hydroxyl chloride, whether or not they are used in conjunction with Achillin, and the medical community will not be able to accept these treatments unless further research has been carried out. Ostawi has no in vitro inhibition on SARS-COV-2 and has not yet found any therapeutic effect on COVID-19.
Cell factor storms could be complications in the treatment of serious patients in CIVID-19.
After completing a small study, the National Health Council of China included the TOC in its treatment guidelines.
Following the positive results of the critical patient test, Italy is conducting a non-random test at the national level for two periods.
In combination with sero-protein blood testing, the identification of cell factors is designed to contain the development of the disease, which is thought to cause the death of some of the infected persons.
In 2017, with the support of retrospective case studies, FDA approved the use of white cytogen 6 for other causes of steroid disorders, known as CAR T cell therapy.
So far, there is no random cross-reference evidence to prove that the Torpedo resistance is effective.
The pure enrichment antibodies from the COVID-19 immune system are currently being studied and injected to people in need of antibodies as passive immune therapy until vaccine development is successful.
SARS tried this strategy during the outbreak, but the cure is still open.
The virus is a mechanism for the expected effects of the passive anti-retroviral therapy guide SARS-COV-2 immunization defence.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibodies dependent cell toxicity and/or digestive effects, can achieve the same effect.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of man-made monoclon antibodies, are currently being developed.
The amount of serum produced during the recovery period may increase to facilitate rapid deployment. ... The serum consists of the liquid part of the blood of the recovering patient, which contains specific antibodies against the virus.
The coronary virus disease, a closely related syndrome.
Dr. Lee Wen-hyang at Wuhan Central Hospital raised his awareness of the spread of the new coronary virus, which unfortunately got infected with COVID-19 and died.
