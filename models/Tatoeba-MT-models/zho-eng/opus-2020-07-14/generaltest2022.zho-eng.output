Is there any way to punish him?
In case it ever happens again.
Or how long before the restaurant is ready? Can you ask me?
The students sing the lead at the big academic year.
Wash your hands with air, judge your disease with breath, and search for the sources of the fog accurately. Last night, at the opening of the 2016 Annual Academic Conference at Zhejiang University, a series of brain-brained academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these results were students, who covered the environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities, etc., and students began with a curious idea and created a number of high-end inventions of applied value, some of which had been awarded international awards at the national level.
Biosensors: Your home doctor.
The Ph.D. Dr. Zhang Diming team at the College of Biomedical Engineering showed a biosensor on the end of a smartphone, half the size of a smartphone.
"All you have to do is breathe a little bit, and this device will be able to test your health first from the gas composition that you have ejected... "
Zhang Diming explained that the sensor was connected to the smartphone and that when the gas came out, the health report showed up on the phone.
Smart handrings that can detect health conditions in the market, usually measured by physical parameters such as temperature, pulse, etc.
And this biosensor uses this new material, graphiteene, which is targeted by chemical elements with a sharp "sniffion" that allows it to be deeper and to accurately reflect the state of health.
Smart Surgery Lantern: Doctor's high-powered eyes
In addition to the smartphones, there are smart surgery lights in the operating room.
The invention won a silver prize this year at the 44th International Innovation Fair in Geneva, Switzerland.
The Master of Science and Engineering at the School of Optical Science and Engineering, Jooling, started a new line of thought in the defects of traditional operating lights and invented intelligent LED surgery without a shadow.
"There are many early detections of diseases, which cannot be removed, and which are related to the lights used by the doctor ' s operating room... "
Shin Joon-fik says, for example, if doctors fail to see all the tumor tissues in time for early cancer examinations, then the cancer cells spread.
This smart operating lamp has four lamps, which, by adjusting the spectrum, enhances the difference between tissues in light.
During the operation, the doctor can readily adjust the light size, lightness, spectrometry, homogeneity of colour and no trace rate, depending on the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This smart operating lamp has been tested at Zhejiang University Medical College, Zhejiang University Medical College, Children ' s Hospital, etc., and has received better feedback.
Last October, the invention won the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: saving water and coolness
The average man washes his hands with water, at best rubs some soap, squeezes some handwashing fluid, while fellow students like Li have invented an air washer.
As long as we stand on the installed washstand, we can compress the air.
"It's like an air pump.
The compressed air creates fluids at the tap, combined with water.
So we can wash our hands! "
Obsolete reaction and bacterial residue experiments have shown that hand-washing by this method is the same as normal hand-washing methods.
This device will only need to be driven by our own gravity, which will ensure cleanliness and save 90 per cent of the water. The process will be completely energyless and energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Summit of Major Challenges, the invention was the only gold prize awarded to many of the world ' s leading schools.
Please arrange to be restored to me as soon as possible, thx.
Please cancel the order and return the cash. Don't count it. Don't use it again.
Bones and chili pickles aren't for kids.
If so, please hurry to order.
Not yet. Thank you.
He asked me to tell you where he is
I'm not waiting. Cancel the order.
I bought it, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can you change it?
Or cancel an order.
Yes, please.
I think it's a very meaningful certificate.
This is one of the skills I think is important in addition to my driver's license!
Let's get it over with: First aid is actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before an ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there's actually some time after the accident when the ambulance arrives, and that's what's at stake.
It's time for first aid.
If I do have a heart attack, a brain bleed, and a breath stop, then we have four minutes of our window of life, four minutes of gold!
So the people around you know how important it is!
It's a terrible feeling to be helpless when we're surrounded by people who fall, and we can save him with professional knowledge, rather than standing there and doing nothing.
"In China, our official data show that three million people die by accident every year, the most dangerous being a heart attack.
In the U.S., it's 15% on average.
At the Casino Hotel in Las Vegas, 780 per cent could be rescued, Shanghai, Beijing less than 1 per cent. "
That's what the first responder, Lok Lok, said.
If a man has a heart attack, no breath, no heartbeat, there's nothing you can do.
We have to breathe artificially, and the pressure on the chest will make it possible to get us out of here.
I found that we still don't have that awareness to learn first aid, but it's too late when it happens, so I called on everyone to learn that skills so that we can react in time when we're in a state of emergency.
Maybe it'll save a man's life!
First aid cards can be signed up at your local Red Cross training centre. I'm registered at the Red Cross training centre in Pearl Sea.
PS: The last graph is a record of what you're about to achieve before you're 25 years old. The first aid card was added to the target list a few months ago, but it was done!
Then I'm going to take another test, and I'm going to go get a dive certificate, and I saw a dive first aid certificate in Red Book, and I think it's going to have to have a first aid certificate, so it's still useful!

No, I haven't.
What's wrong with #NAME?

Because I saw it when I entered the code.
To conclude, I personally think "Four Seas" is a piece of crap in all its aspects, in all its ways.
But you're gonna say it's not as bright as it gets, it's not as good as the choreographer.
There's a lot of crap, so you can sleep in a movie theater, and you can read after you're angry, and the Four Seas is like a monkey on the frown, and it can light your anger in countless ways.
In insulting the audience, HAN Xian was truly a gift.
The most painful thing about this film is that it's like a piece of kryptonite fiction. It's notorious. It's like a little pony's coat.
Even after reading, you'll wonder if there's an implicit metaphor for the director, but when you think about it, it's actually a piece of shit.
Let's just say a few things I can't understand.
The man's home is supposed to be a small island in the south, with his grandmother.
Her grandmother wanted to see the snow, and then the scene arranged for a master in the neighborhood to take her to the northeast in a minivan.
The old man was in the van from south to northeast looking at snow?
He and his father are very relieved about this.
And then this old man's gone.
How did she get a license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why would a biker punk on the island be able to block a mountain road so easily?
Then the truck with the wires in the middle of the road was parked by the side of the road and couldn't even find the truck driver.
It's too obvious.
Why does a knuckle-driver party that doesn't get credit and is suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliaries?
Why didn't you call the police in front of the loan shark?
An adult who knows how to use a smart phone but doesn't know how to open a room card in a hotel and then makes arrangements to not find a hotel owner and sit outside the room for a night?
This inexplicable plot is rife throughout the film, and I feel pain when I remember it because it's so out of context.
Besides the circumstances, what's worse is the subject matter of the film, or the fact that the film has no subject, it's an abominable suture.
At the beginning of the film, you think he wants to make a comedy, and in over 20 minutes you guess it might be an inspirational movie, and half of the time you think it might be a play to show how young people in a small town can't survive, and then you don't even know what you're looking at, and then you have deep doubts about yourself and why you're going to the cinema to watch shit.
For most people, it's actually very familiar with all kinds of movies, like if you want to shoot a biker, then you'll be inspired to comedy and tell the audience how a gifted rookie moves forward to success.
If you want to make love movies, you'll be honest with the young people and waitress girls in town who like to ride motorcycles.
If you want to reflect reality, at least you can't have anything that's against the normal world.
The new motorcycle Yoon-jung had just been burned and could sing, so he couldn't open up some brain holes that Kennedy couldn't even see.
I don't know if it's the acting or the director's request that the owner act like a five-year-old in some way.
And I don't understand why HAN Xian, as a racer, is so keen to add car crashes to his own movie.
Is this film scheduled for the Spring Festival in order to block the audience?

Inspection of the construction and processing equipment for the concrete module of the well, and introduction to the wall brick module of Jungzhou:
Jungzhou is the domestic concrete inspection of the brick machine equipment for the block-up and wall-wall module mechanics, from semi-automatic to fully automated production lines.
Through many years of practice and development, the quality is too high, mainly in the production of hydraulic, mobile, fully automated inspection well series and accessories.
Inspection of the construction and processing equipment for the concrete module of the well.
(a) The characteristics and advantages of the construction equipment for the construction and processing of the well concrete module;
Ixin inspects new construction materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity and gas.
For example: drainage, various types of inspection wells in water storage facilities, rainwater vents, grooves, septic tanks and small structures, bridge-wing walls, etc.
The advantage of using the concrete module to construct inspection wells is that the structure of the module is a cavity around and around the top and bottom of the module, and the combination is a chain of formation.
The walls of the well wall are much more resistant than the construction of flat friction structures.
The module consists of a medium-air structure with vertical perforated perforation, horizontal perforation, puncture injection and the formation of a refilled concrete mesh, which acts as secondary recharge and waterproofing.
The module has a groove over its lengths, a horizontal condensation, which increases the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, inspection wells constructed using concrete inspection of wells are not easily collapsing, sinking, leaking etc., and the wall wall of wells are mechanically stable, simple to operate, sized.
Concrete inspection wells module Brick device smart control data entry, output device a touch-to-touch LCD displays the entire operation of the monitoring machine, achieves the desired human dialogue, auto-analysing the match, density operation, security logical control and failure diagnostic system.
The surface wall module mechanical hydraulic system uses single-cylinder hydraulics, transports, double-cylinder hydraulics, transports.
Independent hydraulic integration stations avoid the effects of host vibrations on hydraulic systems, thereby ensuring the reliability of hydraulic systems.
Concrete inspection wells modular brick seter material boxes have been de-modelled, storage doors closed and transmission pads independently of the hydraulic system, thus reducing mechanical wear and maintenance.
Concrete inspection wells module brick machine equipment is used for imported computers, electrical appliances, seals, hydraulics, and paraplegic equipment is stable and reliable in combination.
The mechanical stimulus platform of the wall module of the well wall uses a whole plate steel, and the surface line is cut to the unwelded point, allowing the filling box to move freely and to reduce the mechanical wear and tear.
Reduction of the mold load, fillings and double-encrypted amplitudes, integration, full synchronization, vibrations, emulations, ensuring a positive effect.
The wall wall module mechanically stimulates machinery, computer auto-control amplitude adjusts amplitudes based on raw material value, without wear and tear, thereby extending the useful life and reducing costs.
Auto-controlled and manual control of the well wall module.
Checking well molds:
The Xinjiang machine checks the cement-based table for the well:
At the corner of the Io-Kin workshop:
Inspection of production and processing equipment for the concrete module of wells
The JUNI Brick module is designed to produce, in addition to inspecting well blocks, various tiles, empty heart bricks, street bricks.

Chongqing is piloting modern apprenticeships.
Yesterday, journalists learned from the City Council that starting this year, our city will pilot a modern apprenticeship model in 60 secondary schools, that students who have been trained on a pilot basis will also have apprenticeship status and that enrolment will be pre-recorded as employees of the pilot enterprise.
The Municipal Council requires that the procedures for admission to secondary schools and for the employment of enterprises be regulated, that the dual status of students and business associates of apprentices be clarified, and that tripartite agreements be concluded between apprentices, schools and enterprises, in accordance with the principle of two-way selection, and that for apprentices who have not attained the age of 18 years at the age of 16, they be signed by apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises in order to determine the rights and interests of the parties and the specific positions in which the apprentices are employed, the content of teaching, the protection of rights and interests, etc.
The pilot schools are encouraged to conduct pre-service and trans-service training for employees of enterprises in the form of modern apprenticeships and joint cooperative ventures.
The pilot school needs to reform the talent development model.
Schools jointly design talent development programmes and jointly develop professional teaching and learning standards, curriculum standards, job standards, entrepreneurial master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation programmes.
The pilot is a pilot cycle with a traineeship system, and the duration of the student ' s internship in the enterprise is determined in accordance with the professional talent development programme, usually for a period of six months.
In the practice of enterprises, an enterprise class management model should be implemented whereby, depending on the characteristics of the different professions, a teacher can bring two to five pupils to form study groups to ensure that students are skilled in the skills required for each shift.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 until August 2019, we identified in three batches 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeships, each with a number of 50 or so people, with a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices).
In accordance with the principle of piloting and scaling-up, exploring the establishment of joint school-enterprise recruitment, joint training, integration of long-term mechanisms for the upbringing of the human being, effective upgrading of skills in student posts and improvement of the employment rate and quality of employment of student counterparts.

The China Children's Center will hold a series of events to get children to "high technology" over "6-1" - Xinhuanet
Xinhua Society Beijing 20 May (Hang Xiaoxi Chow Shan) journalist learned from China's Children's Centre on May 28th to June, the China Children's Centre plans to organize a series of activities such as children's creative experiences, children's visual arts festivals, parents' books and books, and the Chinese Children's Centre's Day, which will allow children to enjoy the charms of front-line technology.
It is known that the activities of the Chinese Children ' s Centre during the Children ' s Day of this year include "Friends To Cool" children ' s future studies in carnivals, the first Children ' s Visual Arts Festival, the "Hands to Read" event, the "Friends to Read" series.
The Deputy Director General of the China Children's Centre, Li Jong-min, introduced the 20th "6th" Children's Day media conference, which was held in China on the occasion of the Chinese Children's Centre's 6th Day.
Activities are aimed at integrating social innovation with individual family creativity and at making innovative practices the cultural genes of the general family and "do it" the new learning and lifestyle of the larger family through the participation of children and families in innovative educational activities.
According to the information received, the future of "Friendly Crook" children's studies includes the experience of the "Bean Fruit Maker" experience, the "Foundation of Old Cow Children's Explorer" and the "Exploration of the Family Love" initiative, the VR Universal Experience programme, and dozens of cutting-edge science and technology experiences such as the "Charlie Tribe" interactive workshop.

Dr. South Africa: The Omikian transmission is strong, but it's mostly mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the new coronary virus has a milder disease than the Delta variant, although it is spreading faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omikian mutant in South Africa, a group of over 5,000 doctors in Haudun Province in South Africa reported that the symptoms of new coronary patients they are currently treating are mild, such as physical pain and cough similar to influenza.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the head of the organization, said that he visited dozens of patients every day, but no patient needed to be hospitalized.
" They can control the disease at home, and most of them recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation... "
He said that this included elderly patients and those with health problems, who were more likely to suffer from coronary infection.
In contrast, he said, in the last wave of Delta's outbreak, he treated the new coronary with "respiratory difficulties and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people are hospitalized in a few days " .
Similar experiences were shared by other doctors in the two weeks following the first reporting of the Omicium mutation strain in southern Africa.
Although it will take weeks to collect sufficient data, the doctor ' s observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30 per cent of new patients who have been hospitalized in recent weeks are seriously ill, which is half of the rate of acute illness in the previous wave; the average length of hospitalization has been reduced from 8 to 2.8 days; and only 3 per cent of recent new cases have died, compared to 20 per cent of early outbreaks in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, Director of the African Institute of Health, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports: " Currently, almost all signs indicate that this is a milder disease ... "
He also said, " It's still early. We need to get some later data.
Normally, hospitalisation and death take place later, and we've only been in this wave for two weeks ... "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the efficacy of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta remains the world ' s leading new nuclear strain, Omikian cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the centre of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the first week of December saw an increase of 400 per cent in new cases in Haudun Province, with tests showing that more than 90 per cent of Omicium variants were recorded.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been delivered!

Education time reviews: What is the basis for saving abducted children?
If we compare the famous public service ads "no business, no killing" to "no business, no crime", then in a good environment of "take-and-take" demand, there will be no recurrence of such crimes, in the absence of a "take-and-take" environment, against crowd control, against the whole population, making trafficking unprofitable, risky and costly.
In recent days, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security has launched a platform for the urgent dissemination of information on the disappearance of children, which has been developed by the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security.
This is the Internet information platform created to establish authoritative channels for the dissemination of information on the disappearance of children and the timely recovery of abducted children.
I hear this app's name is "reunification", and it's very warm.
New technology means are not only "artistic " , full of emotions, but well-used, practical and effective.
The primary objective of the abduction law enforcement is to find the abducted child and to protect his physical integrity and freedom.
Second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishments, social prevention to legal education, can be cited in many terms.
However, priority should be given to the physical safety of victims before cases of trafficking are solved.
The priorities, the much-needed "resorted" objective, such as "whether trafficking in children should always be punishable by death", and the much-disputed topic, can be suspended and carefully discussed; but the rescue of abducted children cannot be done.
Based on experience with the investigation of such cases, traffickers tend to stay away from the crime scene as soon as they can.
One minute more delay in the search, the child may be further away from the parents, and the difficulty of detecting a case increases.
In this case, it would be pragmatic to come up with an effective way, like a "reunification" platform, that would directly assist in the detection of cases and the recovery of children.
After all, "kidnapping" is a big task that needs to be done by operating the entire system of the rule of law.
Combating crime, safeguarding the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the guarantee of justice, to the strict application of the law, without the need to carry out the care of the child.
Moreover, the prevention of child trafficking, from family to society, can do better.
For example, in a common case, three families rested at a train station, their parents fell asleep, and they woke up and the baby was gone.
A two-year-old cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, he or she should be at least reasonably protective.
The two parents are the minimum means of preventing the abduction of a child, taking turns to rest or placing the child under secure protection.
On the other side of the police fight against trafficking, the purchase of abducted children should also be noted and punished.
Individual wrongdoings are often only part of a long chain.
According to our Criminal Code, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking is five years; in particularly serious cases, the death penalty may be imposed and property confiscated.
The crime of child trafficking is clearly considered a more severe offence under the trend towards "light punishment" with a high point of commencement and maximum punishment.
But there are still a lot of cases of trafficking every year.
So, some of them have a poor perception of parenting and a low legal awareness.
The legal education of this group should be synchronized.
Effectively controlling the crime of trafficking cannot be done through strict official law enforcement alone.
If the "market" of abduction is widespread, the traffickers are motivated and constantly inventive, creating a situation of "fighting" with law enforcers, it will be ineffectual.
Therefore, breaking down backward attitudes and spreading legal literacy can also help to combat trafficking and child trafficking.
Yang Hodong's presentation on the spirit of the 19th plenary session of the Party and the Provincial Party Congress in Marangshan
Draw strength from the party's centennial struggle.
On the morning of 10 December, in accordance with the unified arrangements of the Provincial Council, the Hunan daily newspaper (a media-wide journalist, Gombwe), the Provincial Council Standing Committee, the Minister of Communication, Yang Hodong, gave an interactive presentation at the Maroon Hill Video Innovation Park to learn more about the implementation of the spirit of the 19th plenary session of the Party, the spirit of the Xi Jinping General Secretary ' s important message to Hunan, and the spirit of the 12th Party Congress of the Province.
Yang Hodong, from his idealistic beliefs and his original mission, self-revolution and the Youth Party, party leaders and party theories, and in combination with his own consciousness, personal experience, deep-seated and systematic interpretation of the core tenets and practical requirements of the spirit of the plenary.
He pointed out that the spirit of the plenary and Xi Jinping General Secretary were important instructions for the important speeches to be delivered in Hunan, that the spirit of the Provincial Party Councils was combined to learn, that the spirits of the Parliamentary Councils were integrated, that they strengthened the defence of the "two established" and that the idea of "two preservations" was self-conscious, political conscious, acting conscious and determined to follow the direction of Xi Jinping General Secretary.
During the interactive segment, representatives of grass-roots cadres, business representatives, youth representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historic resolutions, how to understand the decisive meaning of the two established resolutions, how cultural enterprises were guided, how young people of the new era could draw strength from the centennial history of the party, how to use popular language in Yang Hodong, how to respond to vivid examples, and how to draw strength from the party's 100-year struggles, how to be closely united around the center of the party, how to stay with the party, and how to write responsibilities and commitments with youth dedication.

The restaurant always said it was being processed.
I waited a few hours.
The International Olive Oil Association has classified olive oil into two major categories, Virginia Olive Oil, and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil, at five levels.
The initial extraction of olive oil, or what is known as natural olive oil, is the oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruit, which is made of mechanical cooling, filtered, etc.
There are three levels depending on acidity:
Extra Virgin: The highest-level, highest-quality olive oil, pure natural product.
It's excellent. It's got the plant fragrance of a peatrician, with no more than 1% acid.
Fine Virgin: slightly higher but not more than 2% acid, pure taste, fragrance.
Ordinary primary olive oil (Ordinary Virginia): Taste and flavour are good, acidic at no more than 3.3%.
A refined olive oil is an olive oil obtained as a result of the refining of first-fried olive oil with more than 3.3 per cent acidity, or as a secondary oil.
The refining of olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive Oil: The refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of fresh-fried olive oil to reconcile the taste with colour, with acidity below 1.5% and transparent in the form of light gold and yellow.
Refinement of olive impurity or olive slag oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): olive oil extracted from the oil slag and refined by dissolved methods.
You should've seen the acidity of olive oil as a very important indicator.
You know, olive fruit is like grapes made of wine from different production areas, olive fruit from different olive fruit varieties, producing different standards of olive oil.
Best growing place for olive oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most appropriate soil and temperature for oil olive growth, weather conditions such as solar, air moisture and precipitation.
With the exception of the Mediterranean coast, the rest of the region can only grow on a sporadic basis in suitable areas.
Main areas of production (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., with climate similar to that of Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and so on.
The month of the olive harvest:
In March-June of each year, the olive trees bloom, the fruits begin to grow and mature in July-October, and the fruits move from green to red, purple and, finally, black.
November to February is the fruit harvest season.
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oils are rich in unsaturated fatty acids, i.e. oily acids and oily acids, nitrites, vitamins A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the best oil for human nutrients in the oil found so far.
At the end of the Democratic Summit, Biden called the Fire of Freedom unending.
The online Democracy Summit, convened by President Biden of the United States and attended by Governments from 110 countries, civil society and private sector leaders around the world, ended on Friday (10 December).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom was burning in the hearts of everyone in the world and that authoritarian regimes could never put it out.
He also said that the second Global Democracy Summit was planned for next year.
Taiwan's government representative, Councillor Tang Feng and Hong Kong Democratic Human Rights activists currently in exile in the United Kingdom also addressed the next day's summit.
And Biden said, " We know how hard the work before us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because I said before, as this summit showed, the democratic world is everywhere.
The authoritarian regime will never put out the fire of freedom, burning in the hearts of people around the world and around the world ... "
Biden also stated that the defence of democracy requires the joint efforts of society as a whole.
He said: " As leaders of government, it is our duty to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the shield of democracy, to promote reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resilient to the forces of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good ... "
The themes of the second day of the Democracy Summit were, respectively, the defence of human rights, the consolidation of democracy and the right of confrontation, and the fight against digital powerism and the affirmation of democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Guterres, in his opening address on the same day, also stated that the cause of democracy faced global challenges, particularly those posed by emerging digital technologies.
He said: " It is time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience ...
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires the firm condemnation of all forms of populism, indigenousism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution ... "
The Hong Kong Democratic Human Rights Activists, Mr. Rao, addressed the Summit via a pre-recorded video alerting participants to the human rights situation of the Chinese minority, such as Hong Kong and the Uighur and Tibetan communities.
He said: " For a long time, the world has accepted the rise of China without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable ...
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our primary task ... "
Rocunji also called for the free world to unite against the threats of the Communist Party.
He said, " Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, or maybe some of you do not realize the threat to our democratic values. "
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. "
In a round-table discussion on "Combating digital dictatorship, affirming democratic values", Taiwan 's Executive Council Member Tang Feng issued a "State Statement" by video highlighting Taiwan 's position at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and power.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the new coronary epidemic through transparency of information and building mutual trust.
He said: " At a time when democracy in Taiwan is rising, we remain firmly at the forefront of the global confrontation against authoritarianism and, more importantly, in the promotion of global freedom, democracy and human rights ...
During the epidemic, powerful governments everywhere justified human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
In Taiwan, however, we can control the epidemic without sealing the city, and we can defeat false information without taking the fall. "
In parallel with the second day of the Democratic Summit, the U.S. Treasury announced the imposition of legal sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities of China, North Korea and several other countries found to be responsible for serious human rights violations, and the imposition of investment restrictions on a Chinese company found to be using surveillance techniques to assist in human rights violations.

I know.

Anyway, I'm not yelling anymore.
I'm not eating.
I'll file a complaint.
Why didn't you say so earlier?
I waited so long for you.
No, I didn't get the call.
Please call him and send him back to our office.
I don't want to wait another minute.
A meal and an hour and a half.
#PRS_ORG# has not been delivered
I want to cancel the order.
Why didn't you cancel it?
Hello. The saliva chicken from the restaurant is raw.
I wanted to try tennis, but I didn't think I'd make it, so I thought I'd find someone who could do something like that first.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices are often proportional to the level of friendship, and if you cannot distinguish, the expensive normal situation is more friendly than cheap beats, and this kind of "introduction" is actually industrial garbage.
They're low-intensity, they're high on the beats, they're very vibrating, they're too hard to hold.
Their logic and subterranean words are -- you know, tennis is so hard, you can't learn, you know you don't want to buy expensive, you get a cheap one, you play twice, you don't play again, so it's cheap and you don't feel sorry for it.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you're making progress. I'll buy the expensive ones. I'll make two.
It's recommended to spend a similar price, buy a better second-hand bat, choose Prince, or Dunlop. These two brands aren't famous enough, so they don't sell.
It's kind of friendly with newcomers, but it's hard to get past the newcomers, but most people, especially girls, can't get through the newcomers.
The orders have been delayed several times.
May I help you follow up?
Postponement
Thank you.
So, I've got the credit?
Do I have to reschedule next? Did I leave that one alone?
Hello, I ordered food from this restaurant, but there's a lot of food missing from the delivery, and the saliva chicken is raw.
Please cancel it for no reason.
The only thing I'm asking for is delivery. There's no such thing as taking it from myself.

Xinhua All-China + Beijing Youth Hockey League for Winter Olympics - Xinhua Network

Girls raise money for their sister as arrows: " Think of it as flesh or flesh. " - Xinhuanet.
A girl at Wulin Square in Hangzhou stands in front of a big wooden board with the words "human target, ten dollar arrow".
Last morning, a photo of a Hangzhou girl who's been collecting money for her sister's sake blew up a circle of friends.
The photos show a girl standing in front of a little taller board at Wulin Square in Hangzhou, with the words "human target, ten dollar arrow" written on the board, indicating that the roadman can shoot with a bow and arrow when he pays.
The act triggered a lively discussion among the online community.
Last night, the chief of the propaganda department of the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Newjing press that the police had confirmed that the girl had made such an excess of money for her sister, but that such an act was not worth promoting, and that the girl had left the local police station yesterday after being warned.
The girl's street "Arrow Target" was warned to raise money.
In the online picture, a long hair girl stood in front of a big board with black ink with the words "human meat target, ten dollar arrow", a bank account and micromail, payment of treasure number, etc. on the other board.
The image is on the Internet and it's controversial.
Some netizens think it's "brow-eyed begging" and a lot of them feel sorry for it.
"We found out when we patrolled the square around 10 a.m. 23th, when the crowd was already watching... "
In an interview with the local media, the civilian police of the Tianhua police station near the scene stated that there were two girls in the booth, both of whom were about 20 years old, dressed in a young dress.
Among them, the girl who was a human target was crying and asked the roadman to play the game; the other girl was drinking on the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of surgery, so please help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou to learn that the girl was collecting funds for the treatment of leukemia... "
Last night, the chief of propaganda at the Lower City Division of Hangzhou City Public Security told the New King newspaper that the girl was named Ji Jigari and raised money for her sister Jigyan.
But because treatment still takes more than 300,000 dollars, it's not a good way to raise money.
He said that, throughout the process, two girls had been targeted, one had been shot, but not involved, and no arrows had been found in the process, except that someone had watched and taken photographs and sent them to the microblogging site.
Then the police, after being certified by the security services, used bows and arrows that were not subject to control.
The responsible person stated that " this kind of eye-to-eye fund-raising is not promoted " ...
She left the police station after the police officers warned her.

It's not bad. It smells real.
What's the hottest in 2021?
It's definitely the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympics can win an award?
There's an article "Look, the project manager can hit the gold medal's Olympic project" in the early part of the day, which says that the project managers can be the first in many projects, and no one can be the first to do it: move bricks, travel, stay up all night is the day of the project manager, fight the fire, take the fall, apologize the wrong way.
It's like a joke article, but it's about the project manager's day-to-day stench, and it's about the power of the current project management.
And the people involved in project management are gradually choosing to take action to get themselves out of the difficult situation at work.
In terms of the number of registered PMPs (internationally certified project management professionals) that rise each year, an increasing number of project management practitioners are learning to upgrade their project management capabilities.
According to China's 20-year Development Report on Project Management (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP candidates nationwide was nearly 600,000, the number certified through PMP was approximately 420,000, and the number of valid witnesses was about 300,000, representing 31.2 per cent of the total number of PMPs worldwide.
The annual growth in the number of PMP holders over the past 10 years suggests that more project managers are realizing that it is no longer desirable to do things by simply replicating "old experience" and that a rapidly changing working environment gives us an idea of how to learn to stand on the shoulders of the scientific giants and explore the way forward.
However, would the PMP make it possible for project management to go smoothly?
Many project management starters have suggested that learning courses such as PMP/IPMP allows for a systematic mastery of knowledge points such as the 10 major areas of project management and the five process groups, but the real project management process is still a mess.
(c) Lack of a systematic project management process system, insulation, project predictions, lack of control sensitivity and delays in the project;
As a result, more than a decade of focus on product innovation and R & D management has helped a large number of excellent enterprises to develop a large number of product managers, key R & D talent, such as project managers, and have received a course on the "Special Training Camp for R & D Project Managers" online from China 'Congregation Training Model for Chinese Enterprise R & D Managers'.
The "R & D Project Manager's Special Camp" online course, which is a way of learning on-line fragmentation, combines the field cases, tools and methods of many R & D enterprises to help you master the knowledge and standard actions required of the project manager and move on to the path of your own project management.
It is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and fewer inputs to facilitate the process of developing project managers and bring efficient results to the enterprise.
This course is not only a team of experts from China, China, the research and development management team, but also an in-depth professional presentation of the content of the course, taking into account the advanced international project management methodology and the real business scenes of many well-known enterprises.
It provides scientific and practical management tools and methods, a wealth of template forms to help participants translate learning into specific work after class.

On the eve of the "two-twelf" of Tzeto, promote rational consumption to consumers - economic watch - professional financial news site
This year's Twin 11 Carnival National Network paid $177 trillion in business transactions, up from previous years.
Once again, consumers benefit from the proliferation of red packs and live feeders, which, while exaggerating the strength of national consumption, have to calmly reflect on the impact of consumerism on society and on the mainstream consumer groups of our time.
On the eve of the two-twelf, Tzeshin Consumer Finance Co. Ltd. (hereinafter " Tzein " ) launched a rational consumption initiative to alert users, especially young people, to develop good consumption awareness and habits and to reject blind consumption and overconsumption.
According to the "Analytical Report on the Survey of Consumer Financial Literacy", published this year by the People's Bank, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
In general, our inhabitants perform better at the level of financial consumption, but there are significant differences in the different aspects of financial behaviour and skills, and there is a need to further upgrade basic financial knowledge.
The level of financial literacy of older persons and adolescents is relatively low, and "Aging and young people" will continue to be the focus of sustained attention in financial education; the "Report on the Status of China's Young People's Debt", published by Nelson, and the "China Youth Consumption Report 2019-2020", published by the Treasury, show that the younger generation has enormous consumption potential, credit consumption becomes an important route to rising consumption, that 86.6 per cent of young people are using credit products, that nearly half have no accumulated debt, and that while the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend that is quite different from the "excessive" label, some young people do over-consumption, followed by wind consumption behaviour, which has led to excessive financial pressure and debt risk and even to a gradual increase in social problems, and that financial enterprises should be socially responsible and direct.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Tatsushi has been working to build a happy life for people with quality and thoughtful services, to advocate for good and correct consumer perceptions and to respond positively to regulatory calls for practical action to raise consumer awareness of rational consumption, especially among young people.
In the past few years, Tetsu has been carrying out a comprehensive and diversified financial literacy campaign targeting youth groups, including university students, and has helped them to build rational consumption, thereby helping them to build up their own wealth through various forms of diversion, such as competitions for innovation and practice, in cooperation with the country ' s top institutions.
At the dawn of the binary, Tzeto reminds all consumer friends to develop a reasonable sense of consumption and correct monetary outlook, to resist blind consumption and overconsumption, and to avoid misunderstandings in consumer lending, so as not to affect personal correspondence and future economic life.
You have to plan ahead and pay back on time.
If overdue, the overdue records will be recorded in personal credit reports, which may have a negative impact on future economic life, such as the purchase of cars and houses.
At the same time, access to financial products and services should be accompanied by the choice of formal institutions and channels, and care should be taken to verify the qualifications of the institutions concerned.
In the future, Tzeto will, as always, build on its maturity, a reliable consumer financial system and constantly up-to-date financial products to bring more demand-friendly and diversified services to consumers, constantly help raise the level of financial literacy among the general public, help them develop rational consumption, the concept of modest borrowing, and be a trusted consumer financial partner throughout their lives.

Viet Nam People ' s News Network -- Gulf Cooperation Council to address common challenges
The stay of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman includes Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UA), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this was the first visit of Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since the imposition of an embargo on Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies in 2017, which led to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf States signed an agreement to mediate between the United States and Kuwait towards "Solidarity and Stability".
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt, through their appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar, are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar.
The Arab States of the Gulf resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar out of the demands that must be united for the benefit of all States and for regional stability, in order to meet common challenges ...
During this visit to Oman, the Saudi Crown Prince agreed to open the first direct land route between the two neighbouring Gulf States.
A 725-kilometre-long link between the two countries will facilitate the movement of citizens of both countries and the integration of the supply chain.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and 13 memorandums of understanding for cooperation worth $30 billion have been signed between enterprises in both countries.
The Saudi Crown Prince’s visit to the Gulf countries coincided with negotiations between Iran and the world’s major Powers to salvage the Iranian nuclear agreement called the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan (JCPOA) – an agreement condemned by the Gulf Arab States for their inability to resolve the missile problem with Iran.
The Gulf States have always regarded Iran as a long-standing "competing opponent " and have viewed Iran ' s nuclear programme as a threat to regional security " ...
The Gulf States believe that failure to resolve the Iranian missile issue and to take action to curb Iran ' s activities in the region is flawed.
In the context of the failure of the major Powers to meet the aspirations of the Gulf States to nuclear negotiations with Iran, Saudi Arabia has entered into direct negotiations with Iran ...
The goal is to contain the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors that slows economic growth in the GCC countries.
The forthcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of GCC States since the dispute between some member States and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic results that have contributed to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully in meeting common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

It's called the New Mountain Super Run with the biggest exhaust noise!
The car that our team brought to us this time is the dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship, Murcielago's replacement model -- Aventador LP 700-4!
It's worth nearly two million, ten thousand dollars a year, four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP 700?
Because you have 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
The data says that an acceleration of 0-100 km/h takes 2.9 seconds, and that's probably when he got to 30 km/h, he's 100 km/h.
The low body of the car, the scissors door, the huge vents around the car, and the glass's next and full of 6.5 v12 engines, are the perfect interpretation of Lamborghini's style.
You don't have to talk too much about the description of the car, just google yourself, make up a few little things that Google doesn't have to explain!
Too much attention. Everyone's watching wherever they go. It's uncomfortable!
1 km gas money around R.M. 1
Get up and get out of the car and practice, or it'll be a little awkward.
The engine sounds too loud to be deaf when you get out of the car.
It's too big, it's too narrow in a regular parking lot to get knocked over by the next car when it opens!
It's a little lonely because there's no match on the road.
Don't get me wrong. This video's run is not for sale. I'm sorry!
Friends who want to film your favorite car, welcome to contact us!
More car information you don't know about.
It's about a million-dollar car accident!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that Chiron is one of the most expensive runners in the world, and Porsche 911 is worth millions!
A few minutes before that day, a million cars were hit in a few minutes abroad, 9/11, and a million overruns.
Look at the results, it makes sense!
Resonance of university spirits with the spirit of the times - Xinhuanet
The spirit of university is a set of philosophy and value-seeking ideas that a university has developed over a long period of time, and that is where the spirit of the university lies.
Since ancient times, university spirit has been crucial to politics, the economy, culture, science and technology, the development of society and even the advancement of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have taken on a unique mission, unlike other social organizations, and for our universities, the spirit of the autumn of national distress has been deeply influenced by traditional cultures and changing times, advocating the values of "Ming Deziz" and the patriotism of "The Power of the Emergence".
At present, there is a growing trend towards informationization and internationalization of higher education, global competition for education, competition for technology, increasing competition for talent, higher education as an important " supply side " , and structural reforms are facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the introduction of the General Programme for the Integrated Advancement of World First Class Universities and First Class Studies, while demonstrating the country's confidence and determination to move from a high-level to a high-level-education country, is a much more up-to-date requirement for university development.
How can efforts be made to become the world ' s most popular in a relatively short period of time and to speed up the construction of a number of world-class universities and groups of world-class disciplines, on the basis of the remaining gaps, to achieve a " turn-by-bust " ?
In addition to a strong sense of self-confidence in purpose, road confidence, ability and confidence, institutions of higher learning should take full advantage of three main advantages: one is to achieve a significant improvement in academic standards and the quality of education through the continuous introduction of outstanding academic talent from abroad, drawing on the best experiences of world leading universities; the other is cultural superiority, which is to bring about a cohesiveness, branding and image enhancement by inheriting the intellectual content of Chinese civilization’s 5,000-year-old heritage of excellence; and the third is institutional superiority, taking advantage of the institutional superiority of socialist countries, reinforcing the drive of objectives, pooling consensus, optimizing resource allocation and providing sustainable and solid guarantees for schools to accelerate their catching up to the world’s advanced levels.
In particular, it is important to realize that building world-class universities is unlikely to be the same, and that schools, while playing an advantage, must show their personality and identity.
The features of the school must be Chinese in common and reflect their unique objectives, traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we have focused on three main features in our activities: one is to highlight the characteristics of innovative entrepreneurship development, build the integration of science and education, integrate the human environment into the school community, and form an entrepreneurship education ecosystem across the chain; the other is to highlight the cross-cutting nature of disciplines, promote the optimal adaptation of the system of disciplines, create an institutional environment of cross-disciplinary disciplines, actively foster new and emerging disciplines and emblematic cross-cutting outcomes; and the third is to highlight the characteristics of the school system and social services, develop in-depth international exchanges and accelerate the formation of a collaborative system of cross-cutting research and development.
In this process, it is particularly important to maintain the spirit of the university and to bring it together with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, "Renovation" is the latest expression of Zhejiang spirit.
This is an important guarantee of the school ' s commitment to the right course, its growing cultural highness, its spiritual strength, its richness and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Heinar River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and tolerance, expressed in the hearts of "the world's best talent for me" and expressed in the ideas of learning from the world's famous schools of excellence; "In good faith" emphasizes the spirit of truth and goodness, meaning that universities, while pursuing the truth, are more deserving of the virtues of pottery and personality; "Inventors" reflect the spirit of innovation of change, which encompasses both the search for new knowledge and innovation in scientific research, and the development of reform and renewal; "The State of the Tree" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism, which says that universities should always be stigmatized with national destiny.
This series of spiritual ideas and values is the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
"The deaf hear the silent and the clear see the invisible " .
China’s higher education institutions have built on China’s unique socialist cause and have taken a deep grip on the place and place of higher education and its historic mission to speed up the construction of the world’s leading university.
At the same time, upholding humanism and freedom of independence, allowing the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times and the spirituality of the nation to interact with each other, thus providing a relentless impetus for the country ' s prosperity and national renewal and the realization of the common ideals of humanity.

When the NFT fire broke out, the encryption community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a block chain game called "Axie Infinity" had a tremendous impact in South-East Asia, where some residents who lost their jobs as a result of the epidemic began to earn a steady income.
"Axie Infinity" is a game of pets based on block chain technology, which brings together a variety of games, including NFT, the most traded NFT project, which has now reached more than $3 billion.
TokenTerminal data show that Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million a day to push the King's Glory.
On August 6th this year, Axie Infinity officially claimed that its daily users were over 1 million.
The heat of "Axie Infinity" passes a new "pallytoearn" model to more people, and through the help of block chains and smart contracts, players are no longer single players, and can be involved in the management of game ecology in addition to having fun and economic benefits from the game.
This primaryity is not conferred by the game maker, but by the technology of the block chain.
When I see a news about the price of a friend's share, my biggest feeling is the choice of an enterprise in the track, i.e., the choice of an investment target industry, first of all, to grow up in a space-rich industry of at least 100 billion market sizes; secondly, to choose a sector that will grow well in the future, to consider an industry that will grow optimally in the next 3-5 years; and finally, to choose a sector that is supported by policy.
The length of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage in which the industry is developing, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the pattern of competition in the industry.
Let's go for the right track!
The first thing in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
Tactics are "do the things right," which means doing things right.
And the strategy is "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find direction, the tactics are to land, and there is a space for strategic thinking over most tactical thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), it is possible to think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or lateral (strategic thinking); on how to increase the retention rate of core and high-value customers (strategic thinking), for example, to think about raising the retention rate of core customers (tactical thinking); on increasing activity participation (tactical thinking), it is possible to consider how to set the right activity KPI to achieve the right activity objectives, such as increasing the participation of target customers, activating high-value silencers and scalding new ones; and on upgrading the DAU (tactical thinking), it is possible to consider whether current growth is healthy and sustainable.
In the 12th year of birth, Bitcoin reached several milestones in 2021.
On 7 September, the small country of Central America, El Salvador, established Bitcoin as the legal currency, which was the first national or regional currency.
On 12 October, ProShares first approved the launch of the Bitcoin ETF in eight years and placed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking a further expansion of the exposure of encrypted currency investments by the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to United States capital markets.
Bitcoin wasn't the main player in terms of the technological development of the block chain.
On 14 November 2021, Bitcoin conducted a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of blocks themselves.

American Asian groups complain of discrimination in the admission of three Ivy schools, Yale and others - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Washington, 23 May, U.S.A., has filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on 23 May against three Ivy League schools – Yale, Brown University and Dartmouth College – which discriminate against Asian applicants in their admission process.
The Asian Education Alliance, which led the launch of the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
At the launch meeting, the chairman of the group, Zhao Woo-won, said that "the number of Asian applicants who have met the criteria for admission to American schools has increased exponentially over the past 0 years, but the proportion of Asians in these three American schools has remained essentially at the same level.
Many studies show that these colleges, in the process of admission to the so-called "comprehensive consideration", " long-term continuity and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants " .
According to Zhao Woo-won, research by scholars like Sanders in 20'4 showed that Asians had the lowest rate of admission among all ethnic groups in the three colleges.
Data from the United States Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest rates of admission to Asian students, and Yale and Brown universities have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Woo-won told Xinhua's reporter that they expected the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice to investigate after filing a complaint and, after finding out the facts, take measures to prevent these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions.
They also look forward to receiving complaints that the higher education institutions will be able to take the issue into their own initiative and change their policy on the admission of Asians.
At present, the three higher education institutions complained of have not responded.
The Asian Education Alliance was founded in 20'5 when it complained of discrimination at Harvard University, but the United States Department of Education did not admit it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American group, the petition included American Indian, Korean, Japanese, Pakistani educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu had learned from the agent of the house that there was a factory in the town of Yao Yu, Zhejiang, and after several live visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy it.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu made a down payment of $200,000 by bank transfer on the same day after consulting with the owner ' s family on the details of the purchase of the plant.
"If the buyer does not want to buy the plant, the down payment is paid to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell the plant, the down payment is returned to the seller twice, and the parties agree to conclude the contract within a week. "
However, the subsequent failure of the parties to agree on key contractual terms such as the scope of the sale of the plant and the manner of payment resulted in delays in the conclusion of the purchase and sale of the house.
In view of the failure of the parties to reach a consensus on the terms of the contract, a few days later Lin had returned the deposit of $200,000 to Mr. Lu.
It's hard to see the house, it's a deposit, it's ready, it's a contract, and the seller doesn't sell it, which makes Mr. Lui insolent and angry.
To that end, Mr. Lu has brought a case against Mr. Lin to the Yao City People ' s Court.
The Court considered that the parties had ultimately failed to conclude a formal contract, could not be blamed solely on the accused, should reasonably be presumed not to have been able to consult, so that in the present case the penalty should not apply and the defendant should not be held liable for breach of contract for double the amount of the deposit.
After the first instance judgement, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the sentence.
[Lawyer] Do the necessary due diligence in the course of the transaction.
When signing a contract, the buyer has the necessary due diligence obligation to verify information on the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, etc., and to specify in the contract the specific time of delivery, the place of delivery, in order to prevent disputes between the parties in the performance of the contract ...
On Friday, after the "Democracy Summit" the spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement stating that the United States hosted the "Leader Democracy Summit" on Saturday (11 December), which was "to use ideological strategizing, weaponizing, defaming democracy as anti-democratic, inciting divisive confrontations and diverting domestic conflicts " .
In the view of the Chinese Government, " the United States has long imposed its own political system and values, pursued a " democratic transformation " , imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and promoted a " colour revolution " with disastrous consequences ...
"Democracy" has long been a "weapons of mass destruction" for United States intervention in other countries.
This summit is Biden's move to honour his campaign commitments.
The two-day meeting took place in a video format, with the participation of leaders of 111 countries around the world, including Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States on the basis of its own democratic emergence, claiming that the United States was not in a position to host such a summit.
But there are also international and domestic questions, such as criticism of the participation of leaders of authoritarian tendencies, such as those of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, who suspect that the true intention of the Biden Government was not to organize the summit for the sake of democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The new German Chancellor Scholtz also participated in the Video Democracy Summit.
The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China on Saturday states that " today ' s American democracy is becoming more and more sick, money-based, identity-based, political parties are opposing, political polarization, society is tearing apart, ethnic strife, and the rich and poor are divided " , and that American democracy is a capital-based " game of rich people " .
In his statement, the President of the United States, Biden, said, " It is our duty, as leaders of our Government, to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the democratic fence, to promote reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resilient to the forces of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good ... "
He stressed that democracy is not automatic, " we must update it in every generation, which, in my view, is the defining challenge of our time ... "
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "in the face of persistent and worrisome challenges, democracy requires fighters to defend it " .
The United States, for its part, committed itself to a year-long initiative following this democratic summit, which includes a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that States will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the substantive democracy summit planned for the end of 2022 ...
Biden said, " Let us all implement our commitments and report on our progress next year " .
All right, I'm afraid he's got the wrong address.

Tastes good, meat good, service hot.
It's been such a long time since I've had daytime, and fruit is still so delicious, and the first fork-burning bag is the southern taste of the soft flour I love!
It's good enough to be dry, it's good enough, it's good as always, it's good soup, it's better to treat mustard...
Tastes good. Service hot. Meat good.
It's just that it's been a long time since I've been in the middle of the Internet, the East Building, the Wood Floor.
It's always a long time before you can eat the rice, and the casserole is broken...
It's been years since you've been eating the sun, and the rise of all kinds of pickles has dispersed the flow.
It's very rare to have a seat at the store, but it's not as good as ever.
It's delicious. Good meat. Good food.

[ Rice ] Eating: This food is a little disappointed.
Three cups of chicken: a little too much food and a little less chicken.

What's a red whiskey drink?
Everyone's interests are different, people like to collect, people like to eat, and, of course, people like to drink. Red whiskey is one of the best Scottish whiskey ever sold in every country, and red whiskey was awarded the International Wine Prize.
Every bottle of red whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, it ruins its ol.
What about red whiskey?
I'll give you a short introduction.
Red whiskey:
Jonny's red-coded whiskey is made of about 35 types of Scotch, with strong flavour and traditional Scotch quality, and sweet and smoked fragrances.
The entrances are fresh, with a little vanilla and a strong smell of smoked wheat.
The wine can be consumed directly with ice or in combination with the favorite drink.
Red whiskey has entered the country and, in order to adapt to the country's taste, bubble drinks like red whiskey + Coke or snowburst or New Wonders have become a constant fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to their medium and acidic taste, give people pleasure in visual terms, join them and change their taste with a light drink.
Red whiskey + sliced lemon + sugar (and sugar ) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
The real red flavour is a bit sour, the sugar can be added to it, and the lemon brings fresh flavour to the wine, although sweet acid can be adapted according to the taste of the person.
These three are the best wines of red whiskey, and you can try it as a reference, hoping that the introduction of the editor will help you.
Educational thinking: how university exams can make "jumper" and "dude" have their own -- Xinhuanet.
Three students from the Lanzhou Transport University wrote to the head of the school, reflecting confusion about the university examination and proposing to make it more difficult to change the subject of the examination and make it truly reflective of the actual level of students.
Indeed, for a long time, college exams were a hot topic.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with varying levels of competence, with varying degrees of learning.
It is inevitable that a group of people with such diverse characteristics should be tested with different feelings.
Of course, if the test topics were single, the repetition rate was high and the subject was too simple, it would inevitably give rise to another completely different feeling.
Students who don't have a job, they'll be able to do it before the exam, and if they think of anything else, they'll be able to do it twice as well.
In that case, there's a "student" that can pass without input or even getting a high score; a "student" who never leaves school, does his homework, has a good notebook, doesn't get much higher than the " odd state of affairs" of the exam.
In this way, it appears that the problems in the university examinations are not without cause, and it is believed that this situation does not exist only in the state.
In this sense, I'd like to commend the three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, it's not unusual for anyone who's ever been to college to know that they're ready for a test, to think of any way to "get" a test from a teacher, try to draw a range of tests, get a "privileged tutor" before they get a test, even with a small copy of the exam, and it's not unusual to ask a teacher to raise his hand after the exam.
In the view of the author, as a quality assessment guide for teaching, the qualification of a university examination is measured by the teachers ' overall knowledge of teaching and learning and the scientific propositions on which it is based.
In the undergraduate stage, the specializations began to be broken down, and many of the specializations were based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that the basic knowledge of a discipline is the content of the university examination.
The basics of undergraduate knowledge are the fundamentals of the discipline and basic common sense, and in terms of knowledge, there is little room for change, which is essentially fixed.
As the teacher says, "The basics of university mathematics 20 years ago are still learning, or is it the focus... "
But the point of knowledge is essentially the same. It doesn't mean that the test is single. The test is repeated.
In many universities, examinations are usually organized into problem groups, combined with senior academic teachers, and the examination papers are attended by all the teachers who are responsible for the Section, thus overcoming some of the duplication of tests.
However, it is necessary to develop a set of practical teaching and learning tests, which are difficult to achieve in a normal manner depending on the student ' s overall learning situation, as well as an overview of the teaching situation and a comprehensive analysis of the student ' s level of learning, so that the subject matter of the examination is easy and dynamic in nature, highlighting both the basic knowledge and the ability to examine, while developing innovative design of the subject.
Examinations are the baton of university education and, with what kind of tests, students will have the appropriate preparatory programme, which, in the long run, will affect the effectiveness of university education.
With regard to letters of advice from students, the state of Lanzhou attached great importance to the school, and a rehabilitation programme had been deployed throughout the school.
The teaching units are required to organize a self-censorship examination and examination of the completion of the course, to develop the subject of the examination and the related system, and to strengthen the monitoring and inspection of the subject of the examination and the examination process, to refine the evaluation of the results, and to strengthen the comprehensive examination of the various components of the curriculum.
The institutional solution to the single type of test, the repetition of which is the subject of a university examination, requires, of course, the introduction of a corresponding system, but it is a daily matter that requires teachers to have complete knowledge of teaching, not only of teaching content, but also of students' learning, both of which will be better connected, good interaction between teaching and learning, and examination will be more realistic, so that "hegems" and "pastes" will have their share.

The photographer was very funny, too, and it was fun taking pictures all day long.
When we picked the photos, because we saw a lot of cases online and didn't want our customers to delete too many pictures, but really, when we picked the photos, we didn't even want to add them to the 24 of them, none of them.
Today's photo was fixed, Langland sent it to me, and I saw two of them that didn't feel good, and they fixed them for me right away.

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah have no paper for special protection against false paper.
According to the Sabah National Registration Office, since the beginning of October, it has been impossible to issue raw paper to newborn babies due to the use of special anti-false paper stocks, with a cumulative total of 3,200 people affected to date.
However, the Director of the Bureau, Kerou Aminus, assured that all babies who had applied for paper were recorded in the system and that the anti-false paper would be reissued when it arrived next week.
In a press conference, he explained that a 10-month story had been reported about the printing of Sabah newspaper paper by a web-based medium.
He said that the problem had arisen two months ago, and Sarawak faced the same problem.
" One of the reasons for this is the delayed arrival of Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-false paper in the country, which was affected by the epidemic ... "
He explained that the anti-false paper used in the Sabah paper was different from other areas and therefore could not be traded for inventory from other states.
Keru's Aminus revealed that the latest shipment of anti-false paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company for partial printing on 8th of this year.
" The Bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods and return to Sabah immediately for the final phase of printing. It is estimated that two more working days (20 December) will be available to the applicant ... "
"We'll notify the applicants to the local stations to collect paper... "
He added that Sabah has sent out 24,801 papers so far this year.
From 7:00 until now.
You're almost there, aren't you?
I'm talking about food.
I'm waiting on the other side of #PRS_ORG#.

48 hours of negative nucleic acid, buffer zone, State Department U.N.A. Control Mechanism sent a request to strengthen port city outbreak control - Xinhua Network
Xinhua Society, Beijing, 11 December, issued a circular on strengthening the prevention and control of new coronary pneumonia in the port city, issued by the State Council ' s joint control mechanism, requesting that personnel leaving the land border crossing city (except where there is a border with Hong Kong, Macao) should have a negative nucleic acid test within 48 hours, and that at least one nucleic acid test should be conducted upon arrival at the land border crossing city.
According to the circular, the time frame for the above-mentioned request is from the date on which the city of the port is determined and announced by the provinces and municipalities, until 15 March 2022.
In addition, it was suggested that the city of the port with conditions could study the establishment of a buffer zone for outbreak control within the jurisdiction.
The head of the National Health Council ' s Disease Prevention and Control Department described cross-border border trade as the main economic pillar of the local economy for some port cities, with frequent border crossings between the two sides.
The implementation of a differentiated management policy, from a barrier to two lines of protection, is expected to achieve pre-port migration and reduce the risk of spillage to minimize social impact and minimize social costs to maximize the effectiveness of outbreak control.
In recent times, there have been a number of home-grown concentrated outbreaks in the country, all of which have been imported through port cities.
According to the circular, this exposes a number of local outbreak surveillance alerts that are not timely, close management of high-risk personnel, regular nucleic acid detection in form, loss of access to cold chain items, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific precision in emergency response to the epidemic.
The circular requires that efforts be made in nine areas, including improving the mechanism for the prevention and control of urban outbreaks at ports, improving the early warning system for outbreak monitoring and implementing border control measures, expediting the completion of the short-screening of the city at ports, remaining undisturbed, scientific precision in the prevention and control of the disease, and woven into the perimeter of the outer-entry defence.
The circular stresses the need for cities at the ports to synchronize the prevention and control of the epidemic with the protection of human life, to synchronize its deployment, to publish and provide access to the Human Security Hotline, to regularly check the supply of basic living materials, price risks, etc., and to address and respond in a timely manner to salient questions from the public.
According to the circular, the port cities referred to therein include open land, water routes, the district (municipality, district, flag), the municipality (locality, state, union) and the municipality directly under its jurisdiction, in particular by the provinces (autonomous region, municipality directly under its authority) in accordance with the need to prevent and control the epidemic and to make timely announcements.

The oil pipe video brings up 20 years of bloodthirsty killing in the United States -- Xinhua Network.
(video source: pipeline)
On December 11th, a micro-film film called "The Killing Machine" from the pipeline was a cause for widespread concern.
The film describes the war against Afghanistan waged by the United States in the name of "anti-terrorism", the forced export of American-style democracy through war, 20 years of war, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing and crimes against humanity.
Misuse of drone strikes on hospitals, civilian sites such as schools, distortion of humanity and the formation of homicide squads.
For 20 years, the United States has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. forces set up Black Jails to inflict all kinds of torture and physical humiliation on the suspects.
A crime against humanity provokes hatred among more Afghans.
As the video says, the American "war on terror" is becoming more and more scary.
The war did not bring peace and democracy to the Afghan people, hope for prosperity, but only a devastated country and countless destructions of killing.
The video shows us the truth of America's bloodthirsty killing in the name of "Anti-Terrorism" and the false face of American democracy!
Unwittingly, the following article, from a commercial point of view and from a preservation period, explains why this customer wants a logistics company in the tax area to make cans, although the cans are deep-processed and are not part of the business of a tax logistics company, and the following text may explain why the customer wants to do so.
I'm going to a lot of milk mills, and I'm going to touch a lot of milk line.
In fact, the bags are exactly the same as the powdered milk they're made of. There's no difference.
Then it will certainly be asked: Why is the packing period of one year and the listening period of two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bagging so large?
In fact, a lot of consumers, or mothers, think it's better because the raw materials are different.
In fact, the raw materials are just as expensive as the good ones.
There are also consumers who, after eating it out of this mentality, say that the taste or taste of listening is different!
Now I'm going to tell you why it's expensive. Where is it?
Why are their raw materials so priced at the same price?
Because most manufacturers at the time of pricing take into account the fact that it is difficult for consumers to accept if the price of bags is too high, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturer are very low, or if there is no profit, how can the manufacturer survive?
So they have a huge increase in the price of their listening suits to protect their profit margin.
So most manufacturers push listening instead of bagging.
And if you think so many manufacturers pay tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year for advertising, how can that cost?
You know what I'm thinking.
So, as society develops, marketing costs, such as market promoters, market display costs, product gifts, advertising costs, etc., are also increasing.
So the manufacturers are constantly adding new items, and they're listening, and their prices are constantly rising, in fact, as the market costs increase.
The main purpose is to earn higher profits, but the cost of their raw materials will not exceed $3.4 at most.
And some brands, in order to promote their products, do whatever it takes to link them to hospital doctors who help them promote their products and draw profits ranging from $30 to $80 from one ear to the next.
And the laws of China absolutely do not allow this kind of method of operation, which, in fact, harms consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bags of milk in the jars if you have them at home, which will save costs and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder without any effect on children.
And let's not think that the shelf period is longer than that of the bag, if it's the same as that of the bag after it's opened, just that it's not easy to keep it when it's open and it's prone to tidal changes.
It's too late to deliver food, it's cold, it's dry and hard, it's impossible to eat.
And the soup spilled.

Don't scare people down on the starting line. Xinhuanet.
When you're in the book market, you can always feel the fires of successful books.
Many of the successful books today promote the "best principles" — assuming or implying that you can do it, and then tell you what you need to do."
It's like crossing the "how to do" link that's really the most important and fundamental.
And that's why all these books have a common feature — either to do what's best, or not to do anything at all; 100 or zero; or you go up the mountain, or you just stay there.
This is the best principle, so everyone will admit to being right, but 99% will be scared before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "You have to be determined, you have to be human again, you have to make a 180 degree big shift," which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who follow the rules and refuse to change, you're going to shout "You want to change" in his ear, and it's no doubt self-deception, and it's the way you play the piano.
The vast majority of people will be timid in the face of the word "change" and will not be able to make up their minds; or they will take the first step with a moment's impulse and boldly, but often not for long, not for a moment.
The famous "beginning tomorrow" part of Mr. Marnelli is the most divine expression of this "universal humanity" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, and it often goes beyond the capacity of ordinary people and makes the vast majority of people look forward to it " .
Perhaps the "better principle" is a way of putting more ordinary people on the path of relative success.
The core of the "subordinate principle" is the "lower threshold" — it encourages the theory of a "win-win-win" that if you can't do 100, you can do only one: because one is always greater than zero; if you don't get to Tarzan, you can only get to the little dunes on your doorstep, because it's always better than the way it is.
Anyway, as long as you do something, it's better than not.
As the threshold is significantly reduced, there is a greater likelihood that ordinary people will stick to it, and that the chances of success will increase as long as things stay the course.
It's just a little longer to follow the second best principle.
In short, the "best principle" is, despite its appearance, a symbol of success for all, but it can ultimately inspire, in fact, a minority; and the " second best principle " can be effective in inspiring more people and in benefiting as many as possible.

The nettine reserves of Lake Cyanhai have increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhuanet
Xinning, Xinning, Xiao Fei, Xiao Fei, Xiangxiang, Xinhua Society, was informed by the Qinghai Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results showed that the amount of naked debris in Qinghai Lake was 0.71 million tons more than the previous year, reaching 10.85 million tons this year, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times over the early protection period in 2002.
Cyan Sea Lake, a rare fish species unique to it, has an important role to play in maintaining the safety of the water-fish-bird ecological chain and biodiversity in the Qing Sea Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, as a result of massive man-made killings and the increasing degradation of the environment in naked-coated waters, the number of bare-walled blue-sea lakes fell sharply, with a mere 2,592 tons of naked-sea lakes in 2002.
In 2004, in the Red List of Chinese Species, the naked wall of the Qinghai Lake was listed as a endangered species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the practice of sealing lakefish, prohibiting any group, collective or individual, from fishing for naked carcasses in the main rivers and tributaries of the Qinghai Lake and the lake areas, and prohibiting the sale of naked carcasses and their products.
At the same time, protection efforts continued to be strengthened through the artificial displacement of Qinghai Lake and the clean-up of its main riverine channels, the design of a scientifically sound "fish crossing route" and the annual increase in nettural reserves of Qinghai Lake.
According to Yang Lin, Deputy Director-General of the Agricultural and Rural Department of Qinghai Province, to date, the accumulation of artificial stocking has been implemented for nearly 180 million tails, contributing more than 23 per cent to the restoration of naked resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Qinghai Sanjiang region is an important ecological barrier and water cover for my country and Asia, while Lake Qinghai is a natural barrier and ecological function to control the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiang region and the waters of Qinghai Lake, preserve aquatic wildlife and preserve the biodiversity of the Qingzhou Plateau, the Qinghai has since this year set up a comprehensive catch-free management system through the issuance of a ban on the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the key waters of Qinghai Lake.

Only one bag for me at the restaurant. It's in the bag. It's cold.
Would you like to ask, is the takeout in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
You want to know if it leaked, or if someone took it, thanks.
It's been an hour. It hasn't even arrived yet.
I just saw an article on an official holiday. It's too long.
Give it to the unknown man, Cope.
Most girls suddenly go through their first holiday at the age of 13-15 and close at about 50.
After that, it'll be more regular once a month.
But it's not regular enough to predict it, it's a week or so, it needs to be prepared, and sometimes it's bad luck to roll over.
The length of time, the amount of blood, the degree of pain vary from human to human, some for three days, some for a week; some for less, some for a bloodbath; some for a lack of reaction; some for a pain to an ambulance; some for pain to move away; and others for pain to change over time, before pain does not mean pain for life.
The menstruation is out of control, blood is bleeding 24 hours in a few days until the end, and all we can do is smoke a sanitary towel or a tampons to prevent it from spilling into the clothes chair.
The pain is mainly due to the glandin secretion, and it's no good to eat it before it's too late.
Pre-physiology is too high for uterus and prostatein. It's easy to diarrhea.
If it's about the cycle, the tummy can't be helped, it'll be menstrual in almost two days.
The sanitary towels should be replaced in two or three hours, otherwise they could easily breed bacteria, remove sleep time, worst of all, six times a day, seven days a month, 42 pieces, and if you add pre-prepared copies, there might be 50 pieces, not one per month.
Change the tampons here. We can change them about five or six hours, up to eight hours.
The menstrual hormones can get a little irritated, and the ovation period can be unstable because of the hemorrhoid changes in the body, and it's bad luck that the body tripped itself.
But the official crime rate figures show that women still have a high degree of emotional control and no excuse for emotional problems.
It's not just blood, it's got a deplete uterus.
After the menstruation, the membrane is the thinest and slowly thickest. It is understood that the uterus is the house, that the house is built every month (the membrane is thickened), that the guests are not here, that all of them are removed from the house next month, and that the new house is built over and over again.
The menstruation is inconsequential, and for decades, 24 hours a day a month bleeds, and there is pain in the stomach. Who wants to?
But a man was born because his mother came to the menstruation, to prepare you for the first time in the world to live in a house for 10 months, and to thank your mother for her regular and healthy period of menstruation.
A lot of women's things used to be under pressure, and society brainwashed women about being dirty and ashamed, and people thought that was it, but times changed.
If someone feels sick about menstruation, feels sick about the preparation of a woman's body for life, doesn't have to say it in public, girls stand up and don't think about it, never experience it, never experience it, never know it, and don't be so ungrateful as to look at their mother, how can they want their children?
Finally, girls try the tampon. It's really good.
It's winter and holidays. It's a disappointment to send the wrong ones.
We have to order something else for the kids.
I hope I'm gonna have to check out the product in the shop.
Is there a leak in the foot bath?
The choice of the right tub can be a good health care tool, and today the U.S. and U.S. editor will answer this question in the hope that it will help our friends.
As health awareness increases, the tub is increasingly popular with consumers, and a large number of different products are emerging in the market, giving consumers a lot of room for choice, ranging from a hundred-dollar to a thousand-dollar bath.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared to traditional household electricity, there is a safety risk due to the fact that there is no specialized industry standard for the sale of household electricity in the health-care category, such as a foot bath.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in the water with electricity!"
Mr. Lee told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father to make his birthday present, but he felt numb on the soles of his feet.
Mr. Lee thought it was the vibrating function of the foot bath. I didn't think that the vibration was off. My father still felt numb on the soles of his feet.
Mr. Lee tried with a pen and the pen was lit, and Mr. Lee was surprised to find the water in the tub with electricity.
Then he contacted the merchants, and the merchants took a good attitude, and Mr. Lee was still upset despite the withdrawal of the tub.
Because he found that this long-presumptioned tub now has no clear and detailed industry regulations on the highest temperature, which groups of people, which materials are harmless.
But normally there's no electricity in the tub, but it doesn't rule out that a few products are not strictly shut down when they leave the plant.
So, when you buy it, choose a split tub of foot baths.
Water and electricity are separated. There's no safety risk.
At the same time, you can just take a pen.

So if the food isn't hot, can we cancel it?
I don't want it. He couldn't get it up because he couldn't stop down there.
To go to school is to study, through rational reasoning and logic, questions that cannot be answered directly by perception.
Schooling is the basic philosophy of philosophy and is intended to explain the very nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the name "Standing to School" is taken from the word "Equilibrium" and the word "Metaphysic" is translated by the Japanese people.
The physical branch of schooling includes the intuitive, natural theology and its expansive problems.
The mythology is "to study which terms represent the real existence and which terms represent only a concept."
The nature of schooling means denying the existence of God.
It is based on the belief that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural justification, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
And the method of naturalism means the method of studying the word "God."
Psychiatry is the philosophical branch of the study of consciousness and the nature of their relationship to the body, especially the brain.
The binary theory and the monist theory are the two most important ways of discussing the relationship between the mind and the body.
Knowledge is a philosophical branch that explores the essence, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline for systematic reflection and research on the moral life of humankind; here ethics is defined as all codes of conduct accepted by a group of people or by a culture.
It is divided into meta-ethical (researching the essence of ethical theory or criticism in the abstract) and normative ethics (judgment of different ethical views and advice on ethical norms for correct or wrong behaviour).
It looks at the moral codes of conduct that people should follow, applied ethics (applying ethical theory to academic, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.) and describes ethics (gathering information on how people live, summing up from observed patterns).
It does not look at ethics from preconceived theories, but rather at the real choices made by real moral subjects and observed, which contribute to all the moral elements of this choice, which examine the ethical values held by the community.
The history of ethics includes Roman ethics in Greece, medieval Christian ethics.
Part I: Ethical idea of humanism, represented by Vala and Monda and others.
Part II: Ethical ideas for religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part III: Ethics of politics, represented by Makyavelli et al., modern-day ethics (17-18th century, Empirical Ethicals of British Empiricalism et al., representative figures: Jumud et al., 17-18th century, Ethical Ethics of Eurojustism, representative figures: Spinoza et al., 18th century, Enlightenment Ethics of France, representative figures: Voltaire et al., 18-19th century, German Academy Ethics, representative figures: Kande and Hegel et al., 18-19th century, Ethical Ethics of British Merrillism, representative figures: Ramón and Siquivik et al., 19th century, Ethics of British Ethology of Evolution, representative figures: Spencer and Khonley et al., late 19th century, New Kandry Ethics of Germany, representative figures: Lee Keel and others, late 19th century, Ethics of New Hegelism, representative Thomas Hill Green et al.), transitional ethics (non-rationalistic Ethics, representative of Kerkekeerell, Uncle Bendez and Nitz).
Logical is a subject of study on the principles and standards of effective inference and proof.
Logic usually consists of three parts: condensed reasoning, retroactive reasoning and reasoning, which can be divided into formal and non-formal logic.
Elephant is a subject of study on the nature of beauty and its meaning.

That's the same thing. You need money for a mallet.
You asked the restaurant to bring it up.
I just don't want to go downstairs and buy stuff. That's why I spend so much money on takeout.
Ding Ji-hwan: To friends.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to your friends for their humanitarian assistance over the long time that has elapsed since the death of our loved ones, especially since my appeal for humanitarian assistance in the name of individuals to friends at home and abroad in early 1994 has not been interrupted so far.
The vast majority of the dead now have their old parents thanked, and the orphans have grown into families and jobs.
It's your duty to help our troubled families through the most difficult times.
The new crown epidemic is currently raging around the world, and most donors are retiring.
Therefore, I respectfully request that you suspend the humanitarian donation to the Tiananmen mother group, a humanitarian relief event that should have been a perfect end for us long ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your deeds will be remembered for history.
For a variety of reasons, I can only express my will in this way and ask your friends to understand!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
Tau: Allow me to take this opportunity to present a brief account of 32 years of humanitarian relief by the All-American Association of Self-Government (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MDDF).
In the course of humanitarian relief, AAAF and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations and project implementers often intersect.

It's not always easy to get the bail money into the hands of six or four people.
In 1994, she suggested that "Mother Tiananmen" set up a special team to coordinate and coordinate the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, MDDF established the "Six Four Orphans Education Fund" and in 2009, after all six or four orphans graduated from university, MCDF established the "Six and Four Orphaned Old People's Special Hardship Fund" and has been in operation ever since.
These projects are funded mainly by school and social donations in the six or four years, by generous donations from individuals and by support from the Brothers University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Re-education through Labour Research Foundation.
Until last year, 31 years later, six of them finally received a portion of a donation from Hong Kong that was raised in the name of 64 years.
In the meantime, Human Rights in China is implementing their humanitarian relief projects independently.
We understand that Mr. Ding's call for a six-four donation is for donors to consider, and that we are, indeed, retired old people whose income is not as abundant as before retirement, and would like to thank Mr. Ding for his "friendship" letter.
We will respect their decision to terminate the project within two years and resume it as soon as necessary.
To all those who have been so generous and risking their lives to deliver humanitarian aid, thank and pay tribute to them.

Thanks for the rabbit's comment.
Thanks to Dandan's approval, your satisfaction will keep us in charge. We'll keep working!
This photo studio is really great.
From reception, makeup, costumes, lights, photography to the end.
The make-up man is very delicate, he's going to match your style with your make-up, and he's wearing a big line of makeup.
Don't mention it. It's quite professional.
The studio was very artistic, with two kittens playing with it.
We work in Beijing. A better picture building in Beijing needs to be lined up six months in advance.
I've been looking for this studio, a place where there's soul and attitude.
We have a poor facial profile, and we think it's also a short version of most people, and the photographer, Mr. Liang, will capture it and record a natural moment.
Make-up artist, photographer, late design, a fine team.
Come out and make a scene for us and all the people around us.
My best friend has been recommended to the past, and the girl has just read the negative and is happy as well.
Let's hope this studio is not buried, and more people find it, and it's their style, not their style.
Thank you very much for the Eagle, for Ling's five-star assessment, both very thought and creative newcomers, and we're creative studios, as long as the customer likes us to do it with two hundred percent of our time, and we're grateful to meet each other.
The sweet assistant, the lively photographer teacher, everyone on the team was super nice, wonderfully filmed, hard to forget, and it was much more effective than I thought.
Thank you, Xiaoyu, for your comments and for knowing you as well, from Hu and Holt to the island of Qin, trusting us thousands of miles away, I'm happy to know you and to have a chance to play on the island of Qin next time.
How do I pay?
The food has arrived.
No riders to receive.
Now the restaurant clerk calls me.
A program that wants to share a personal experience.
If you want to enter the industry, you can choose a place to train, but if you don't think about it, it's better to learn on your own, after all, it costs a lot of money and takes six months to learn.
But training is really a very good option if it is intended to enter the industry, especially for those who are self-sufficient and weak.
You can learn yourself if you're more self-sufficient, but you're tired.
Of course it's very important to choose a good training institution.
It depends first and foremost on the teaching staff of this institution, which has little meaning if it is not strong enough, and of course some of the new training institutions are not very strong.
Second, if you look at this institution before you choose, you'd better look at the students who come out of this institution, after all, only the students at this institution know what it is, and the lessons are good or bad.
Well, I don't know how to answer that question, because you don't have a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning about it is very relevant to your own situation.
Professionals, ages, languages that want to learn, even in a city, have to do with what you study or want to do.
If you're a student and you haven't graduated yet, or if you're a computer major, then if you have enough time to suggest self-study, this is the least efficient and cost-effective, and many of the training institutions on the bottom line are actually very good, but one study is expensive, two is more time spent, and basic needs are concentrated on training for three to six months.
But if that's what I'm saying, self-learning is easy, and many of the learning resources on the Internet are now free, or there's plenty of training resources at station b. If you don't find resources, you can also contact me through profiles, get free resources, or consult in detail.
There are also more classic books that can be combined with videos.
If you're not a computer professional, but you can also pay a certain amount of money and time for learning, then it's recommended that you go to a training institution so that it doesn't have to be hard, the teacher speaks in detail, there's specific answers to questions, and there's assistance in learning planning or supervision.
And now a lot of training institutions sign employment agreements, have in-house placements and recommend them to the company after study, so that the job-seeking interview sessions can save a lot of things.
That's what I'm saying, because I don't know about you, it's not very detailed. If you have anything else to consult, you can contact me at any time.
I said, "It's 1:00. I saw it all at Apple."
What do you mean?
I'm not done yet. What are you doing?
myself, carrying various types of (installation, cleaning, maintenance) water heaters, water purification units, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, fuel smokers, lighting, glass cleaning, professional seams, domestic service
Thanks to those who gave me a little credit for trying hard for my life, it's hard to live, but it's going on.
Life doesn't fail every man who works hard, and if you like, you pay attention to me.
That's how life is, people look at results, they stand alone, and we face life, and we have no other choice but to stay strong, to look back, but not to go back...
Cleanliness is work and duty, life is beautiful by service, service is good by heart.
Cleaning up is the dirtyest thing we do, but we'll clean every corner of the client's house with the most seriousness, and we'll see the satisfaction of the customer with the smile and the erected thumbs, and all the weight will be paid in return!
My day-to-day work.
- Your request, my service.
Use your heart, clean your heart, keep your beauty.
You're concerned about the details that Fung Gui's domestic help has done for you. I can do what I can to serve my lover.
It's clean, it's homemade, it's served, it's clean.
Indoor and outdoors, my daily work.
Crystal lamps are gorgeous, but they fade away for long periods of time, and only after they've been cleaned can they shine, and so is life.
If you do it with your heart, you'll succeed, you'll shape it carefully and we'll be serious.
Give me a chance to make you happy. Quality tells you everything, because the profession is trustworthy. Your approval is my encouragement!
It's hard to do everything right now!
But I've always believed that if I was serious enough to insist on it, I'd be better than others, at least more than sitting there complaining."
The idea of a day is morning, and all the good things start early in the morning, and I hope you'll be happy, lucky, healthy, as you wish, and start a new day, and stay in a good mood all day.
When I was a child, happiness was a thing, and happiness was a goal; when I grew up, happiness was a goal and happiness was achieved; when I matured, happiness was a mental condition, and when I realized it was happiness.
Be the truest and kindest of yourself, walk by heart, live without regret; live by one path, walk by one path; live by two treasures: good health, good mood, beautiful to old age!
At every stage of life, there are different kinds of problems.
Many times, it's not the power that binds you, it's the courage to face it.
If you can't hide, you'd better face it.
The more you're afraid, the harder you're gonna get, the harder you're gonna get, the harder you're gonna get.
The Chinese Shatsu exhibiter joined forces to organize the first Saudi biennial exhibition of contemporary art - Xinhuanet
Xinhua Society, Riyadh, 12 December, Saudi Arabia's first two-year exhibition of contemporary art — the Diriye two-year exhibition of contemporary art — was officially opened to the public in the Diriya JAX Art Zone, north-west of Riyadh, Saudi capital, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, etc.
The two-year exhibition was co-organized by the Saudi Diriya Biannual Exhibition Foundation and the UCCA Yurens Contemporary Art Centre in China, where the Director General of the Arts of the UCCA Yurens Contemporary Art Centre in China, Jiuyu Tian, served as Director General of the Arts.
According to the advocacy team, the theme of the two-year exhibition, " Touching the Stones Through the River " , is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of socio-economic transition, which also reflects the current context of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
This bi-annual exhibition, which covers nearly 12,000 square metres, spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: " Touching stones across the river " , " Passage as an experiment " , " Marginal reflection " , " Walking to the public " , " Beautiful New World " , and " The Spirit of Art " .
Of these, 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40 per cent of the total number of exhibits, including paintings, installation of arts and performing arts in various forms; 12 Chinese artists were also of great interest, some of them using recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Ice ' s Reconstructing of a classic mountain painting with waste in " An endless map of the story series behind " (2014).
The Chief Executive Officer of the Diriye Bienen Festival Foundation, Buckley, expressed the hope that the current two-year exhibition would create an international dialogue that would give a global audience an opportunity to learn about the flourishing cultural industries and creative communities in Saudi Arabia and enhance interaction.
" The objective of the biennial exhibition is twofold, allowing Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and Saudi viewers to integrate into the contemporary art world ... "
It is understood that a series of lectures, artists, advocates and opinion leaders in the creative industry will be held during the bi-annual curtain week to discuss the themes of intercultural communication, contemporary artistic development, etc.

Yunnan: Integrated regulation of rural public service job management - Xinhuanet
On December 12, Xinhua Society Kunming (Reporter Lim Bing) launched a policy to promote rural renewal of rural public service jobs in Yunnan Province to help promote rural revitalization in a comprehensive manner in order to sustain employment support for the poor and consolidate the gains made in the fight against poverty.
The relevant head of the Yunnan Department of People ' s Social Affairs reported that at present, 448,300 rural public service jobs are being developed in Yunnan for employment of rural disadvantaged groups, such as the labour force, and that they play an important role in helping people out of poverty to achieve employment gains, consolidate gains from poverty eradication and effectively improve the capacity of rural public services.
The new regulations, issued jointly by the Yunnan People ' s Association, Rural Renewal, Finance and others, regulate the scope of recruitment of rural public service workers at the grass-roots level, the management of funds, job development, job management, etc.
With regard to job development, the new regulations specify that the placement is based on the principle of "as required, to be staffed, to be managed, to be managed dynamically, to be controlled by volume " who to develop, to be used, to be responsible for "one person on a one-time basis, to be published voluntarily, to be managed in an integrated manner " .
Recruitment procedures must be carried out in accordance with such steps as public announcements, declarations, audits, publicity, recruitment, pre-service training and induction.
In addition, the new regulations specify the specific responsibilities of the main rural public service sector for the development of jobs of public interest, the criteria for subsidizing rural public service jobs and the means for subsidizing them. They stipulate that the rural public service sector shall purchase commercial insurance for accidents and injuries for persons placed in rural public service jobs; they require the relevant authorities to monitor the granting of subsidies for rural public service jobs on a regular basis.
Wrong address.
Hello.
Can you cancel the order?
I'll reschedule.
Has it been cancelled?
Two, although the right has a history of ambition, it's not long, so it's just a little sunny, a little water, a little sweaty, a little bit of hope, and a bit of a blow to the hair.
But as a matter of fact, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive role of the right should not be denied from the definition of truth in the end of the revolution, the development of the economy to improve science and technology and the promotion of administrative institutionalization and human rights guarantees.
Thirdly, as far as I'm concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Wei Dong's claims, I care about him and respect him; because he's serious, he's serious about China and he's serious about China's social problems.
But I object to his anti-communist theory, and I think that counter-revolution is necessary, and revolution is bound to lead to social unrest, loss of life, and political groups are mixed up and foreign countries take advantage of it.
iv. Change or improve China's patience and accountability to its people, and the political speculators, not the right, the asshole.
Let's talk about left.
Left, it's a bunch of times and politics.
If the right has a positive impact on society and the Communist Party listens to the right and analyzes their thoughts when needed, then the left does not, because the left wants what the Communists throw away!
Five, I don't think it's necessary to see some of my friends squeezing their left side.
Don't try to be reasonable with a traitor or a left maniac.
And don't try to prove that we're right, let alone try to get the traitors and the left fools to admit it. Why?
Thus We told our friends that when the traitor scolded you with 50 cents, and when the left scolded your right dog, it was the right way in the middle.
Many young people have dreams when they're old, forget about them or pursue them, but become paranoid.
It's a long way away from the ideal, even the dragon-slayered youth.
On the other hand, I think it's generally about restraint and freedom, and China's genes from history and culture lead to China as a whole being left.
And the national right is free, focused on efficiency and development, and the left is more regulated, more on fairness and security.
The general desire of society is to be more equitable, while the Chinese and the United States compete, the left is certain and is expected to last for many years.
I can't read it. It's over.
Nothing. That's what flowers are for.
In the last two years, the embargo and siege imposed by the Emperor on China as a chip has not only left China in an unprecedented state of distress, but has also caused huge losses to the United States.
The direct consequence of the US Emperor ' s pressure on China ' s chip industry and its demand that its own enterprises and allied companies block the chip industry at the same time is the impact on the orders and profits of global chip suppliers, resulting in lower R & D inputs and lower production capacity for chip producers, thereby creating a global disruption in the supply chain shortage of chips.
The missing core has now reached major industries around the world, such as the shutdown of cars, increased prices for mobile phones and almost all of the industries that use chips.
In order to take ownership of the chip, a growing number of national technology giants are beginning to move towards the path of "beautiful."
In order to assert control over the global semiconductor, to hold back the development of the Chinese semiconductor industry and, more recently, to host the Chip Summit, the old American and American movements have become frequent; and to invite the 64-nation giants to form a semiconductor coalition and to draw funds to support the indigenous technology giants of the United States, such as Intel, the old tech giant of the United States, who has invested $20 billion in the construction of two crystal mills in Arizona, the United States, and to open the chip to the outside.
When most people think that this intel move will have a certain impact on the power build, it's possible to take the power out of the job.
The reason for this is that Intel, as the oldest technology giant in the United States, has been working for decades in the semiconductor field, with a large pool of talent and technical reserves, must rise quickly in the short term to defeat the power build.
However, on Intel's decision, the founder of the power plant, Zhang, was not content with his loyalty.
At the Master 2021 Think Tank Forum in April of this year, Zhang's charade was amazing, and he has nothing to fear about Intel's efforts to build a crystal factory: Intel's chip-generation factory, quite ironic.
Zhang's devotion to Intel's march into the realm of crystallization is due to the fact that Zhang's loyalty to the power build and to Intel's bitterness more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was a bead in the manufacturing industry of the United States Empire, with a global peak and a world semiconductor.
By the 1980s, the world's semiconductor high-end chips had been held by a few powerful men.
The semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chips were designed, manufactured and sealed by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this pattern overstretched some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs faced huge production-line construction costs.
In the 1980s, a division of labour began to emerge in the chip industry, prompted by market demand, and in 1984 Zhang, when he heard of a company specializing in chip designs, thought that a factory dedicated to crystal round manufacturing could be set up.
Soon after, Zhang's idea of loyalty became a reality, and the power supply came from the station.
The power plant targets the main camp business at the single link of "crystal processing", without design, and only provides proxy services for crystal-crystal manufacturing.
The power plant that was created at the time, in front of Intel's giant.
In order to gain capital support, Jang was investing in Intel, but when Intel heard that power was being used only as a manufacturing link in the chip industry, it became clear that some of them were too self-serving to be able to look down on electricity and refuse to invest in electricity.
Jang's loyal plan also concluded that Intel was underestimating the crystal-crystal process.
I didn't expect to see the giants in the crystal manufacturing service, but now they're going to start working in the crystals.
So, Jang's loyalists think it's ironic that Intel has entered the crystal round.
Today, the market value of electricity has exceeded that of Intel.
It's natural that Intel won't be able to stand up in the face of power build-up.
Today, electricity has been pumped towards the 3nm chip, while Intel is still in the 14nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
Not anymore.
At 19:06, we've been down for two hours.
Let's see some of this.
What's normal love?
The random selection of three heat searches: February, when the second dragon heads up, the price increases for the best friend, the salad events, the spread of the migraine peaks, and then [indicative drops] (sliding curves) eventually dissipate, and if secondary migraines are created, small humps will reappear.
They appear to be the same as the web-based network of officials.
What's an abnormal mirage?
The random selection of six hot searches in the same incident, showing [insolvency], [sawing], [breaking cliff].
[insolvency] is artificial heating, rapid heat-seeking and public concern; [sawing] is periodic heating to ensure that the subject is kept on the list; [disconnecting from the cliff] is collective evacuation, and the heat search is performed as a function of a new mission to the new battlefield.
In figure 9, one event's hot peak is just another event's valley, with no time difference, and must be a single batch of watermen on board to launch a new offensive.
The professionalization of black relations is evident: dozens of hot searches are on the list, which attracts attention, which are responsible for Coptics, which are responsible for war dynamics, which are diverted, which are perceived for influences, which are misleading, which incite emotions, which are blackmailed, which is the black market, which is divided into batches, and which are fine-tuned to combat, taking into account almost all the elements of the spread of the contagion.
It's a science, it's a science, it's a position, it's all subjective, it's just from objective data, it's a black PR.
We'll dig it out together. We'll dig it out.

For the first time in countries such as Mauritius, Omikazine was found infected - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 12th, Xinhua Consolidated News Reporter outside: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi reported for the first time in recent days the infection of the Omikium virus.
Mauritius first reported two cases of Omikium infection in the country on 10th.
According to Minister of Health Ma Kalesh Jagutepar, one of the infected persons was a tourist who had arrived in Mauritius on 27 November from South Africa; the other was a local resident of Mauritius who had been positive on 30 November after contacting a person who had recently returned to South Africa.
After hospital isolation, the results of the nucleic acid tests were turned negative and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
On 10th, the Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced that it had first diagnosed three cases of Omicazine infection.
All three were students who came back from abroad early this month and were not admitted to hospital due to mild illness.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicium strain, the Seymour government has been increasing its efforts to prevent the spread of the virus.
From 6 December to 10 January next year, passengers over the age of 12 arriving by air are required to be tested for nucleic acid at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health of Serbia also announced on 10th that it would begin vaccination of the country ' s children between 5 and 11 years of age against the new crown vaccine.
The Minister of Health of Malawi, Kunbizé Chiponda, said on 9th that for the first time, three cases of Omikium infection had been detected in the country.
The country ' s health sector sequenced 12 new coronary positive samples from 9 November to 2 December, and found three cases of infection.

At first, my friends introduced me to trust, so they chose to look at my initial budget at $70,000 for a basic renovation.
When you come to the store, you start a series of tricks.
The first time I came to the store was to show them my family chart, they didn't actually check the house, they could offer me a price of $70,000 for my 135 house, and they probably showed me their material and they didn't know what brand they were.
Their second trick is that you'll drag you to the store to pay the deposit.
When I hesitate to pay the down payment, they invite their so-called manager to tell you how much we can give you if you pay the down payment today.
This is a big hole, and I'm an example of living and being deceived by a ten grand down payment in a mind impulse.
He offered me a lot of questions for $70,000, not electricity and water, not any doors and cabinets, bathrooms, and those three are the big costs of the building.
They charge more for their services than any other company.
I lost faith in this company, and I signed the contract without saying anything at first.
When I went to them to pay back, they showed up with experience. They had a special team to deal with you.
It's a client's problem, no matter what. They don't have a duty.
There's a lot of details about the evasiveness, the tears, and not the choice, because my friends are looking for their renovated houses and they're in bad quality, and they'll give you a lot of money later.
Dad, they're the deluded Dragon Head Decoration, now they're pretty, like they're shut down and changed to something else.
So let's not go to Dad's renovation company like this.

Okay, well, don't cancel this conversation, but if you don't pay me back for 5 to 10 days, you'll do it.
I asked if you could cancel it in less than 15 minutes.

There's about a pair of meteor showers in the sky.
Xinhua Society expert Tianjin Tianjin on December 12, as the last mass meteor shower of the year, the twin meteor showers of one of the three meteors in the northern hemisphere will rise dramatically on December 14 and friends who like meteor showers will be able to observe in the middle of the night after that.
Beijing astronomers have been shooting a twin meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the parent bodies of meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent objects of twin meteor showers are the same as the 3,200 asteroid, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The twin meteor shower is also the second meteor shower known not to be born by a comet.
Astronomy Board Director, Astronomy Cops Specialist, said that, as in the case of Huge Age, the twin meteor showers usually occur at the end of the year, and the "surveillance period" can last from December 4 to December 17.
The meteor shower is known for its high volume and stability, and along with the miraculous meteor shower, the Anglo-Countine meteor shower is known as the three main meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A notable feature of the bipolar meteor shower is the slowness of meteoroids and their colours, as well as the abundance of fire meteors, which are suitable for visual and astronomical photography by starters.
Tianjin City astronomer Yang Xian was shot in Tianjin County on December 13, 2020 by a twin star shower.
Astronomer predictions indicate that this year's twin meteor showers will hit at around 1500 hours on December 14, when ZHR (the number of meteors per hour when radiation points are at the top of the head under ideal conditions) is 150.
Recommended index chart of twin meteor showers.
"Last year, the `deepness' of the bipolar meteor shower was impressive, but this year's bipolar meteor shower will be disturbed by the moonlight, and the beauty will be reduced a little bit.
The 14th is November 11th, and the moon is full of moons, and the bright moon will interfere with observations, so that the moon will fall in the middle of the night, and the radiation point of the twin meteor shower will rise.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe these hours after midnight, but be careful to keep warm ... "
How can as many meteors as possible be observed?
"Don't recommend observation in cities, you can choose a high altitude in the suburbs or in the countryside, light down, view the northeast open, and then patiently wait until the moon is down.
It's important to note that the bipolar meteor showers flow in all directions without looking at the radiation points of the bipolar meteor shower.
For friends who like photography to make a beautiful " meteor shower " , it's best to choose a wide angle, a large halo camera, using high ISO and the largest halo.
For reasons of stability and continuity, tripods, back-up batteries and fast doors are also essential ... " .
He said, "I'm sorry.

As I understand it, traditional televisions are meant to refer to LCDs, while the differences in the location of LCDs and LCDs in the market are mainly as follows:
First, laser TV is more focused on the big screen market.
Laser TV is clearly more focused on the big screen market than LCD's full market positioning, or laser TV itself is the product of the big screen.
At present, mainstream LCD televisions are mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while laser televisions are generally 75 inches or more, with a maximum of over 100 inches, fully meeting user demand for large screens and power.
In recent years, the share of global sales and sales of laser television has been increasing, accounting for over 60% of total television sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Mid-Ekang's projections, the market for laser television will grow by more than 140 per cent in 2020 and will continue to grow at a high rate.
The success in the big screen market is largely due to the excellent eye-guarding performance of laser television.
On the basis of the imaging principles of laser television reflectivity, the light from laser sources does not go straight into the eye, and the imaging process is closer to the image of the object under natural conditions and less stimulating to the eye than the back light from LCD.
The Xersi Laboratory of the Chinese Institute for Standardization of Electronic Technology and the ophthalmology specialists of the Beijing Association and the hospital produced 144 test data by viewing the rigorous comparison of laser and LCD television under the same conditions as the population.
The data confirm that laser television does have a strong eye-protective feature and even a certain improvement in certain aspects.
In a time of increasing attention to visual health, laser television not only attracts a growing number of users with eye protection advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the colored electricity market.
Second, laser television focuses more on high-end markets.
Contrary to the constant downward trend in LCD prices, most of the current market prices for laser television are above $10,000, and as sizes and light sources rise, prices rise.
Why would a laser TV be so expensive?
That must make sense.
With the constant development of light sources and technology, laser television has many advantages that LCD TV and projection cannot achieve.
With ultra-focal-range projection technology, laser televisions are projected at shorter distances than traditional projectors, capable of a 100-inch large screen experience at short distances, requiring little space, and the mainframe is small, occupying little space.
In brightness, big brand laser TV can reach more than 2,000.
Plus, the heat is lower, the equipment is less worn out and the television has a longer useful life.
In addition to this, many high-end laser television models carry really 4K super-high-skinned, artificial intelligence systems, imitation screens and many cutting-edge technologies that can give users a more powerful audio-visual experience.
It's not a false demand, it's a product of demand, it's a qualitative and input output ratio, it's not a sound player's food, it's a big screen and an inadequate viewing environment, it can be tried, it's good or bad, it's good or bad, it's good to be judged, it's easy to listen to one side of the story.
Simply put, the hyperbolic near-focal projector, laser television, in order to get close to the screen, had to use expensive hyperbolic lenses and mirrors, which did not fit the best optical design.
For the purpose of shielding part of the environmental light, the microstructured Fénères is expensive, and the 80 inch price is basically a 65-inch LCD.
Also, I particularly hate that projectors use a punctuated reflection for their eyes. Please, the light on the curtain that can be seen in the eyes is direct in the eyes, you reflect on the ceiling, you can't see it, you can't see it in the eyes.
And, if the projective wasn't reflective, it wouldn't be like that.
It's just that the heat effect of high-growth curtains is ignored, and it's hard to see a large amount of light from one angle.
There's no branch yet.
With a micro-letter appointment date, my little sister sends me a choice of timing, and the answer is more timely.
Before I went to see the pictures at the store, more of them in the outdoor dress, they were beautiful, and they were a lot of styles.
After that day, I had a brief exchange of ideas with my sister, and I was very patient in trying out two of my tangled styles, and finally I was able to make up some props before the photographer started filming, which would guide the movement and be more refined in detail.
But maybe it wasn't my style, because I didn't know what to do with it, but it's supposed to be a good look.
The photographer will help with the photo selection, communicate with the late style and feel very sensitive.
It's gonna take about six months to fix it. Sit down and wait.
The second one was a real-life king's meal. Most of the clothes in the show were filmed.
Finally, a black dress was chosen and different styles were experienced.
It takes about two hours, makeup plus, and the cameraman's younger brother is 95, and he's a little bit green, hoping to get more advice from the customer about the action.
Good Quality at the Visual Fine Arts Museum.
It's on the front page. Let's see Queenie too.
You fill out the phone number and pick out the dress, you can choose the dress, you've been patient, you've had three or four costumes, you've been making up for a long time, you've been in the service, and then you're gonna learn how to look, you're gonna have a big face, you're gonna have to do it for half a month, three or four days, and it's like it's not the same as the original.
[Environment] It's okay as a whole.
There's a lot of clothes to choose.
There's almost three make-up positions in the studio.
[Service] Very passionate and very thoughtful.
The stylist's patient.
The photographer will teach you how to act.
If you're not satisfied, the photographer will come forward with the recoup.
[Experience] Maybe it's a bit too much. It's a three-eye skin.
The browtails are shaved. It's a little awkward not to draw the brows.
The picture was given in 10 days, but the P-chart didn't work very well, and it felt like it was still obvious.
Because I don't know what style it is, I tried two sets, and I picked them out, or a black dress.
The hairdresser and the make-up sister were so patient to help me get it out.
I started taking pictures after making up my makeup.
After the shoot, four of my favorites were chosen as a pedagogue, and the younger brother said that the film was in 15 minutes and the ending was very satisfying.
It's been 3 days since I didn't respond... because your system couldn't identify my credit card, so I couldn't join the #PRS_ORG#plus monthly fee program!
The strangest thing is, I use the same credit card every time I pay.
I'm paying for the freight every time.
You can grant me an exemption and charge me my monthly fee until you've finished your investigation.
A little umbrella for insurance. What's the point?
Umbrella is an Internet insurance broker platform.
In terms of conditionality: According to the "Regulation of Insurance Brokering Agencies (Revised 2015) Regulations", three key words must be met to become an insurance brokerage company: shareholders, sponsors have not recorded any major violations in the last three years and the minimum limit is 50 million yuan in order to be established, subject to the agreement of the China Insurance Council.
These three are really tough, and they're all about strength, approval by the State authority of the Silver Insurance Supervisory Board (supervising insurance companies throughout the country, banks), good behaviour on the part of shareholders, small umbrella insurance for insurance brokers, and not too many questions about the formality of umbrella insurance, after all, these three thresholds that no insurance company can meet.
At this point, it's not bad. It's trustworthy.
In terms of insurance products: umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, where many companies are selling their star serious illness insurance, such as the latest one on board and the super-Mary 5, the claimant and the insurer are Thai life, and umbrella insurance is just a third-party broker, without questioning its spectrification.
In terms of contribution model: Internet platform products, which are less expensive to run a business point and more expensive to pay a worker ' s salary, have a relatively high universal value and are paid in a flexible manner that supports monthly payments and reduces the pressure on insured persons ' contributions while maximizing the leverage to squeez insurance.
That's still very good.
You can think about it.
This is particularly important from the professional point of view of the operator, since insurance is a highly specialized industry in which many customers of Internet products can insure themselves, and there are many errors in health notification and employment, where non-insured workers tend to add their own subjective sense of health or compatibility to the insurance policy, so that there is a risk that there will be a lot of compensation and that there will be a risk of rejection.
I've been in insurance phone sales myself in Tetsu Weibo, just like Umbrella, and I'm an Internet insurance broker, and I'm very responsible to tell you.
Internet insurance is real and reliable. It's not human. There's no professional Internet access, and there's a lot of misinformation about sales.
For example: $6 million for insurance, $6 million for insurance delivery, $60,000 for free of charge. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they don't tell the insured that the first month, the next month is a normal charge, dozens to 200, and it's not clear what many customers buy for a year or two.
Thought it'd cost a dollar and the insurance company $6 million.
Free delivery of cell phones is done by the end of the policy, like 6666,88888, and if a winning text message is sent, it doesn't change itself or be reminded.
For the insured, it's a free 60,000, short-term, if it's on this one, without other commercial insurance, if it's serious, if it's gonna work out, if it's gonna work, if it's gonna work out, it's not gonna work, and then it's gonna start running naked.
The State is also cracking down on the current misdirection of Internet insurance sales.
So on balance, there's no problem with the platform, there's no problem with the product, there's no problem with the professionalism and professional conduct of the operator.
It was suggested that the subject matter should be considered in a comprehensive manner. In fact, many offline insurance brokers had a wider product, more opportunities and more products available to customers, and some products had a better value for money than Internet products.
I've helped 59 Internet clients on my own, insured under the line, with a premium of 2000-3000 a year.
If you have any questions, you are welcome to communicate and communicate with me.
I: Minya Insurance broker, who has three years of experience in business management training, has served nearly 1,000 business users and has worked with over 100 insurance companies. Before I become insured, I will customize insurance products for customers from the point of view of their needs. In insurance, I will try to get the best nuclear results for customers. After I have, I will prepare the insurance policy for customers, hold the policy, and make the client feel safe.
Growing up with every client for life.
I hope my answer will help the subject!
As defined by the Insurance Regulatory Authority, Internet insurance is an insurance operation in which the insured person can independently complete all insurance processes by clicking on the insurance link.
During this process, the insured person does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign, and all steps can be carried out by the insured person.
Although Internet insurance coverage is not so ceremonial, and may not even exist in hard copy paper contracts, it does not in any way affect the validity or legal validity of electronic contracts.
It's kind of like a "telephone sales" run, but there's also a fatal problem with insurance, which is that the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract for decades, and should we seriously consider whether the "inter", which we choose, is an "insurer" who can be with us for a long time and who will provide us with services for many years?
So how do I get in touch with the delivery officer?
It's almost 3:00.
Is that for me, communication?
I said I'd knock and deliver.

It'll be fine if you get the benefit code back.
No problem. No need to arrange a re-delivery. I've bought another one. I don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
I've been opposed to any form of slander and verbal abuse from the past to the present, and I cannot accept such physical assault.
In civil society, we can embrace everything, but we're going to put an end to this kind of scoundrel.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it's this uncivilistic way to resist first.
I've been indifferent since you started sending Facebooks and friends' requests, and then you've been posting tactile posts, and then you've been trying to post my place and father's name on social media.
You're not just going to have to eat six meals a day, you're going to keep me up, you're going to talk to your so-called friends on Facebook about me, about my covert, humiliating speech, appearance, body, healthy, bed-breeding strawberries, whatever, and I'm going to forget it.
How do you know I got a lot of comments from a lot of friends about your Facebook friend's account with a picture of you and a sexual harassment component?
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
When I uploaded the news to the police, you didn't stop at all, and you became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, and whatever your status is, in our society, it requires respect from both sexes.
Yes, you can go on with this tactful, subtle, humiliating, insulting speech, and you can go on saying that you're just caring and caring for me, and you can continue to think that it's not harassment, and you can even continue denying that it's not your idea or making all kinds of offensive statements.
Yes, I can't, and I can't stop you.
I don't know you. I don't want to know you. I don't need your opinion.
I don't even think there's a girl who's willing to let someone else humiliate herself in exchange for fame.
Friends ask me, are you okay?
I said yes, you wouldn't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay when she's so bullied.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who don't have basic virtues will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe in justice.
I intercepted some of the messages for everyone to comment on.
No one can pretend to be you with your own post.
All I can say is that you're an enemy of civilization.
I'll smile.
Viet Nam People ' s News Network - Prime Minister Fan Ming of the Government of Viet Nam is attending the Third National Forum on Digital Technology Enterprise Development in Viet Nam
Two major meetings were held during the Third National Forum on Digital Technology Enterprise Development in Viet Nam, focusing on the themes of digital enterprise and the digital transformation of the country, digital technology enterprises and the economic recovery and development of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
According to the Minister of Communications and Media, Nguyen Monxun, in 2021 the number and operating income of Viet Nam ' s digital technology enterprises continued to grow to nearly 10 per cent, despite the spread of the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
In 2021, Viet Nam cultivated a typical number of digital products, focusing on the major challenges facing Viet Nam, many digital products have moved out of the country and Viet Nam has been ranked higher in digital technology.
Minister Nguyen Monhung called on digital technology enterprises to take responsibility for the development of national digital transition platforms, which are mandated to serve as national missions.
At the Forum, heads of departments and State agencies are studying, developing, applying, transferring digital technology to enterprises, organizations and individuals that have shared social resources for the development of Vietnamese technology enterprises, working together to promote national digital transformation, economic recovery in the aftermath of the Chubei epidemic and other breakthrough ideas and solutions.
In his address to the Forum, Prime Minister Fan Ming-zheng stressed that digital transformation is the path to the world and an objective need for development.

Prime Minister Fan Ming stressed that the digital transformation needs to reflect the national spirit, be based on internal strength, strategy, long-term and decisive factors, and that external power is important and a breakthrough.
At the same time, he argued that the digital transition needed to be driven by deep and sustainable development, participation in the prevention and control of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, economic recovery and development, responding to subsequent changes, overcoming the depletion of natural resources, contributing to a green transition and developing green energy.
Digital transformation requires participation in the creation of databases for the protection and promotion of the cultural values of the countries concerned, historical traditions, national landscapes, etc., and the promotion of digital transformation in banking, taxation, land management and development of databases, and logistics.
The greatest goal of the digital transition is to make people happier and the country more prosperous.

During the Forum, Prime Minister Fan Ming-zheng attended the 2021 award ceremony for "Viet Nam made" excellent digital products and the opening of the "Viet Nam made" digital product exhibition.
I've reported it, I've attached it, but I haven't replied.
What cow? No bull.
It's saliva chicken, raw meat.
I can't eat it.
You make sure it's fresh food, not old food?
unacceptable
I've already paid the bill.

Why did you recreate it?
That's ridiculous.

Hello.
I just placed an order showing that the rider was waiting at the restaurant, but the restaurant said the order was ready and there was no sign of the rider.
Can I help you follow it up, because it's a little more urgent. Thank you.
It could be half an hour late for no reason.
Did you actually solve the problem?
Which one of you would it be good for the editor to bring you eight lilies?

Takatami's house.

There's a lot of home calls, lots of brands, lots of brands.
Two-twelfs, to the Hanston water cleaners, looking at the water cleaners, they're doing a lot of work in the stores, and they're cheaper.
The house is 11 floors, negative 2 to 9 floors, negative 2 are parking places and parking is free during the day!
It's really bad around here. There's only a few hardware stores in the hotel, and the restaurant smells like it.
This elevator is silent, like the big disease, negatives two to negative one. It's not going back and forth. It's going down from the safe passage to the first floor. It's going straight to a furniture store. The furniture store is closed. The safe passage is not going anywhere!
The house still needs to be upgraded. There's a lot of places that haven't been developed.
Address: 555 north of the Shaybak district, easy traffic, large parking lot, free during the day.
Environment: To be honest, the store is large, with 8-9 floors, furniture, household appliances, and all kinds of small things I can buy... so many branders are in the shop, Muss, Ops, Wardy, the boss, the peak house, Hanston, Jacques, Friends, Sieve, Richty, Mandarin, Nature, United, America, Yadan... and so many brands I can only remember, it's a good place to buy products, and I'm tired of sitting on the couch.
I've been trying to buy a nice set of sofas, and my friends say there's a lot of sofas to pick, and they've been looking at home, and they're all right, and it's just that it's a little expensive, so they're still in the middle of it.

All coverage of Xinhua Network for the implementation of green integrated services on water in the Ganges Dry Flows
The Xinhua Society Wuhan (Reporter Wang Xian) launched its second fully operational water green integrated service area in Chongqing City on December 11, as scheduled, following the launch of the Xuan State green integrated water service area in Sichuan Province on December 8.
So, the water-green integrated service area covers the Yangtze, medium, downstream.
The Deputy Director-General of the Ministry of Transport, Jiang Jianhua, said that previously, the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and others had moved between the Yangtze River and built 10 integrated water-based green service areas downstream, which had been endorsed by a wide range of crews and played an important role in promoting quality development in the Yangtze shipping.
The full coverage of the water-based green integrated service area is another milestone in the construction of green shipping in the Yangtze River, where pollution from the Yangtze ship has been received and the capacity of the shipping service has been significantly enhanced.
The Water Green Integrated Service Area was described as an important facility to provide full range of production and life services to ships and crews and to help them solve the problem of distress and distress.
The construction of two functioning water-based integrated service areas in the upper Yangtze, which combines life services, production services and government services, with the theme of greening the environment, with the emphasis on ship repair and emergency rescue services for ships, and the realization of "one anchorage, multiple services " for ships in ports, will make it easier and more efficient for crew members who sail in the Yangtze for many years.
The three American carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visit Guam, 2022-01-17 Dowy, pro-CCP media multidimensional coverage: the latest news on Chinese-American relations: the latest satellite images show that three American carriers are gathering around China; the American media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the United States Navy arsenal rarely visits Guam, releasing important signals to American allies and opponents in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to China's think tank, the South China Sea Strategic Posture Awareness Platform, on 9 January, a satellite discovered the American carrier, USS Carl Vincent, near the Balabak Channel.
The Barabbath Channel, which connects the South Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic location in the chain of the First Island of the Western Pacific.
The platform anticipates that the Carl Vincent will be deployed to the South Sea.
This is the first time the carrier of the Carl Vincent has been deployed on board F-35C fighter planes and CMV-22 fishhawk transports.
The American carrier now in the upper Pacific Ocean, in addition to the Carl Vincent, and the USS Abraham Lincoln, who left the United States on January 3rd.
Lincoln was also on board for the first time with the F-35C squadron of the 314th United States Marines.
In addition to the two above-mentioned carriers, the United States Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan carrier, based in Yokohama, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the Shamplan Lake missile cruiser, the Stokdar missile destroyer, etc.
On January 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Posture Awareness Platform released the latest satellite images showing that three American carriers were gathering around China.
U.S. three carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China to rarely visit Guam on January 17, 2022, U.S. naval carrier CMV-22B flight route.
Also reported on January 17 by CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam last weekend.
The Ohio class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, with 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the United States Navy base on Guam last Saturday, January 15.
American carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visit Guam, which, according to analysis, sends a signal to their allies and enemies in an increasingly tense situation in the India-Pacific region.
This is the first time that a United States ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016 and the second time that a United States ballistic missile submarine has made a public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
American carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visit Guam. China has built a large number of military installations on the Nansha Islands in recent years.
China's island of Yongsumi in the Nansha Islands.
In its statement, the United States Navy stated that the visit to Guam by the Ohio class nuclear submarine Nevada had enhanced cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating American capabilities, flexibility, operational readiness and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarine".
The whereabouts of the 14 thunder submarines in the U.S. Navy are usually strictly classified.
The secret surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the thunder submarines the most important survival weapon of the nuclear triad. This system also includes silo ballistic missiles located on the mainland of the United States, as well as bombers with nuclear warheads such as B-2 and B-52.
Talk to friends about the recent 26 per cent drop in Meta, the evaporation of the market value of $251 billion, and Zuckerberg's response to the "unprecedented competition."
Meta is essentially an advertising company whose income comes mainly from advertising, and the advertising company that makes money today has its own channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., whatever function is located, it's Meta's channel.
More than that, Meta is also the biggest advertising union, with a lot of Meta ads coming out of App, through Meta's advertising platform to make a difference.
But times have changed.
First, due to the restructuring of Apple privacy policies, Meta has had difficulty obtaining data from users, affecting the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it's obvious that it's possible for a user to allow App to access his own information, and most people's normal reaction is certainly not.
Next thing you know, if Google stabs me again, it'll have a bigger impact on Meta's income.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's income growth weakened.
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but that understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's income comes from China, mainly from China's maritime companies.
Meta has a few hundred people in Hong Kong and a few big agents on the mainland.
The Chinese company wants to expand its overseas market, Meta, which is an advertising channel that can't be bypassed, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, the byte TT is one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta earned a lot of money from the bytes in the last two years.
Every agency in the country is doing a by-by-by-by-by-by by-the-clock commercial at Meta, and the Grand Central District is doing a great job.
I haven't been special lately, but I'm sure it won't be better than before.
The stage of large-scale offshore burning of money by Chinese companies is over.
Third, new traffic channels are not expanding well.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets look not only at middle income but, more importantly, at what is expected in the future.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg said, "The Won Universe."
The meta-cosm should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the period of realization of the meta-cosmos is longer, and the story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years.
So in the next two years, it's gonna be a tough time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook now, with $100 billion to $200 billion in income a year, and it's actually very crisisy now, and there's no safe moat compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although some of his social software is now high in daily life and mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp and so on, Facebook has little confidence in the rapid development of tiktok, which is a wink between subversion.
And the notion of the unexplorable universe, with no prospect of success in a short time, makes Facebook very dangerous. That's why Zuckerberg changed his name and kept looking for a new track, but I think his track selection was wrong, it was a no-turn road, and that's some of my thoughts, for information.
