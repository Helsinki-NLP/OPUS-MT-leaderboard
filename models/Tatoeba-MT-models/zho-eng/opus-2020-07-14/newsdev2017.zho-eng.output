New issues in water engineering in California
After a major water management area in California revealed that the administration led by Governor Jerry Brown would provide government funds to complete the planning of two giant water tunnels, a number of commentators and a State Councillor indicated that they would like to know more who would cover the $16 billion proposed water project supported by the Governor.
According to commentators, the government funds mentioned in the L.A. MWD Thursday may be contrary to the State ' s long-standing commitment to the realization of Brown ' s vision to dig two 35-mile long tunnels to facilitate the flow of water from the Sacramento River south and supply primarily to the vision of the central and southern Californian region, where local water areas (not California itself) will bear the costs.
The $248 million initial cost of these two tunnels has been the subject of an ongoing federal audit without the approval of the regulatory authorities.
Some state councillors also ordered an in-state audit of tunnel expenses on Wednesday.
State spokesperson Nancy Vogel said on Thursday that although the account belonged to the L.A. Metropolitan Watershed, it would not use any ordinary state funds to complete the work at the current planning stage of the tunnels.
However, the opponents of the tunnel project and a group of taxpayers criticized it on Thursday, and Susan Egerman, a State Councillor at the State Legislature behind this week ' s audit order, asked the state government to clarify the situation on Thursday.
David Wolff, legislative director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, said, "It's a scam."
I think for yesterday's audit (request): there are far more questions than answers.
The tunnel project is supported by Brown and some politically influential water management areas and water users in central and southern California.
Supporters say that these two tunnels will benefit the environment and help California to ensure a safer water supply.
The opponents, on the other hand, expressed their concern that the state would divert too much water from the Sacramento River and the Bay of San Francisco through these two tunnels, thereby causing damage to northern California and thereby threatening the survival of the species there.
Due to uncertainty as to whether this massive expenditure would actually bring them enough water to reduce the price of water, the water management areas and other water management areas of large cities expected to extract water from tunnels have not yet made commitments to cover the costs.
These water management areas have also declared this year that they will not bear the cost of completing their current initial work until the project is approved by the regulatory authorities.
On Thursday, a monthly report issued by the L.A. Water Management Area on the tunnel project stated: "The state has indicated that any additional funding required to complete the planning phase will be provided from state or federal sources ... "
The spokesperson for the L.A. Water Management Area, Bob Muir, said that after all the local water management areas had invested in the project (including $63 million from his own water management area), "foreseeably" the state would use government funds to help complete the planning phase.
He asked State spokesman Vogel further questions.
Vogel indicated that the State intended to draw funds from user fees for the existing water network that had been in use for half a century (i.e. the State Water Project) to complete the planning of the tunnel project.
However, the opponents of the tunnel project turned to a bill passed by the State Councillors in 2009, which they said prohibited the State from investing in the tunnels unless the water services benefiting from them committed themselves to bearing the cost of the tunnels.
The long-standing opponent of the proposed tunnel, Patricia Schefferer, environmental consultant, said: "The project contractor had promised to bear the cost of the project, but they avoided the obligation through financial tricks."
So, the question is where the money is going to go.
Corporate groups have petitioned China about cyber security laws.
A coalition of international enterprise groups called on China to change the proposed cybersecurity rules and warned that they would undermine trade and isolate the country ...
Forty-six groups from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America have jointly signed a letter addressed to Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang, reflecting the degree of global concern that information security rules may restrict or prevent the entry of information security products into Chinese markets.
The signatures include the United States Chamber of Commerce, the European Services Forum and groups from Japan, South Korea and Mexico.
China ' s proposed rules on cybersecurity will require suppliers to demonstrate to the relevant Chinese authorities how safe products work and to request that information on Chinese citizens be stored in China ...
The latest letter issued on Wednesday states that this may make data more vulnerable to theft and may reduce access to Chinese clients.
Chemical explosion in Tianjin: the first anniversary of a deadly catastrophe
Zhang's dreamer said the public should know what happened in the Tianjin bombing.
Chinese leaders may wish to mark the first anniversary of the large explosion that killed 173 people in a silent manner, but not everyone.
Look at John Sudworth's report from Tianjin.
If this magnitude of disaster occurs anywhere else in the world, its anniversary will almost always be reflected in a profound national reflection.
That's not true in China.
The commemorations held elsewhere were being kept low on the same day as Jin City was holding a memorial service for the dead firemen.
Communist-controlled media were told what to say and what to say, and some survivors and relatives of deceased were warned not to speak out.
But Zhang Mongwan, 23 years old, won't remain silent.
"In this anniversary, the public should have a way of knowing what happened," he told me.
I don't want to be silent.
Last August 12th, Mr. Zhang was a radio operator for a fire brigade belonging to the army, only a kilometre from the explosion centre at the fire station.
He said, "The call came at 10:53 p.m., and then we started sending my teammates."
It takes 10 minutes for them to get there.
Firefighters from other parts of the city also arrive to deal with a fire in a chemical warehouse.
None of them may be aware of the large quantities of volatile and toxic substances stored on the site in violation of the law, far exceeding the permitted amount and not being properly managed.
A shipment of nitro fibre (a chemical used for nail polish) was allowed for dry treatment and then ignited at the heat of summer, causing a fire.
The fire then spread to areas where there was a large stockpile of ammonium nitrate fertilizer (800 tons).
The ensuing explosion destroyed the windows of the fire station and caused the roof to collapse, while Monsignor was waiting by the radio for reports from the fire scene.
But those reports will never come again.
"When I saw the mushroom clouds, I fell into despair," he said to me.
I know what it means to my friends.
That night, his fire station sent 26 firefighters to the fire scene, 8 of whom never returned.
Many of the firemen who survived suffered serious burns and other injuries.
In two large explosions, the largest explosion was observed as an earthquake, and the blast wave was still felt many kilometres away.
The total damage caused by the disaster exceeds $1 billion, including more than 300 damaged buildings.
The total number of victims was 173, of whom 104 were firefighters.
The remains of eight of the victims were never found.
Official government investigations attribute responsibility to corruption, political relations and the collusion of officials, leading to a high level of discipline and disregard for the security system.
The warehouse should not have been built so close to a residential building.
More than 100 officials and business executives are facing some kind of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
Thus, while the Government can point to the progress made, such as the rehabilitation of thousands of homes and compensation for the population, there are persistent and sensitive issues.
The disaster revealed a systemic rift in which rapid economic growth was a priority and the lack of independent oversight was an indisputable fact.
The courage and sense of responsibility that night were indisputable, but the side of firefighters as heroes was another sad picture.
That's a picture of the firemen as victims who, without proper knowledge, were sent to an avoidable, man-made disaster.
Zhang Monfan has now left the fire department, but will attend the ceremony in Tianjin.
He will deliver a word in his heart for his fallen comrades.
What I'd like to tell them most is that I went to see your parents and they were fine.
Leave it to my parents.
I'm your family now.
I'll do my best for you.
The cold spring may affect the hunting season of Scotland's pine chickens.
This year's chicken season in Scotland will be delayed due to a reduction in the number of pine chickens due to the cold climate.
Because many of the early chicks did not survive this cold spring, some of the estates have delayed hunting.
In an opening address for the pine hunting season, the Scottish Huntskeepers Association indicated that the pine chicken hunting would maintain more jobs than the major festivals in Edinburgh.
But the animal protection charity OneKind calls for an end to the brutal killing of these birds.
The director of the organization, Harry Hayden, said, "Maintaining rich birds for hunting in the hunting grounds requires a lot of work and always involves highly controversial practices."
It is no wonder that the public is gradually taking a negative view of this so-called sports approach and calling on the government to regard it as a cruel and unnecessary practice for some very small Scottish people.
But the landowners insisted that they were committed to protection, and that pine hunting was vital to the rural economy.
Alex Hoggle, President of the Scottish Huntskeepers Association, said that the industry maintained 8,800 full-time jobs per year in remote areas and became a "employment-intensive belt" for some uncertain periods.
He said, "Scotland has no inherent "hunting" culture compared to many other European countries, and many people do not understand the economic impact of the hunting season on the country."
Mr. Hogg said that the number of full-time jobs dependent on hunting exceeded the sum of the jobs created by the Edinburgh International Festival of Arts, the Marginal Festival, the disaggregated performances and the New Year's Eve event.
He added: "There are real concerns about employment in Scotland ' s rural areas, particularly in the oil and gas sector, so that hunters and their families would like to see the industry grow. "
We want to work with the Scottish government to ensure that hard-working people can continue to rely on these jobs in the future.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that eight golden eagles are being illegally hunted around the pine chicken hunt.
Many hunters admit that pine hunting is not generally popular, but the Scottish Huntskeepers Association states that the industry has "has made significant progress in best practices".
The opening day of the rooster hunting season is traditionally known as "The 12th Magnificent."
However, this recreational activity remains controversial and the management of the pine chicken hunting ground has been branded by some wildlife protection organizations as persecuting predators.
On Thursday, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds indicated that in less than five years, eight labeled gold sculptures had disappeared in the Monaria Mountains, south-east of Inverness.
The wildlife charity believed that the gold sculpts had been illegally hunted around the pine chicken hunting ground, while their satellite tracking tags had been destroyed.
The Environment Minister of Scotland, Rosana Cunningham, said that the reports were "very disturbing and disappointing".
Ms. Cunningham has instructed the relevant officials to analyse the signs of some 90 surviving and missing labelled eagles to determine whether there is a pattern of suspicious activity.
The Scottish Hunting Fields Group accused the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds of trying to create anti-hunting sentiment before the pine chicken hunting season and stated that there was no conclusive evidence that the birds were actually killed in the Monalia area.
Rio Olympics 2016: Bronnie Pec took a silver slip for Britain.
Peachy of England won a silver medal in the trampoline project.
Bronnie Pecchirón took the silver and became the first British female sportswoman to win the Olympic trampoline medal.
Twenty-five-year-old Paige scored 0.425 cents less than gold medal winner, and Canadian player Rosanna McLennan scored 56.465 cents as Olympic champion.
China, world champion Li Dan picked the bronze medal, while Catherine Driscoll, another British player, won sixth place.
I can't believe I won an Olympic medal.
"I'm really happy. " Paige was very excited to say.
I didn't expect to get a medal, but I did my best, so I was happy that all the training and hard work had been rewarded.
I'm glad to be in the finals with Catherine, and it's made history as long as one of the players moves to the finals, and we have two.
Before winning the Olympics silver medal, Pec's best achievement in international events was the fifth in the 2015 Danish World Cup.
It was the first Olympics in 2000, and this Olympics was the first time a British female contestant had entered the finals.
Reactions after winning medals.
Nathan Bailey, the only male contestant in the British delegation for the Man's Jumper Project on Saturday, was excited.
Hannah Veran, a gymnast who participated in two Olympics, did not hesitate to praise Pec's achievements.
Paige has a degree of honor in biology at Sheffield University.
Rio Olympics 2016: Fiji fans celebrate the seven-man football gold medal
A 12-year-old boy ran over the sugar cane field and went to the nearest television station half a mile away to watch the game.
After Fiji won its first Olympic medal, the celebration was extraordinary.
The bank was closed, the shop was closed, the partyers took over the streets of the capital, Suva, dancing, singing and cheering.
In the seven-man football finals at Dodoro Stadium, Fiji beat the British gold medal at 43-7.
Tens of thousands of people on the island put down their business and watched this historic game.
Fiji celebrates its first Olympic medal in history.
Many supporters, wearing Fijian-character colored clothes and football jerseys, bring their flags to the team.
At the end of the whistle, the ecstasy trouped into the streets and cheered.
"Some people even parked their cars on the busy streets of Suva and took the Fiji flag and joined the celebration, ignoring the light traffic jam they caused... " The Fiji Times reports.
The celebration will continue until the weekend and next week.
The Irish Super Football League: Finn Harper 0-5 is an enemy of Deloitte.
Aaron McNeff was fined two points for the first half of Finn Park.
With the 5-0 Fenhaup team, the Deli City team is in second place in the league.
The two dots in the half-course of Aaron McNeefe, both of which were taken by the Deli City team, were obtained for breaking the rules of Lucas Shubert.
Soon after Nathan Boyle opened in the second half of the game, Schubert entered the fourth round, and then Keith Ward's late snag cast led to the collapse of Finn Park.
The Deli City team leads by one point, and they're going to fight a encounter at Brandyville on Monday night.
This is the first time the Deli City team has won in three games facing the Northwest this season, and the underperforming Finn Harpers have hardly caused them any trouble.
Although the foul appears to be outside the hairball area, after Charlene Cole broke Schulbert's rules, McNeff hit the first round of the ball in 17 minutes.
There's no doubt that the second penalty was that former Deloitte midfield player Barry Molloy knocked down Shubert, so that McNough would again expand the score to 2-0 in three minutes after the first shot.
Eight minutes after the kick-off, Poear used a return ball from Dean Jarvis to calmly hit a shot.
Gerald Doherty, the gatekeeper of the Deli City team, spent a night of idleness, but he also made a brilliant rescue and shot David Scully at the best slot in his main game.
In 83 minutes, Schubert carried the ball through Cole's door and shortly afterwards, Ward crossed with a fine high ball Finnhape's watchman, Richard Bush.
This game is the greatest victory of the Deli City team in the league and provides a solid foundation for a female with the Kirk City team.
The University of the Highlands and the Islands, Inverness College, has failed on a massive scale.
The entire class of 20 students may not be able to pass the advanced media course examinations administered by the Inverness College of the University of the Highlands and the Islands.
The majority of students in this course are 17 and 18 years of age and wish to enter university on the basis of what they have achieved in their studies.
The Highlands and Islands University Inverness College indicated that quality assurance procedures in schools were functioning properly and that the Scottish Academic Qualifications Management Board (SQA) was also conducting investigations.
A spokesperson for the Scottish Education Management Board said that the country-wide High Media Assessment for 2016 had been "as scheduled".
All 20 students enrolled in this course, which is managed and graded by the Inverness College of the University of the Highlands.
Many of these students are young people from rural areas who are taught online, but also have to travel regularly from their places of residence (e.g. Lohab) to this college in Inverness.
The father of one of the students stated that at least 10 other students had shown up after her daughter posted her work on social media without receiving any credits.
He told the BBC News Network Scotland Online that about five other students who studied the same course at Inverness College at the University of the Islands in the past year had contacted them about the same situation.
This situation means that his daughter cannot ensure access to the University of Glasgow, but because she has acquired some qualifications during her studies, she will be able to obtain admissions from another university.
However, the girl's father said that other students studying the Academy's media programme were not so lucky, that they were now "suffering" and that it was not certain that their course would be re-examined and awarded enough points to enable them to enter university.
The Inverness College is an affiliate of the University of the Highlands and the Islands.
Diana Rawlings, Dean and Chief Executive Officer, Inverness College, University of the Highlands and the Islands, said: "We take the results and academic achievements of our students very seriously. "
The excellent HMIE report that we received earlier this year and the steady progress we have achieved over the years in the areas of continuing education and higher education are evidence of this.
As we do every year, we are reviewing all published achievements and comparing them with the expected scores for each student.
For this particular course, a regular quality assurance process has been implemented, and the credit award authority auditor recently reported that "the award and management of the score have a significant advantage" and confirmed that "the assessment judgement is in line with national standards".
At our request, the Scottish Education Board is currently investigating the matter.
A spokesperson for the Scottish Education Management Board said: "We are pleased that the High Media Assessment 2016 was conducted as expected, and it provides candidates with an opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the subject."
Many candidates showed strong performance, and we saw a small increase in A-C compliance under the same qualifications compared to last year.
The examination was designed to conform to the previous test papers and sample papers and to our curriculum and evaluation norms.
The Kilmanok Blade Bloodwashing brothers were sentenced to prison.
Jason Brighton was attacked with a samurai knife, a dagger and a double baton.
Two male suspects were imprisoned on charges of drug-related robbery and subsequent "blood washing" in East Al County, killing a man with a samurai knife.
The victim, Jason Braden, 38 years old, was repeatedly stabbed on 5 July 2015 during an attack on his home in Kilmanok.
In the High Court of Glasgow, James Clark, 36 years old, charged with murder and sentenced to at least 22 years ' imprisonment.
His brother John, 38 years old, was charged with less serious manslaughter and sentenced to 10 years ' imprisonment.
In sentencing the brothers to prison, Judge Bill Dunlop pointed out that they were carrying out a "cruel, heartless, barbaric attack".
He rejects any argument that Mr. Braden has been waiting for them to show up with a samurai knife.
Judge Dunlop added: "You conspired to break in with at least one dagger and double-barrel. "
Although Jason Brighton may be a drug dealer, he's also a son, a father and a friend.
And you killed him.
After the two were sentenced to prison, Detective David Moran, who was in charge of the investigation, said: "James Clark and John Clark's brutal acts led to the death of Jason Brighten."
It is heartbreaking to be killed at the age of 38 and in such terrible circumstances, while the family of the victim is forced to endure.
According to statements heard earlier by the court, the brothers from Kilmanok decided to take a gold bracelet from Mr. Braden, which they had given him in exchange for the price of drugs.
The two men went to the victim's home after drinking alcohol and drugs, covered their faces with a scarf and had a dagger and a martial arts double-tape stick.
The sword used in the killing is believed to be the object of the deceased.
Neighbors said they could see the Clark Brothers attacking Mr. Braden because Bradon was sitting on the couch next to the window and could hear him screaming.
In his address to the court, the prosecutor, Richard Goddard, said: "There was an ongoing, insane attack on the victim."
Then the murder scene was described as a "blood wash".
In addition to the stab wound, Mr. Braden suffered blunt trauma in the course of the attack.
Three days later, he died at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmanok.
The brothers denied the murder.
At the time of the testimony, there were 38 priors, including one attempted murder, James Clark, who said, "I didn't intend to do it. It was an accident."
There were 23 priors, John Clark, who said that he was only involved in helping his brother, who claimed that he was being attacked by Mr. Braden.
A man died of a violent shaking of a young child.
David Sinclair admitted to killing his children in 2012 at his home in East Kilbride.
The man who swayed in anger for not feeding and killed his youngest child was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.
On 6 December 2012, at his home in Kiir Brad East, South Lanak County, David Sinclair was in a state of "one-time out of control" shattering only Joshua, four months old.
The cause of death was discovered after a medical expert had conducted a case review.
34-year-old Sinclair was initially charged with murder, but pleaded guilty and sentenced to manslaughter.
When he was sentenced to prison by the High Court of Glasgow, Judge Lord Blackdale said to Sinclair, "You attacked him by shaking his baby son, causing him fatal harm."
You must have known you were shaking him, but you didn't reveal it.
It was only after a lot of medical research that you admitted to what you did.
Your wife trusts you.
Now she feels misled by you and can't support you anymore.
Lord Blackdale said that Joshua's death had a tragic effect on all concerned and added, "Nothing can bring Joshua back to the earth."
The court had learned that Sinclair and his wife, Costi, had taken Joshua for a swim on the day the child died and then went shopping in East Kilbride.
17:30, Kristi Sinclair went out to find her mother and sister.
In just 11 minutes, she got a call from Sinclair, and his voice sounded "stunned."
And he said to her, "Joshua, breathe badly, come home."
Then he hung up the phone and called 999.
The baby was taken urgently to Hermes Hospital, where she died.
Initially, Joshua ' s cause of death had not been determined, but the medical team had reviewed the case and found evidence of eye and brain trauma caused by non-accidental circumstances close to the time of death.
Dr. Peter Richards, consultant for paediatric neurosurgery at the Oxford Radcliffe Hospital, said: "This evidence suggests that the baby has suffered more severe injuries than normal life use ... "
Counselor, the Royal Counsel, Ian Dugt, told the court that Sinclair was extremely sorry for what he did.
Rio Olympics 2016: Chloe Tatton seems to have challenged Yulia Yefimova.
British player Tutton missed 200 meters of frog-drawn bronze.
When the Russian player was ahead of her on the 200-metre Frog Swimming Project, the British player Chloe Tatton seemed to question the controversial swimmer, Yulia Yefimova, who appeared at the Rio Olympics.
Yefimova was allowed to take part in the contest and to take a silver medal following an appeal against a stimulant ban, while Tutton won a fourth.
And the 20-year-old swimmer from Wales said, "I'd rather be a clean game."
I can't help but wonder who's on the field.
I'm not happy, but that's what happened.
Yafimova, the Asian military winner, even three days ago, did not know whether he was allowed to compete.
Although I don't want to see anyone being denied access to this campaign, I don't think that's the right thing to do.
She shouldn't be in the game, and a 20-year-old English player deserves a medal.
KIMto Ricco beat Yafimova, the Asian military winner, and won the Japanese team ' s seventh gold medal for the 2016 Rio Olympics.
Chinese contestant Slyrin won the bronze medal, only 0.06 seconds ahead of the fourth-ranked Tutton.
Tatton's other British teammate, 20-year-old Molly Lenshaw, won sixth place.
Tatton adds: "It's a bit frustrating to get a fourth, no matter who you are."
It's a great experience, and I'm a little disappointed with the fourth grade.
I lost the medal. It was a dream.
But it's a great experience in the finals, and I'm encouraged by it in the years to come.
It's a bit frustrating, but it'll make me stronger in the future, and it'll make me more eager to win medals, hopefully I'll be closer to medals next time.
Tutton's English record in the 200-metre frog swim finals is only 0.01 seconds slow.
"Everybody should have a second chance." Yefimova.
Yefimova said she was tired of answering questions about her past with stimulants and defending her right to participate in the Rio Olympics.
She was banned for 16 months in 2013 because she found traces of a synthetic metabolic steroid in her body.
The International Sports Arbitration Tribunal (CAS) provides that athletes who have previously been sanctioned cannot be barred from participating in the Rio Olympics.
The International Sports Arbitral Tribunal heard my appeal and I won.
She explained: "If someone doesn't like it and disagrees, they can go to the International Sports Arbitral Tribunal and say it."
I don't support the use of stimulants nor do I ever use stimulants.
The latter is not my fault at all.
Everyone should have a second chance.
When you drive and get a ticket, no one will put you in jail.
Ben Proud's 50-metre free swim final.
Earlier, Ben Proud was promoted to the 50-metre free swim final with a British record.
The 21-year-old Commonwealth Games champion Proud swam 21:54 seconds of success to the 5th grade of the 5th Friday final.
Your delegation is rude and rude.
India's Minister of Sports, Vijay Gore, showed up at the Rio Olympics and often appeared on the podium to cheer Indian athletes and take a selfie after the race.
However, according to the Indian newspaper Trust, his and many accompanying persons ' irregularities apparently provoked the anger of Olympic officials who tried to break into the area without showing proper evidence and were subjected to harsh language when they were examined.
Vijay Gore (photo taken in July) justified his actions.
On Wednesday, after Gore and his companions tried to break into the restricted area of the gymnasium and the fields of Swords and Taekwondo, Olympic organizers wrote warning that if Gore didn't make any further improvements, he would be disqualified.
In 2016, Sarah Peterson, the continental manager of the Rio Olympic Committee, wrote: "We have received reports on several occasions of attempts by your sports minister to bring unauthorized persons into the area of the race that requires authorization to enter. "
Staff reported that when they tried to explain that the situation was not allowed, members of the line of ministers became aggressive and rude and forced their staff on several occasions.
The letter goes on to say: "If our courtesy team learns of such acts again, your Minister of Sports will be disqualified and his privileges at the Olympic Games will be revoked."
The head of the Indian delegation described the incident as "a matter that was not a problem but was treated as a problem", while Gore himself said he had done nothing wrong and attributed it to "mistake."
He said on Twitter: "As far as I know, we've always followed all the rules and regulations."
We are committed to the Olympic spirit and support our Indian players.
Otherwise, it's a frustrating Olympic Games for India, and so far no medals have been paid.
Disappointing fans say on social media that Michael Phelps has now won 26 medals, as much as the total number of medals in Indian history.
Several prominent contestants have been eliminated, including the shooter Abinaf Bendra, the gold medal winner of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
He won fourth place at the Olympics.
The writer and columnist Shoha de tweets: "This is a waste of money and opportunity."
But there are still some bright hopes as the contestants fight, golf, tennis, fields and, of course, badminton.
The Indian female gymnastics player, Deepa Kamaka, will join the horse finals on Sunday to brag about her two-week death jump, and the other athletes rarely try to do this Peva jump.
For a country with a population of 1.25 billion, the low number of medals in India is always alarming.
Analysts say there are many reasons for this.
India's sports program is cricket, but cricket is not an Olympic program.
India has not invested much in the infrastructure and training of Olympic players, and the first jumper used by Kamaka was made from parts of an old motorcycle.
Parents traditionally pay more attention to learning than to sports.
And sports management has been plagued by corruption.
In 2012, the Indian Olympic Association elected leaders with criminal charges against them, in violation of the IOC statute, and the International Olympic Committee suspended the Association.
At the Sochi Winter Olympics, three Indian contestants were not even allowed to represent the country, carry flags and wear badges.
They can only participate in the Winter Olympics as independent athletes.
The Tjelan flight from Boston to Sacramento landed in South Dakota, where people were injured as a result of the turbulence.
According to the Colombian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in Sacramento, a Tjelan flight was hit by a turbulence on Thursday night, injuring 22 passengers and two crew members and forcing them to land urgently.
Flight 429 from Boston to Sacramento landed in Lapid City, South Dakota, at approximately 7.30 p.m. local time.
The flight indicated that the wounded were taken to a hospital for examination.
Tjelan Air has indicated that personnel have been deployed to assist the wounded, and a replacement plane has flown to Lapid City to carry the remaining passengers to Sacramento.
The DEA missed the opportunity to ban medical marijuana.
The answer is sad: unlikely.
This is a missed opportunity that could further delay the potential treatment needed by countless people.
So far, there is only one research-level cannabis source approved by the federal government at the University of Mississippi.
There's a positive news today that the DEA has announced that it will now also allow other places to apply for approval of similar practices.
The hope is that the amount and variety of cannabis used for scientific research may increase.
While this is to be regarded as a success in the field of research, it is largely symbolic, because no matter how much cannabis is available, it makes sense if it is still difficult to obtain.
Imagine a product locked behind a door despite its demand.
In response to the demand for this product, someone made a strange decision to make more products but not open the locked door.
Cannabis is the product, and cannabis is designated as a controlled substance that is the locked door.
That's what medical marijuana is all about.
Since cannabis belongs to a group of controlled substances (meaning that it is "not currently recognized for medical purposes and has a high potential for abuse”), there are still a number of important obstacles that need to be overcome in order to open this door.
Researchers who may need it are usually required to go first to the Drug Enforcement Agency, because the department is required to grant a licence to initiate scientific research.
Even after a licence has been granted, in order to study a category of controlled substances, research institutions have to install heavy safes and advanced security systems, which will cost a lot.
There is also a more subjective consideration that a study of a controlled substance can be conducted only with the approval of your academic institution in the first place.
Even if individual teachers want to do such research, university leadership may not want to cause trouble or potential repercussions from negative reporting.
This was the case at the University of Arizona when Dr. Su Heasley was dismissed after seeking a medical marijuana test.
Heasley finally had to seek private funding for her project. In April, just seven years after the research project was originally developed, her pilot project became the first medical marijuana test approved by the Drug Enforcement Agency for research on post-traumatic stress disorder treatment for veterans.
And then, after years of institutional obstacles, the National Drug Abuse Institute of the United States of America got the last key to the lock.
Today, it is the largest federal public fund to finance cannabis research and the only supplier of cannabis itself.
Even now that more medical cannabis is liberated for research purposes, the agency will have to approve any research it finances.
The problem, however, is the last word in its name: "abuse."
In my interview with Donald Abrahams at San Francisco University for the documentary Weed, he said that one of the main responsibilities of the Institute was to study potential substance abuse rather than to study it as a drug.
In the Abrands phrase.
Even if a study served all the obstacles mentioned above, the barrier might still remain open as long as it was not aimed at the harm of medical marijuana but at its benefits.
Think about it: a quick search of the National Medical Library in the United States (admittedly not scientific) showed that there have been 1,434 papers on medical marijuana in the last five years.
The results of that search also revealed that only 57 papers related to the benefits of medical marijuana.
Most papers study the harms of cannabis, for example, "Blessed experiences caused by the neurological transmission of cannabis, pancreatic inflammation" and "The risk of cannabis use and lung cancer".
This imbalance reflects a highly false picture.
The road to medical cannabis research is paved by surprises and hypocrisy everywhere.
While the DEA continues to maintain a classification of a category of controlled substances and considers that there is no medical benefit, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services holds a patent for a wide range of pharmaceutical uses of cannabis.
The Drug Enforcement Agency continues to classify cannabis, together with heroin and ecstasy, as a high potential drug of abuse, although the former Chief Executive Judge of the Drug Enforcement Agency, Francis Yang, does not accept this.
Under strict medical conditions, weed is much safer than much of the food we consume on a daily basis.
For example, a raw meal of 10 potatoes can cause toxic effects.
By contrast, it's not possible to eat enough marijuana to kill a person in terms of his physical condition.
The natural form of cannabis is one of the safest therapeutic active substances known to humans.
Any rational analysis suggests that cannabis can be used safely within the regular procedures of supervised medical care.
Again, it's the opinion of one of the DEA's own judges.
Yet almost 30 years have passed and little has changed.
Whether we realize it or not, we accept a certain degree of hypocrisy in our daily lives.
Maybe we never have the strength to admit it, or we're so silent and stunned that we seem to be unattended.
But for the hypocrisy of federal medical marijuana policy, it's worth standing up to the truth.
The patient's life depends on it, such as Charlotte Figi, who needs medical marijuana to relieve epilepsy, and a lot of other patients.
There's a plant that offers so many benefits but is still locked behind these locked doors, which is worth discussing.
Bloody beet root: Donald Trump is the blonde Berlusconi.
The bloody beet root is known for the electronic dance song.
According to these musicians, Trump has media dominance just like Berlusconi.
The founder of the Electronic Dancing Punk bloody beet root, Riffo, said to CNN: "You know, Italy used to be a Berlusconi. For me, Trump is like a Berlusconi with blond hair."
The Republican presidential candidate and the politician of the Italian media tycoon are well known for their super-popular character, their skills to attract media attention and their ability to tell stories in the media.
Like the bloody beet root, Reeford was well known for his electronic dance song, and in 2013 he worked with artists, including legend Sir Paul McCartney and electronic music pop singer Greta Swaber Beecher, to create the song "The History of Falling Love".
Lifford was born in 1977 in the small town of Bassano, outside Venice, Italy, and punk rock and roll was born about that same time, and this musician tattooed the numbers "77" on his chest.
Lifford wears his symbolic black mask and says, "English is not my mother tongue, so I don't know about your country."
I've been trying to explore, and I've been trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
Riveri offered the Americans to watch "Television Politics", a documentary exploring Berlusconi's monopoly over Italian media.
Lifford says the documentary describes how Berlusconi is driving Italy crazy and adds that Trump has a similar effect on the United States.
He said, "You can see how a man can reverse everything and distort everything as he pleases."
To me, Trump is not a good thing for this country.
Two Turkish sailors were arrested for smuggling £500 million in drugs in anti-narcotics operations.
Two Turkish men accused of smuggling £500 million worth of cocaine by boat in the North Sea were sentenced to imprisonment for at least 20 years.
Following the discovery of 3 tons of A-type drugs on the Merchant Hamar, about 100 miles off the coast of Aberdeen, Momen Shahin and Amin Ozman were found guilty in a trial in the High Court of Glasgow.
According to the information received, in 2015, this anti-narcotic operation captured the single largest single case of maritime cocaine shipments ever discovered in Europe.
Momen Shahin and Amy Ozman were arrested for their involvement in a huge drug deal.
The amount of drugs seized on board is one of the biggest drug deals in British history.
The drug ship was registered in Tanzania as a tugboat, headed from Istanbul to Tenerife, then to the North Sea, where the drugs were hidden in a specially modified hidden cabin.
The smuggling vessel was intercepted by the Royal Navy frigate HMS Somerset and the Border Guard armed speedboat HMC Valiant.
The High Court of Glasgow sentenced 47-year-old Shahin to 22 years ' imprisonment and 51-year-old Ozmann to 20 years ' imprisonment.
Judge Lord Kinclav said to the two criminals that the quantity of drugs was "not so big" and that drug trafficking had a "destructive effect" on the general public and society.
The judge said, "You used a boat for the transnational trafficking of cocaine, which is in fact transcontinental, and committed one of the most serious commercial crimes."
The judge told Captain Shahin that he was not at the top of the drug-trafficking tree structure, but that he played an important role in the crime, while Lieutenant Captain Ozman played a slightly lighter role.
Officials on board the Hamar tugboat received a secret report from the French National Customs Intelligence Investigation Service that, after landing in Aberdeen, they had drilled a steel plate to find a hidden cabin, found 128 bags of cocaine, weighing 3.2 tons, and estimated the value of the street black market to be approximately £512 million.
The Royal Navy boarded the mother ship Hamar last year.
There's three tons of cocaine on board.
At the time of the raid, the ship's ballast was filled with tons of Class A drugs.
The ship was stopped in the North Sea on its way from Bosphorus to South America.
The entrance to the drug hideout was found under the closet of a crew member's dormitory, and the opening was blocked by cement.
Shahin and Ozman were found guilty of carrying and hiding cocaine on board the ship from 20 February to 23 April last year and suspected of cocaine trafficking between 21 April and 23 April.
The two men, who had been in the shipping industry since the end of their studies, were first offenders, accepted the verdict of the jury but maintained their innocence.
The charges against the other four men were found to be unsubstantiated.
The lawyer for Shahin, Jonathan Crowe, said that this married father with two sons on his knees was an honourable mule.
He said, "Someone was involved in the transportation of drugs."
A man who can command the ship.
As far as the hierarchy of drug traffickers is concerned, Mr. Shahin is not at the top of the drug-trafficking tree structure, but at the lower level.
The absolute amount of cocaine on board means that the drugs must be transported with cranes.
It took the police days to examine the ship in detail before the drugs were distributed into these boxes.
During the court hearing, it was informed that Shahin had been nominated as the captain of the tugboat Hamar in February 2015.
Mr. Crowe said that Shahin was "deeply sad" about missing the important stage of his 9-year-old daughter's and 13-year-old son's growth and "wanted to go home to Turkey."
The men have not seen their families since their detention in April 2015, and their families are running for visas.
Ozyman's lawyer, Di Moore, said that Ozman was "extremely eager" to see his family, but knew that it was still "extreme hope" for the foreseeable future.
In his statement following today ' s sentencing, the Crown Attorney-General of Scotland, David Harvey, said: "The international drug trade knows no borders. We are working closely to ensure that we prevail, in accordance with our natural duty to abolish the drug trade. "
" Scotland ' s pursuit of criminals has truly been global in scope, and in this case we have given organized crime a major economic blow ... "
Every cabin on this ship is filled with drugs, including space below deck.
This package of contraband was found hidden in the ship's laundry room by the inspector.
Mr. Harvey added: "The case against the tugboat Hamar was discovered on the basis of secret reports provided by the French authorities and obtained the quick cooperation of the Tanzanian Attorney General, the ship ' s registered place, in order to be able to board and inspect the vessel. "
" We obtained key shipping records in Guyana, and then our investigation went from Guyana to Spain, where we learned important information about the ship ' s stopover in the Canary Islands ... "
We're also working with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to put together specific elements of evidence.
Despite credible information that the Hamar is carrying a large quantity of drugs, the relevant British authorities cannot board and inspect international waters without the permission of the Tanzanian Government, which has never previously authorized such authorization.
The Head of the International Justice and Organized Crime Department of the Crown Prosecution Service of Scotland, Sue Patten, stated: "The Criminal Justice Adviser to the Public Prosecution Service in Tanzania has acted quickly and accurately and has obtained the approval of the Tanzanian authorities to board and inspect the vessel within 24 hours of receiving the information. "
Under international maritime law, the United Kingdom cannot carry out boarding and inspection of vessels with foreign flags in international waters unless authorized by the specific law of that State to act.
We wouldn't have been able to bring those people to justice if it hadn't been for the speed with which our criminal justice advisers acted.
The cameraman, Brian Laumaine, is looking at the rotting "Orient Express."
These are pictures of an abandoned train in Belgium taken by Brian Laumayne, a photographer currently residing in Rotterdam.
The photos show the rusty surface of the train, the broken seat, the dusty window and the small crew room.
This is the car known as the East Express, but it belongs to the Belgian national operator.
A city explorer took these remarkable pictures, which are the wreckage of a bus that used to be one of the best ways to travel.
Their glorious days are long gone, leaving only the cars and locomotives of the following vehicles to rot in the train station, and this is the site favoured by photographers and explorers.
The 40-year-old cameraman in Rotterdam, Brian Laumaine, took these weird pictures showing the rusty appearances of abandoned trains, broken chairs, dusted windows and floors, and a small crew room.
Train cars and locomotives are abandoned in a Belgian railway station, but they attract urban explorers.
The trains were a luxury symbol from 1883 to 2009, when they operated with their legendary reputations.
This locomotive was used about 50 years ago by the Belgian national railway company.
After 126 years of operating on the railroad, the last train service named the East Express went from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, ending a glorious history.
The East Express is famous for operating between Paris and Istanbul.
In 1883, when IBC started operating the train line, it was called the East Express.
In 1891, it was known as the Eastern Express, and by the 1930s, it began to operate regularly throughout Europe.
Don't confuse it with the privately operated Venice Simplun East Express.
The number of lily cars of the international sleeper company, which is still alive, is extremely small.
This photo shows that the equipment in the narrow mechanic's room is rusting, the instrument has not been removed, and the wires are exposed.
Laumaine says this pilot's room is a little claustrophobic, and it must be a lot of noise.
These abandoned locomotives and cars have become popular sites for photographers and explorers.
After visiting these forgotten trains in Belgium, Laumen said to the Daily Postal Tourist Channel: "I can really feel the way this train was used throughout the season."
On the journey, a gentleman with a tall hat and a beautiful lady in her clothes.
The make-up artist, Katlyn Garowe, changed into Bast Brast of "Destructed Development."
Catherine Garowe, a Texas man, attracted a lot of YouTube fans with her impressive makeup skills, commentary and transformational images.
However, her latest role shift, becoming Buster Brass of Development Block, is quite incredible from anyone's standards.
In a three-minute video uploaded to her "Kiki G" YouTube channel, Ms. Garowe slowly and methodically turned herself into that hook player.
At the end of the video clip, she even used some music from the play to create a brilliant and strange atmosphere.
At the start of the video, the genius make-up artist showed her regular blonde hair, female self.
And then, with the clever use of time-lapse photography, she slowly turned into a bald, with her glasses on, "Mother's Good Child," by Tony Haile, Bast Bras.
Ms. Garowe achieved this transformation by such means as colour contact lenses, nose and eye-rounding, and by drawing Buster's face on her head.
A clever method: She slowly turned into a Buster Brass in Tony Haile's play with the clever use of time-lapse photography technology.
In filming the video, she also imitates the character and habits of that popular television character, which is so colossal to tighten her chin.
This video, shared on YouTube, has been viewed over 45,000 times, and online users have praised the make-up artist for his skill:
"You're very talented," an online friend wrote under Ms. Garowe's post.
During the video, she also imitates the character and habits of that fanatical TV character.
"You can get into the role while doing this, and I love it this way," added another online user.
The blogger, Caitlin Garowe, who was formerly a part of Parks and Plays, Ron Swanson, has also succeeded in viral marketing.
She said to her followers on YouTube that she wanted to make makeup change every week in the near future.

The father of Lancaster County was denied access to his children's school because of his dirty T-shirt.
A father with two children on his knees was prevented from entering the school where his children were found because of the children ' s sports day in an offensive sweatshirt.
Craig Macbeth, 36 years old, lives in Bernley, Lancaster County, where he said he was wearing the shirt with the slogan "Let's get out there and t**t it".
However, although he realized that he had made a mistake and then turned his T-shirt back and apologized, the next day he found himself barred from entering the school grounds.
The single father had been a director of a four-year park primary school in Cohen, Bernley City, and because of the ban, he was unable to pick up his children, and the school staff even called social services and the police.
Craig Macbeth, a 36-year-old resident of Bernley City, said that he had been barred from entering school since his offensive T-shirt appeared on his kid's sports day.
Mr. Macbeth accused Principal Sarah Mickeyley of overreacting.
He said he was unjustly punished for having worn the T-shirt in a hurry to watch the two kids' game.
The father has now resigned from the post of school director, and he says, "It was a mistake, and I was negligent."
When I put on that dress, I didn't think it was a sports day.
At the end of the game, we had a father's race, and the principal noticed my T-shirt and said it wasn't suitable.
I apologized for putting that dress back on, thinking it was over.
However, the 36-year-old father indicated that he had received an e-mail from the head of the school the following evening inviting him to interview the headmaster the following day, but he did not consider it necessary because he had already apologized.
Mr. Macbeth added: "The principal then called me and said I was forbidden to enter the school premises."
I found out that after the sports day, some parents went to Facebook and made some very strange comments about the matter, and then they got a lot of attention.
Any reasonable person would think it was an over-reacting.
Mr. Macbeth, editor of the online magazine Love Mini, said he believed that because of the ban, he could not even pick up his children on the last day of the semester.
However, this prompted the school and social services to call.
The hit T-shirt had a picture of Lester, the famous BBC comedy, "Let's go out and t**t it".
He said, "I told them I couldn't, because they forbid me from going to school."
Then I got a call from Social Services asking why I didn't pick up my daughter.
The school also called the police, because after almost 40 minutes I haven't picked up my daughter.
Mr. Macbeth claims that he was told that he was no longer allowed to enter school premises and that the prohibition remained in force until further notice.
He said he was also warned of a fine of £500 if he was found trespassing.
The headmaster of Park Elementary School, Sarah Mickeyley, says it's over.
"I can confirm that Mr. Macbeth has resigned and is no longer a director of this school."
It's over now, and I'm looking forward to returning to normal school in September.
Senator Joe Cooney of Bernley said the school had clear policies and guidelines.
He said, "We must all remember that when you assume roles such as parliamentarians or school directors, it means you have to be self-disciplined at a higher standard. Unfortunately, he failed to meet that standard this time."
Congressman Jonathan Nixon added that he didn't expect the school to ban him from entering and that it was exaggerated.
Nixon added: "He was stupid in that T-shirt when he apologized."
Lancaster County Police confirmed that they received a call from the school but were not present.
Sixty-five per cent of Venezuelans want to destroy Maduro. The question is whether they want to fight for it.
Two thirds of the Venezuelans wanted to dismiss President Nicholas Maduro, but the question seemed to be whether they were willing to fight for it.
The day after the National Electoral Commission announced that "no time" for this year's recall vote (and thus guaranteed Chávez rule until 2019), the people of Caracas were as normal as ever, as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear the news because I was watching the Olympics and seeing how Michael Phelps had earned two more medals."
At the beginning of 2014, Altamira Square, located in the eastern part of Caracas, was the focus of violent riots in protest against Maduro’s regime.
Now, however, not all the people of the country show the same enthusiasm when more pressure is needed from the opposition than ever before to facilitate the referendum this year.
Dejan said, "I want a referendum, but I won't protest for security reasons."
Others who are wiser are willing to mobilize in the future, but admit that the Venezuelans are not motivated enough.
The comments of the Chairman of the Electoral Commission, Tibese Roussena, attest to the fact that the Government is obstructing the recall process.
The 60-year-old Robert Toreyes told Fox Latin News: "I'll join the protest as long as the opposition calls for it, but I know some of my friends are afraid."
So, in addition to the many obstacles the Government has put in the way of delaying the referendum, the opposition now faces another challenge: mobilizing people to protest on the streets.
Until recently, there was considerable support for the referendum initiative, with unprecedented numbers mobilized during the signature collection phase.
However, when protesting the Government's exercise to block this effort, the crowds appear to be small.
Opposition MP Sipuriano Eredia said: "Some people are focused on food production, while others are afraid of multiple arrests and deaths in 2014. "
Following the announcement by Lucena that the next step in the referendum process (i.e. the collection of additional signatures nationwide) would have to wait until October, the opponents of the country ' s socialist Government declared that President Maduro and his followers were trying to crush the will of the Venezuelans and convince them that it was almost impossible to hold a vote this year.
According to the Constitution, if a referendum were to be held in 2017, Maduro might be forced to leave his post, but he would be allowed to appoint a successor.
However, if he was removed this year, he would have to ask for a general election.
The United States Department of State referred to this issue in a statement on Thursday afternoon, calling on the Venezuelan authorities to ensure that the Venezuelan people exercise their constitutional rights ...
The statement states: "The remaining steps to achieve the presidential referendum on recall need to be clear, concrete and implemented without delay, thus contributing to a speedy and effective solution to the current political, economic and social problems in Venezuela. "
Luis Salamanca, a political analyst who had served on the Electoral Commission from 2006 to 2009, said that changes could not take place soon.
He told Fox Latin that "I don't think there will be a referendum this year unless there is much larger social unrest and protest."
In his view, Lucena and the Government were breaking the law, but as long as the people did not protest strongly enough, they might finally achieve their purpose.
The opposition has called for a major rally in Caracas on 1 September to speed up the process so that the ballot can be called off this year.
On that day, we wanted people from all over the country to come to the capital city to mobilize.
"The government will feel the pressure," Eredia said.
But Salamanca believes that the situation can't wait that long.
The expert told Fox Latin that "they should respond more quickly and strongly to Lucena's announcement, which actually wiped out the referendum."
Congressman Eredia acknowledged that some parties within the opposition were eager to facilitate the rally as soon as possible, but others wanted more time to organize it.
Now the opposition must be careful.
Salamanca says, "If people are discouraged by the situation, there is a risk that the number of participants in the second round of signatures will be reduced."
The referendum process must be supported by 20% of the country’s electorate, or nearly 4 million people, in order to be effectively activated.
Salamanca and other analysts believe that Chavezism will be frustrated even if the recall takes place in 2017.
But some people aren't so optimistic.
Our party wants political change this year.
Eredia told Fox Latin that "If the government shuts down this election path, we will have to explore other legitimate options."
19: West Bromovich Team for the 2016-17 season
The Guardian journalists are expected to rank 14th. (Note: This is not necessarily Alan Smith's prediction, but the opinion of most journalists in this newspaper.)
It was 14th in the last season.
The award rate for winning the League championship (by Oddschecker) was 1,000-1
The new season, as usual, until last week, the Sibramovich team looked the same: the 2016-17 season could be another comfortable or stagnant season, led by Tony Price, who was always pragmatic, depending on the degree of humility and caution.
However, as Jeremy Pierce sold 88 per cent of his stake in the club to Price, who was known as a safe hand, the team became the favourite of the lottery company in a market where the commander was often fired like a squid.
There has been a definite change in the situation in the Black Country, not only in the mountain court, but also in a few miles northwest of Woolf Hampton, where the new East family from China did not hesitate to remove Kenny Jackiet.
Mr. Raul's concerns were dispelled and the entrepreneur declared that he wanted to maintain the club's culture.
In taking over the club, Mr. Ryan said, "I don't want to change the quality of the club, nor do I want to make unsustainable swings."
I want to be a good Easter and make a long-term investment in this club.
First, our goal is to make sure that we stay in the British Super Bowl, and then, on this basis, I want the club to be in the top half.
I believe this is the best football league in the world, and I want to lead this club as far away as possible.
According to Price's records, the first aspect should not be a problem.
The next target is the first half of the list, but for the new Easters and the increasingly divided fans who are looking to move up rapidly, it is important to realize that this is also an increasingly demanding task, as other teams in the ranks have recently been catching up.
More than half the team, based on the number 14 finals of the last season, must have done more than step up the rankings.
Only the bottom team of Astonville has fewer hits than they did, and it is worth mentioning that during Christmas, the West Bromovich team shot less than once per 90 minutes, once the worst-performing team in the area.
They won 13 out of 38 games with no score, and they only scored more than one in 9 games.
Of the 10 winnings, they didn't lead more than a ball once, and seven won at 1-0.
As expected, out of a total of 34 rare entry balls, a dozen are coming out of the locator ball.
It's no wonder there's a regular reaction of discontent at the mountain court, probably the most striking of which was the bad performance of the Astonville team at the end of January, which looked even worse.
On the other hand, only the first six teams have better defense records, but none of the other clubs can argue to keep four mid-level guards on a regular basis.
Backguards are often underestimated, especially Johnny Evans, who is said to have been invited by the Arsenal Club after the recent casualty crisis.
The foot of the Northern Ireland has performed well in the European championships, and there are no large transfers, and the Fesse Bromovich Club will not let people go.
Ben Foster's goal is solid. They're in good middle.
Similar to Evans, Darren Fletcher has a lot of evidence that he still has a high level of competition when he is 32, while Claudio Jacob is underestimated.
It's disturbing to all that the long and twisted story of the future of Cedo Bellasino is not over.
When Pis was running the club, both Stokes and Crystal Palace offers to Mark Hughes were rejected, although Stokes was still passionate and Mark Hughes was happy to wait.
After the end of the last season, all the parties concerned should take action as a matter of course.
There's no doubt that this front is talented, and as Price has mentioned many times, people have fought against him, but it's already clear that relationships alone do not get him.
The Sibramovich Club insisted on signing a replacement player to release the former English foot under 21 years of age, but their plan to invite Diyafra Sakoga League with Pound15 million broke down a few days before the transfer, stating that he had passed a medical examination and that everything was in order, but he suffered a back injury, which meant that he would miss the start of the season.
This put a lot of pressure on Venezuelan player Solomon Longton, who had some brilliant performances in the last season but needed to build on nine hits, especially in the light of Ricky Lambert's continuing poor state of health.
In retrospect, the decision to let Victor Anichebe and Stefan Sesenion go was a little out of the question.
The slowness of young players in their careers is notorious, and it is unlikely that three young players (Jonason Lecco, Sam Fields and Taylor Roberts) who entered their field of view in the last game of the 1-1 match last season will become normal.
He's going to look back for those who have been tested and tested, but Leco does deserve attention.
The 17-year-old attack guard, who appeared five times in the last season, was the first 1999-born player in the British Superballs and was highly valued in the British Youth team.
The £5.5 million pass from the Queen's Park Tourist Football Club will bring speed to Matt Phillips, the only new player in the week-end tournament.
There is reason to believe that this could be a very busy window closing period.
Speaking of what needs to be strengthened, Price tells Star Express: "There's a need everywhere."
Every position you see.
Backfield players, midfield players and front field players, we're all going to have to strengthen.
Target's set. We know what we want.
It has been shown that gaining access to them is more difficult than expected, mainly because of uncertainty in the transfer process.
This season can be judged by their inaugural performance, starting in mid-October in the cities of Manchester, Liverpool, Totnam and Lester.
By that time, the pressure on Price will either be released or made more difficult.
And even Bellasino would probably find a new club. Who knows?
The trustees support pension reform, and the Tower Steel UK corporate aid agreement will be reached.
The pension trustee behind the Tower Steel British company indicated that the scheme might be restructured and would not enter the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), thereby increasing the likelihood of the company reaching an aid agreement.
The United Kingdom Iron and Steel Insurance Scheme, with a debt of Pound15 billion and a fiscal deficit of Pound700 million by certain indicators, is a serious obstacle to an aid agreement between the Tower and Steel UK and the Port Talbot Steel Factory in Wales.
After several meetings with the Secretary of Commerce and pension regulators, Tower Steel has become increasingly confident about the future of its British business.
The company plans to merge its European operations, including British companies, with the German consortium Tysonkamp.
However, the aid agreement is conditional on the need to restructure the UK steel pension scheme and the need for financial support from the government.
Alan Johnston, President of the Pension Trustee, said that the scheme could avoid falling into the Pension Protection Fund if the interests of workers were revised.
Although the programme is well funded compared to other programmes, reducing the deficit to Pound300 million on some indicators, the Tower Steel and the Tissenkamp Group are keen to keep the debt under control.
Johnston said that the trustee admitted that it would be "unreal" for any buyer of the joint venture or of the Tower Steel British company to pay for the current and future deficit.
He added that the modification of the planned welfare arrangements was a more attractive option than the inclusion of the Pension Protection Fund, which reduced the treatment of workers.
Tata steel sources warned that the company might still sell the port of Talbot factory.
Since March, when negotiations began on future arrangements for British companies, the company has refused to provide guarantees for the future of those steel plants, which have been used as a bargaining chip with the British government.
The executive director of Tata Steel Europe, Kushko Chatgi, said that the Indian consortium wanted to make its steel business "more sustainable".
Chatgi, speaking on the sidelines of the Tata Steel India Annual Conference, said that negotiations were progressing on the restructuring of the pension scheme, but he insisted that it was well funded.
According to the Indian Times, "We are discussing with various stakeholders, including the British Government and others such as the Welsh Government."
There is a consensus that pensions have a certain impact on commodity businesses such as the steel industry, so we have to seek a structural solution that does not affect the further development of the enterprise.
The pension trustee agreed to cooperate in the negotiations on the restructuring of the programme, which would be welcomed by the tower steel.
Possible changes in the programme include measuring annual inflation-related increases in benefits through retail price indices up to the lower consumer price indices, and limiting future increases in pension payments to the minimum required by law ...
Johnston added: "The trustee and his advisers are the Tower Steel, and the Government and pension regulators have provided strong evidence that the programme will be able to pay the modified benefits indefinitely and achieve low risk beyond the Pension Protection Fund."
Our investment strategy means that the financial position of the programme is not as affected by the recent decline in the rate of return on public debt as many other British pension schemes have, and we believe that the programme can provide modified benefits on a self-sufficient basis, as it has been designed.
The price of corn, wheat and soybean at the Chicago Futures Exchange went up and down on 11th.
Market analysts argue that the price of maize has fallen due to a reduction in the volume of market transactions, while the increase in overseas imports of American soybeans has driven the price of soybean seasons to rise.

The case was presided over by the President of the Provincial High People ' s Court, Li Jing, and the Attorney-General of the Provincial People ' s Procuratorate, Wang, appeared in court to support the prosecution.
It is understood that this is the first time since the reform of the provincial justice system and the establishment of the "two houses" of the province, that the President of the Provincial High People's Court and the Prosecutor-General of the Provincial People's Procuratorate have been brought before the courts to perform their functions in accordance with the law.
Prior to the opening of the session, Jing Li examined the case file, wrote the transcript and directed the Full Court to develop the outline and programme of the trial.
Wang Jin examined the original case file in accordance with the law, questioned Huang Po, listened to the defence, collected additional evidence and prepared a pre-trial.
In view of the gravity of the case, it is legally necessary to refer it to the Trial Committee for a decision, and the case will be sentenced at a different date.
This trial is known to be an important step in my efforts to further improve the staffing system, judicial accountability and trial-centred reform of the litigation system, to implement the Director-General and the Attorney-General ' s lead case requests.

In the last six years, trust size has grown at an average annual rate of 52.89 per cent, covering such areas as funds, insurance, trusts, banking, pensions, cross-border investments, social goods, transaction payments, etc.
According to the Head of the Secretariat of the China Banking Association, Huang Yuen, asset hosting has become an important link between the currency market, capital markets and the real economy, and an important institutional arrangement to guarantee financial security.
With the rapid development of our direct financing and wealth management markets, the market position of asset hosting has increased.
Data from China's Asset Trust Industry Development Report (2016) show that, by the end of 2015, the country had a total of 62.74 per cent in Tobi, compared to 17.11 per cent at the end of 2011.
Tobi is the share of trust assets in the total deposits of financial institutions and is usually used to measure the position and role of the trust industry.
It is worth noting that, at present, our asset hosting mechanism is inadequate, and in many areas it is not strictly enforced or even included.
The absence of asset hosting mechanisms is an important reason for the emergence of P2P network lending, risk incidents in areas such as private equity funds.
The report recommends that an enterprise-wide, asset-wide, process-wide "all-trust" model be achieved as soon as possible to better safeguard financial security and safeguard investors' interests.
Each P2P platform is now required to draw up a substantial risk reserve, which cannot be set off as an asset.

" Under the prevailing winds of industrial run-off, the P2P platform extracts huge risk reserves, undoubtedly an important means of stabilizing investors ' minds ... "
Shenzhen co-chair of the Fiscal Services Agency, Hu Mu Peng, said that it was a very important tax to pay value added tax if it was not paid as a risk reserve for the enterprise itself.
" But if such a product is established by the insurance company in consultation with the insurance company and purchased by the P2P platform, it can be used for VAT credits and the cost of the enterprise will be reduced... "
He suggested that Shenzhen, as a pilot city for Internet finance, could be a forward-looking attempt by industry associations in consultation with insurance companies.
There is a new story in the A share market: the big deal weighs 3,000 points in the air, and behind this is the fact that the mood on the other side is still subdued, while foreign investment buys A shares for seven months in a row.
"I don't have enough confidence in what's going on over 3,000, and I'm still afraid of expanding the new stock."
The core change in the market is that after extraordinary volatility in 2015, the A share market entered the concussion market, and many events are pending, and the overall market financing continues to be weak and it is very difficult to make money.
The Gwang-bang Securities Report states that overall, personal investor sentiment remained subdued in July, and additional individual funding continued to decline.
In July, the balance of securities market transactions settlement funds decreased significantly from June, with a net change in the transfer of silver certificates amounting to $666.6 billion.

The net inflows of foreign capital, such as equity flows, continued with a net inflows of $8.7 billion in July and a larger net inflows than in the previous month.
The continuous FDI buy-in of A shares also indirectly suggests that the inherent attraction of the current A share market is increasing.

The investigation phase of the case by the public security organs, two former cooperation companies and the director of one of the companies, the joint development of the hotel company, and the signing of a letter of agreement between the parties on the issues involved in the case.
During the performance phase of the agreement, the two parties brought the other two before the court, requesting the court to confirm that the letter of agreement was null and void.
In recent days, the People ' s Court of the Hailar District of Hulenbel, Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia, ruled on the case.
Inner Mongolia, the City of Huronbel Central Real Estate Development Co. Ltd. developed a real estate project, the Hullenberg Tianren Hotel, in cooperation with China Qingzhou Federation (Beijing) Investment Ltd.
With the co-financing of the Chinese and Chinese Qing Hong Kong (Beijing) companies, Dong-Chung was the President and legal representative of the company.
The China Qing Hong Kong Federation (Beijing) Company, which agreed with Dong Tianlian Hotel after fulfilling its obligations under this agreement, applied to the public security authorities for the dismissal of the case and no longer held Dong and related persons legally liable.
After a good faith and full compliance with the agreement, the China-China Qing Hong Kong (Beijing) Company, Centurion Hotel Company, waived criminal liability and civil liability for the Sino-wei company, Dong-Chung and others.
This letter of agreement, signed on 24 April 2014, states that the Quartet reached agreement on the misappropriation and return of the misappropriation of funds by Dong-Jo and his subordinates.
The agreement includes, inter alia, the amount and time of the refund, the transfer of equity rights and the change of legal representation of the Company of the Twenty-First Century Hotel.
In October 2015, the parties to the agreement — Sino-wei and Dong-fung — brought the parties to the agreement — Sino-China Hong Kong (Beijing) and Centennial Hotel — before the court.
The defence responded that the public security organs conducted judicial audits, which resulted in the appropriation of over 29 million yuan in funds by Dong Jo and the accountants.
In February 2014, a Chinese company, Dong Qing Hongkong (Beijing), contacted him on his own initiative, signed a letter of agreement during negotiations in the conference room of the public security organs.
Dong-ho also pleaded guilty and repented and asked for an understanding, and returned $5 million in funds from the Centurion Hotel Company.
The plaintiff commissioned the representative to state that it was disputed whether the act of "lending" was a criminal act after Tung approached a legal person.
The letter of agreement was signed on the assumption that Dong-ho constituted misappropriation in violation of article 12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Criminal accountability and transfer of shares fall under different legal categories, not to be confused, not to trade, not to trade in shares for "exemption", and the Letter of Agreement is a legal cover for illegal purposes.
In the plaintiff ' s view, criminal liability is a State authority exercised by statutory organs of the State, such as the Public Prosecution Act, and is not governed by private agreements.
The agreement signed by the parties on 24 April 2014 violates the mandatory provisions of national laws and regulations and violates the public interest ...
Therefore, the agreement to waive criminal liability is null and void, regardless of whether or not Dong-Bing is guilty of a crime.
According to the defendant's representative, the nature of the letter of agreement was that the suspect and the victim had reached a civil understanding in the course of the criminal proceedings.
The letter of agreement was drawn up and implemented in order to maximize the financial loss of the victim and to enable the suspect to receive a lighter penalty, which is not an unlawful purpose and does not violate the mandatory provisions of the laws and regulations.
Signing a letter of agreement is the true meaning of Dong's letter, which is legally valid with the signature of the parties.
According to the defence, the crimes of "occupation of functions" and "misappropriation of funds" are among the public prosecution cases, and it is up to the public security authorities to decide whether or not to dismiss the cases, not the source.
The letter of agreement merely agreed that once Dong-Jo had fulfilled the agreement, the victim applied to the public security authorities for the dismissal of the case and did not conflict with the exercise of the public authority to prosecute.
At the same time, the court held that liability for breach of agreement went beyond liability for ordinary civil agreements; the validity of the agreement should be reviewed in criminal proceedings ...
Upon receipt of a warning, the Yang Quan City Public Security Bureau promptly and carefully prepared the emergency disposal plan and set up a disposal command, clarify the division of tasks, refine the working measures, implement the responsibilities and deploy fully.

James says the airline is "expected to recruit more pilots", and the government will have to raise the Air Force pilots' bonuses.
James and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, David Goldfin, want to improve the quality of life of pilots.
Goldfin wonders that the pilot's shortage is a crisis, and that the advantage of the air is not born in America, but acquired by battle.
Goldfin states that although the current shortage of pilots has not affected United States operations in Iraq, Syria and Libya, these operations have had an impact on pilots ' options.

Mr. Lin said Xiaoqiang also said that her foot had sprained two days ago and he didn't know how to break her bones.
There is a rule on the part of the park that minors must be accompanied by adult guardians and be fully responsible for their safety.

In this regard, counsel Chen Xiang of Hsien's law firm, Hsienbei, held that Xiaoqiang was responsible for the custody of the garden, whether or not he had broken the other person's bones.
It's a mistake to let Xiao Xiao enter the park without a guardian.

Precision, precision design and fine construction of drainage systems were carried out at the beginning of the construction of the Beijing Palace.
So the surface of the palace is adapted to the geographical characteristics of the Beijing region, and the overall movement is low north-south, medium-to-south and slightly sloped.
Of these, the North Gate's martial arts level is 46.05 metres high, the South Gate's midday level is 44.28 metres high and the North-South level is about 2 metres high. This slope creates favourable conditions for natural drainage and slow discharge.
And the system of drainage in the palace is so huge that the ancient gulls that have been retained to date are more than 15 kilometres long, with dark ditches of almost 13 kilometres long.
So all the drains within the palace go to the Inner Gold River, which is connected to the mound of the moorings 52 metres wide outside the walls of the palace, and to the surrounding offshore gold rivers, the Central South Sea and other water systems.
During successive inspections, the damage units were replaced in a timely manner by the staff of the Palace to ensure the flow of drainage during the rainy season.

The 760 metres long and complex construction process and the high technical requirements of the Beijing-Shangyang superhighway superhighway are the control works of the Beijing Shen Gao Liao Ning section.

Now that we have built solid dams with cement, when the flood arrives, we can move the coastal population more comfortably and reduce the loss of property ... "
Books, books, books are a hobby of my spare time, and in my study, the collection of magazine creations is an ever-expanding subject.
In the spring of 1992, Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave a south tour speech to push for a new round of reform and opening up to China, a magazine whose cover is a good reflection of the time.
The top of the cover is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic plan to move forward with reform, which shows a strong will and an unrefuted sense of greatness.
Below the cover is the Shenzhen Special Zone under construction in Xia, and the regular citizens are busy working.
My collection is the original issue of the two re-entrys after the founding of the country, and it reflects one side that Chinese workers have always been at the forefront of the times, contributing to social development and leading the way of the times.
The data show that at present, around 700,000 visits per year are made to the Kwank and, according to professional statistical analysis, 800,000 visits per year are unlikely to be made by the Kwank, otherwise the resources and environment of the Zone will be compromised.

"Springs of summer and summer at the foot of the mountain, ice at the top of the autumn mountain, not enough oranges, and the worst summer and autumn winters are unique and typical climatic features of the Lord's farm.
As a result, the Farmer's Box does not overexploit, and the preservation of the ecological environment through sustainable tourism is well worth learning and learning from other world heritage sites.
It is our 50th world heritage, and China has become the world ' s second largest heritage country, and it wants 50 world heritage sites to be passed on forever and forever.
At present, many heritage sites have "restatement, conservation, exploitation, management" issues, and the world heritage has become "money-shaking trees".
It's obvious that if you look at the legacy purely in economic terms and treat it as a "gold job", then the future of a better one will be elusive.
In this regard, there is a history of forward-carrying, as in the case of the 2010 World Heritage Conference, in which six of China ' s world heritage sites were warned by yellow cards, mainly overexploitation leading to changes in the ecological environment of their sites.

The latest figures from the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees show that Germany received 240,000 refugees in the first seven months of this year, a significant reduction from the number expected.
In 2015, a large influx of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa entered Germany, registering more than a million refugees in Germany in that year.
Weizer, head of the German weekly Economics, quoted on 11th, reported that only 240,000 refugees have entered Germany so far this year, much less than expected.
Despite the decline in the number of refugees entering Germany, the Agency ' s task remains daunting, with some 500,000 asylum applications still pending.
Nevertheless, an increasing number of refugees have brought the Bureau before the courts, some of whom have been waiting for more than two years.
By the end of 2015, the refugee case against the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees was close to 2300.
According to the Central Bank of Russia, the main reason for growth is the re-evaluation of the expectations of the Russian economy by the market.
Russian international reserves include foreign exchange reserves, gold reserves, reserve positions at the International Monetary Fund and special drawing rights.
Russian international reserves are controlled jointly by the Russian Government and the Central Bank, mainly in response to economic risks.
In recent years, the Russian economy has been under downward pressure and international reserves have been declining as a result of Western sanctions against Russia and the fall in international oil prices.
In recent years, a big Hollywood film can be said to be a well-deserved protagonist in the film market, which is usually well-produced, crowds of nebula and propaganda for the offensive, as if everyone were talking about it and going to the cinema to find out.
So, do these big pieces really come as we thought they were, roll a piece of money and go back?
Needless to say, the cost of production of a large Hollywood film is rising every year, much higher than the rate of inflation.
According to the data in figure 1, over a decade from 1995 to 2004, 60 Hollywood films were produced at a cost of over $100 million.
However, in the next 11 years from 2005 to 2015, the number has increased to 197.
The surge in the number of high-productions means that the average cost of film production has risen, which has also raised industry alarm.
Prominent directors Spielberg and Lucas have criticized this phenomenon at a forum event: if this continues, the industry will be "intocendiary."
Of the 29 films, marketing costs represented the highest 40 per cent of total costs and the lowest 24 per cent.
Physical copying, production of audio-visual products and their transportation costs averaged $67.8 million.
It is important to properly estimate the number of copies and audio-visual products required, especially in the DVD market, where "refundable" sales policies have been adopted.
In 2005, the dream factory produced 5 million sets of "Monster Shrek 2" DVDs, but their sales were so low that their income targets for the season were not met.
The 29 films will also spend an average of $36.6 million on income-sharing and compensation, mostly by key creators such as directors, producers, screenwriters, starring, etc.
For the Hollywood studio, the revenue-sharing mechanism can help reduce the financial pressure of the prior period; for the founder, it is also an incentive.
Of the 29 films, an average of 9 per cent of the profit-making film was allocated to the share, the highest of which was 18 per cent, and even the lost film had an average of about 5 per cent to the share.
It's worth noting that the creators will require a "income share" rather than a "profit share".
It's because some of the big movies could be in a state of loss because of the workings of a sophisticated Hollywood accounting system.
For example, in 2010, a report leaked by Harry Potter 5 showed that two years after the film was released, Warner still claimed that he had lost $167 million, making the profit split a dead letter.
Hollywood also needs to pay a certain dividend to an association of all categories of staff, and the 29 films paid an average of $11.76 million.
In addition, the operating costs of Hollywood Film Corporation will be shared among the various ministries, with an average of $14.83 million for the 29 films.
After deducting sales taxes and the division of cinemas, the party could receive 53 per cent of the North American and 41 per cent of the international fares, with revenues estimated at $169 million.
After deducting an average of $98 million in marketing costs for cinema distribution, there's only about $70 million left.
With regard to audio-visual distribution in the home, the 29 films received an average of $134.3 million in income.
After eliminating an average of $21.9 million in marketing costs and $30.5 million in production costs, the average net gain was $81.9 million, the highest income, and the profit margin was much higher than that of the cinema.
The revenue generated by the paid television channel for these films is slightly higher than the free channel, which averages $14.6 million for the former and $13.3 million for the latter.
About half of the 29 films received less than 1 per cent of the income from video spots, and only 4.1 per cent of the income from films issued after 2011.
Hollywood still has a more conservative attitude to video on-demand as it constructs the distribution systems of these super-large pieces.
With respect to derivative development, the 29 films generated an average of $11.5 million by authorizing derivative development.
But there's almost two thirds of the revenue from derivative development from the top two megafilms, and only one third of the films make more than $1 million.
In addition to the above-mentioned sources of revenue, these Hollywood films also have fragmented revenues from aircasts, music, etc., with an average of not more than $2.7 million.
Surprisingly, according to Stephen, the average profit for the 29 Hollywood films was $14.8 million, with a profit rate of 3.7 per cent.
And given the long income recovery process, this profit margin is likely to be difficult to defeat inflation.
At the lowest cost of 100-125 million dollars, the film was the least profitable, with only one third of the money.
And three quarters of the films at the highest cost (over $200 million) are profitable.

According to the Japanese media, Foreign Minister Shishida of Japan had begun his visit to the Philippines on 11 August and had talks with the President of the country, Mr. Dutelt, to strengthen bilateral cooperation.
Japan and the United States are eager to approach the Philippines in terms of economic cooperation, with the intention of preventing the Philippines from turning to China.
On 11 August, Japan's Economic News website reported that Shimada would meet with Dutelt in Davao City, Southern Philippines, and with the Foreign Minister of the Philippines, Asai, the first time that members of the Japanese Cabinet had met with Dutelt.
Landa made a special trip to Davao City, instead of Manila, the capital of Dutelt, in the hope of early confirmation of cooperation with the Philippines on the South China Sea issue.
In late July, after participating in a related ASEAN meeting in Laos, a meeting was held in Manila with Dutelt, where the parties agreed to respect the South China Sea arbitral award.
"In any consultation, the arbitral award will be the basis."
At that time, Cree indicated that it would provide $32 million in assistance to the Government of the Philippines, and it was also highly likely that at the 11th meeting, Ashida would once again demonstrate assistance for, inter alia, the construction of the Manila North-South commuter railway.
According to the report, the rush of Japan to approach Dutelt is due to the fact that the Philippines is stepping up bilateral consultations with China.
Reports indicate that the United States and Japan have continued to strengthen their cooperation with the Philippines, and that the new military agreement signed by the USF in 2014 allows the US Army to be de facto based in the Philippines for another 25 years.

There is no doubt that cultural self-confidence is raised at this time on the basis of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people ' s full recognition of their cultural values and firm confidence in their vitality.
Many have found that in Xi Jinping's series of speeches, articles, speeches, interviews, Chinese ancient classics, classic phrases that swath out, have highlighted a high degree of cultural self-confidence and generated widespread resonance throughout the world.
The rise of contemporary China has proved to be accompanied by a growing appeal for the influence of Chinese culture.
China's nearly modern history over 100 years ago has shown us that the path, the theory and the system are rooted in culture.
We've been thinking about Western learning instruments, systems and cultures, and in the process we've been thinking.
After a long exploration, we found that China's firm confidence in modernization is rooted in the spiritual genes of the Chinese nation.
In Xi Jinping's speeches and interviews, there are countless accounts of Chinese traditional cultures of excellence, including Confucian thought.
During the eighteenth collective study of the Central Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping emphasized that China had developed from yesterday and the day before yesterday.
He also said that for thousands of years, the Chinese nation had followed a path of civilized development that was different from that of other nations and nations.
It's not a coincidence that we opened the path of Chinese socialism, it's determined by our historical heritage and cultural traditions.
In 2010, China officially made the second-largest GDP in the world, but it was more than an economic achievement.
Since the 18th year of the Chinese Communist Party, China has placed the building of a socialist cultural power in a more prominent position and is committed to creating a new "gold age" for cultural development.
Both good traditional, revolutionary and socialist advanced cultures exhibit unprecedented vitality.
Although Chinese culture has a very long history and very strong momentum, it is undeniable that its immediate impact and impact are far from being as high as it should be.
Although China has experienced a lost time in the last few centuries, it has now returned to the world stage and in a more powerful way ... "
In an interview with the press, the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey, Mohammed Simsek, said that Chinese culture had contributed much to the world.
As Simsek said, China today is contributing to the world in a completely new way.

The law, known as "Kim Angland Law", which is the strongest anti-corruption law in Korean history, requires public officials to accept a meal at a cost not exceeding 30,000 won (approximately 181 yuan) per person next month.
HAN reported on the 10th day that this provision has challenged many Korean high-end restaurants that used to cater exclusively to politicians and senior civil servants.
A lot of restaurants adjust their rates and introduce cheaper packages, and some just close and change their lines.
HAN reported that the owners of many Korean restaurants are now grieving about their future performances due to "Kim Anglophone".
In Seoul, there are politicians, government officials, media journalists and businessmen at the "Sagawa" restaurant since its opening in 1969.
The owner of the hotel told the KUNA reporters that they had been proud to provide their customers with high-end food and private meals for years.
Over the past 10 years, hotels have been offering high-grade packages, but "to meet the ceiling on the cost of meals, we will be forced to change decades of tradition, which is a tough decision."
Charcoal Burning Village, which is dominated by beef roasting, and its Managing Director, Kim Keefu, says that the restaurant's branded dish, Han Bull, is worth over 50,000 won.

On August 12, the news spokesman for the National Statistical Office of China and China reported today that Liaoning's urban survey of unemployment figures was higher than the national average and that the internal pressure was greater due to the restructuring of its economy.
The Press Office of the State Council today held a press conference on the functioning of the national economy in July 2016.
In terms of the broader environment, the international economy is in deep adjustment, the recovery is slow, and there is considerable pressure on China ' s exports, including to Liaoning Province.
Domestically, China is in a critical period of structural adjustment, and the tension between the excess of traditional industries and the lack of growth of effective market demand is still greater, and the pain of the restructuring of traditional industries is being unleashed.
So this round of adjustment is precisely the depth of price adjustment for rechemical products, which inevitably puts downward pressure on the Liaoning economy.
During the 12th Five-Years period, the expansion of real estate has led to better infrastructure development in Liaoning and a higher real estate base.
After entering the 13th Five, this round of real estate adjustment, which was based on a relatively high base, dropped much more in terms of data performance than in other regions.
Hsing concluded that Liaoning ' s economic adjustment was a particular economic cause, both cyclical and structural, and base effects, generally in the adjustment process.
It was also reported that Liaoning's urban survey of unemployment figures was higher than the national average and that internal pressure was greater due to the restructuring of its economy.
According to data for the last two months, Liaoning's economy showed signs of stability, and the indicators were shrinking.
We are confident that the economy of the northeast, including Liaoning, will, with the combined efforts of all parties, recreate the winds of the old industrial base of Japan.

The decision was taken following talks between President Maduro of Venezuela and President Santos of Colombia.
According to BBC reports, it was agreed that the first phase would open up the entry and exit of five entry points for pedestrians along the border between the two countries.

Proponents believe that the new constitution will heal the tear of the Thai nation and contribute to its stability.
The opponents believe it's an unfair referendum that, once passed, will give the military more power.

After the motor three-wheeler stopped slowly, the traffic officer checked it out and found a total of 11 people in the car, plus a total of 12 motor three-wheel drivers.
When the driver got out of the car, he said repeatedly that the brakes were not working, that the civilian police came up and found that the brakes on the car were really not working, that the civilian police criticized the driver ' s behaviour and seized the motor three-wheeler.
The civilian police were informed, upon enquiry, that the 12 persons in the vehicle were workers at the site and that the driver knew that the brakes were not working, that the workers were being taken to and from work, that there was a high risk of travelling on the road and that in case of an emergency there was a high risk of casualties.
The 7th Chinese-Russian Cultural Monument opened in the evening of the 12th day in Black River City, China.
This year's Chinese-Russian cultural gathering will set the stage for the two countries to promote their cultural industries, their economic trade, their union, and their development.
2016 marks the fifteenth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty on Good-Neighbourly Relations and Cooperation between China and Russia and the twentieth anniversary of the strategic partnership between China and Russia.
Under China's vision of "a way forward" the Governments of China and Russia have been able to cooperate extensively in various fields, using the Chinese and Russian cultural collection as a platform.
As a large cross-border trade in Chinese and Russian culture, exchanges and exchanges, the Chinese and Russian cultural collection is a platform for sharing the fruits of economic development, cultural prosperity and the promotion of friendship and cooperation among the Chinese and Russian people.
As an important vehicle for the exchange of friendly cultures between China and Russia, the Chinese and Russian cultural collection has successfully held six sessions since 2010.
The Deputy Mayor of the Black River, Van Chik, told reporters that in the history of Black River development, trade and culture always go hand in hand.
In the current period of concentration of Chinese and Russian culture, on the basis of an exchange of visits between the two countries ' official high-level and cultural and artistic groups, we have invited foreign nationals from China to the Black River to conduct trade exchanges to promote trade and economic development on both sides of China and Russia.
Van Chik said that the Chinese-Russian Cultural Fair provided us with a stage where culture and trade could flourish.
China will build on its strengths at the beginning of the Cultural Industries Improvement Project, which will create platforms for Russian cultural industries, develop cultural industries projects and integrate geographical cultural resources.
The opening ceremony of the major cultural festivals, which were the focus of the attention of 400,000 people in China and Russia, was officially opened at 1930 hours on the same day.

In accordance with the relevant regulatory requirements, Yuenyu Yuji Province has set up two explicit excavation sections at the north and south ends to reduce the impact on the traffic, and the two sides have proceeded with the construction work at the wrong time.
Depending on the construction requirements, during the construction, the transport organization has adopted an organizational programme of "full-closed construction", which prohibits the movement of vehicles within the closed construction area and frees the traffic as soon as conditions are in place.
During the construction, the East-West route was proposed to the vehicles on the second round of the south road, on the dirt road, on the north side of the Yuzheng quarter, on the Jedda Road, on the horseback hill road, on the 10th route, on the north-south side of the vehicle route, on the swirling road, on the Yu Hing road, on the hero hill road, and so on.

In the town of Mlandizi, Kibach district, Tanzania Beach Province, Wang Tree from Hebei, China, is busy, and in October this year there will be a steel factory.
" Tanzania ' s annual steel demand has reached 1.83 million tons, but locally produced steel bars do not meet the requirements of high-rise buildings, bridges, and 70 per cent of the country ' s steel bars are imported ... "
The words of this entrepreneur, who has been working in the steel industry in China for many years, break Tanzania's great appeal to him, which is the vast market potential of the local community.
Like Wang Yusheng, more and more Chinese entrepreneurs turn their eyes to Africa in search of business opportunities.
At the end of July this year, the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Wang Yi, when attending the meeting of focal points for the implementation of the outcome of the summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing, stated that, compared to assistance, investment cooperation was becoming a new impetus for China-Africa cooperation.
According to the President of the Central African Development Fund, Ishi Qiyang, Africa is the new pole of global economic growth and the most dynamic region after East and South Asia.
Data from the Central African Development Fund show that trade in Central Africa exceeded $200 billion in 2014 and is expected to reach around $400 billion by 2020.
China ' s stock of non-direct investment in 2014 exceeded $30 billion, and by 2020 it will move to $100 billion.
The Executive Director of the African Economic Research Institute of Kenya, Lyma Senbert, said at the 12th Central African Media think tank seminar in Mombasa, Kenya, that China had become an important partner in transformational development in Africa.
Wang Yusheng acknowledged that there are enormous challenges to local integration in the organization of the plant, but he is optimistic about the prospects for future development.
The CBC commentator mistook Michael Phelps for Ryan Rochett.
An Olympic critic at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's CBC ran into an awkward situation on Thursday night, confusing Michael Phelps with his opponent, Ryan Rochett.
Elliot Friedman totally misjudged the two men during the 200-metre personal swim finals.
While Phelps was winning, Friedman thought of him as Rochette, a compatriot of Phelps and a long-time opponent of the World Swimming Competition.
Friedman shouted, "In the end, he's gonna win!"
Ryan Rochett will defeat Michael Phelps in this game!
Phelps may not even be able to go to the podium.
But it was Phelps who won, and Rochett only got fourth.
The moment Phelps touched the gold medal, the CBC broadcast went silent.
Friedman immediately admitted his mistake, which was admirable.
I apologize. I confused the track.
"It was Phelps who got the gold medal," he said.
The Canadian commentator was widely praised for his professionalism after the misbroadcast, and in the hours after the race, he confessed his mistakes again and apologized on Twitter to the audience.
I'm sorry, everyone.
I screwed up.
"There's no excuse," he wrote.
Meanwhile, with this victory, Phelps broke a record of 2168 and became the most successful person in history in the Olympics of personal projects.
The former record keeper was Leonidas of Rhodes Island, believed to have won the highest Olympics in the ancient Olympic Games.
The future will be easier to find parking places in the happiest place in the world.
Disneyland has released detailed plans for the construction of an expected parking building, a traffic centre and a new footbridge in the east of the thematic park resort area.
The project, which is located in the eastern part of the resort area near Highway 5, includes a parking building with 6,800 parking spaces and a traffic centre where tourists from the park can take buses, commuters, taxis and other vehicles.
A footbridge will be erected on Port Bay Boulevard to connect the resort area, parking building and traffic centre.
The parking building, as well as the ongoing work on the expansion of the 14 acres of planetary battlefield, is part of the $1 billion investment promised by the city of Anaheim in exchange for a 30-year entertainment tax exemption.
This project, known as the East Gate, will begin next year.
The parking building will be built on the Pompey parking lot in Disneyland, which has 1,300 parking spaces.
The traffic centre will be built at the site of a commercial property purchased in 2014 in the thematic park.
The whole project is expected to be operational in 2018.
Ms. Susie Brown, Disneyland spokesman, said: "The East Gate Project is part of our major investment in Anaheim City and as we continue to expand the size of the Disneyland resort, it will provide more parking spaces for tourists and help ease congestion in the resort area."
Four people died as a result of a bomb explosion in a tourist attraction in Thailand.
After voters voted for a new constitution supported by the military government, a series of bombings targeting tourist hotspot destinations occurred in five southern provinces of Thailand on Thursday and Friday, resulting in four deaths and many injuries.
On Thursday night, two explosions hit the beach resort in Hua Xin, followed by another explosion on Friday morning.
The town is about 200 km south of Bangkok.
According to the police, the first explosion killed a Thai woman and injured 20, 10 of whom were of foreign nationality.
Authorities have confirmed that the southern cities of Phuket, Dongli and Wanren have also had multiple bombing attacks.
Two bomb explosions occurred in Baton Town in Puji, and two explosions occurred in the Tulip Centre in the tourist area near the northern city of Phuket.
In the last 24 hours, there have been 11 bomb explosions in Thailand.
Colonel Quesana Patanacharoun, Royal Thai Police Officer, said on Friday that the bombings had nothing to do with Islamic extremism but with deliberate acts of destruction on the ground.
He said, "It's too early to rush a conclusion."
But we are convinced that these events are not directly related to any type of terrorism, that they are, in fact, deliberate acts of destruction on the ground and that we are trying to identify those responsible.
Following a small bomb explosion in Huaying on 12 August 2016, the investigating officer collected evidence of the crime scene.
On 12 August, officials indicated that a series of bomb attacks against a vital tourist industry in Thailand had resulted in the deaths of four people and that the authorities were busy identifying the motive for the incident and finding the perpetrators.
There is no conflict in Thailand that could lead to the emergence of terrorists on the ground.
"So we can say these events are not terrorist attacks," he added.
No organization has claimed responsibility for the attack and no specific group has been accused by the authorities, although the bombings took place in the same week as the Thai electorate voted for the adoption of the new constitution.
The three southern provinces where Pushi and Tudor are located are opposed to a referendum supported by the military government, and the Muslim majority in the south-eastern provinces of Thailand have been rebelled since 2004 and have resulted in the deaths of more than 6,500 people.
These bombings took place on the birthday of Queen Sirikit of Thailand and on a public holiday in the country.
Hwa Xin is the seat of the palace where the King of Thailand often sits.
King Pumipo Adude is the longest-serving monarch in the world.
Signals on Ukraine: What is Vladimir Putin doing?
It's hard to judge what these claims are.
Ukraine denied it, while the United States and the European Union indicated that Russia had not provided any evidence.
The Digital Evidence Research Laboratory (an open source analysis organization) found signs of an exchange of fire on Saturday, but Moscow's exaggeration was hardly justified.
Russia’s distortion or misrepresentation of events for political purposes is well known, especially in the fog of ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
That doesn't mean that Russia's claims are hypocritical.
Last year, Ukrainian civilian forces destroyed power transmission towers for Crimea, some of whom were also involved in criminal offences and human rights violations.
An attempted attack in Crimea was not impossible, although there was little reason to suspect that the Ukrainian Government would support such a conspiracy.
Whatever happened, the images found by the open source analyst showed that the Russian military presence in Crimea had been escalating since at least Saturday (before the so-called attack).
These images show the movement of heavy weapons escorts on the peninsula, including coastal defence missile systems.
I'm familiar with a disturbing Russian escalation.
A number of reports indicate that the Russian army in Crimea has long planned a new rotation at this stage, which would help to explain the activities, although by coincidence this coincides with the most tense period since the seizure in 2014.
Whatever happens this weekend, Mr. Putin ' s statement to Ukraine has undoubtedly escalated and has chosen to use this episode, whatever its trueness, to achieve some greater purpose.
Analysts point out that this is a disturbing parallel to the previous Russian military action against Ukraine.
In February 2014, similar rhetoric and military exercises provided cover for the seizure of the peninsula by the Crimean volunteer militia, while the Crimean peninsula remained under Ukrainian control, which only showed that the militias were in fact special forces of the Russian military occupation.
In August of that year, with the fall of Russian-backed separatists in Eastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin stationed his troops along the border, warning of the possible need to "protect" Russian civilians in Ukraine, who he said were being attacked.
He planned an aid escort to enter the area, but NATO claimed it was merely to cover up the Russian invading army.
What exactly did Mr. Putin plan in Crimea?
Some would like to know if Moscow was planning another intervention.
The fighting in Eastern Ukraine has escalated, as it was before the invasion in August 2014.
However, this seemingly similarity may be the focus, which is intended to create fear of military action rather than action, which will give Mr. Putin considerable leverage in his games with Ukraine and Western countries.
Mark Galeorti, Professor of Russian Affairs at the University of New York, pointed out that it was pointless for Crimea to be used as a assembly area for military operations against Eastern Ukraine, which was bordering the Russian mainland rather than Crimea, and that other parts of the country were better defended.
Mr. Galeorti said, "The Russians can't really plan some kind of major offensive."
Instead, "What we see is the Russian classic strategy of creating tension."
Mr. Putin ' s mechanism of international peace talks on Ukraine, which forced his Western leaders to avoid contact with him because of Russia ' s annexation of Crimea, has become increasingly futile.
By taking advantage of the pending threat of new conflict, Mr. Putin offered a new rationale for such talks: to persuade him to stand on the cliff.
Referring to the next peace talks planned for early September, Mr. Galeorti said: "This is a standard Putin tactic, and he wants to take a preponderant position before participating in the talks. "
The only real advantage is to say, "I can make things worse if I want to."
The position of bargaining with the West.
Mr. Putin also said this week that it was pointless to continue negotiations during periods of tension in Crimea, forcing other parties to persuade him to return to the negotiating table, thereby placing himself at the centre of this process.
What does he actually get by doing that?
First, it allows Russia to continue to claim that it is a world power, even if its enemies are smaller than Australia.
Secondly, it gives Moscow the status of veto power over Ukraine ' s sovereignty and puts the country under a certain degree of Russian control.
It also serves Mr. Putin ' s long-held desire to make a big deal with the United States to resolve the dispute between the two sides over Ukraine and Syria on conditions favourable to Moscow and to end Western sanctions against Russia.
Since the collapse of Russia ' s enemies in late 2014, Mr. Putin has repeatedly suggested this objective, largely due to the decline in the value of Russian oil and gas exports.
Since his involvement in Syria last fall, he has repeatedly invited the Western Powers to join him as a great alliance against extremists.
However, Russian leaders may think that they need to ensure such a deal before President Obama leaves office in January.
Russian officials tend to view Hillary Clinton as a possible successor and more hostile to Moscow.
Donald Trump, although apparently friendly to Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
Mr. Galeorti said, however, that Mr. Obama was considered to be "the man who seeks a solution, not a conflict".
So there's a feeling that the window of opportunity is closing and that something needs to be done quickly.
At the same time, without any major deal, Mr. Putin is happy to let Russia's vulnerable neighbours guess what's going to happen.
The earlier version of the paper was wrong about the year when Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea.
In fact, it should be 2014 instead of 2013.
There's a deadlock in Congress, and the White House has released funds to fight against the card.
The Obama administration indicated on Thursday that it was releasing $81 million from biomedical research and anti-poverty and health-care programmes for the development of a vaccine against the virus, a non-conventional measure because Congress had not approved the new funding needed to deal with the virus.
In a letter to Congressman, the United States Secretary of Health and Public Service, Silvia Matthews Powell, stated that, without the money released, the National Institute of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Administration would have spent the funds allocated at the end of the month to deal with this mosquito-borne disease.
At a time when the number of local cases in Miami has increased, vaccine development has been forced to stop at a critical stage due to lack of funding.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of last week, there had been 7,350 card cases in the United States, most of them in Puerto Rico.
Ms. Povell said that 15 babies had been born with a birth card virus with birth defects.
This virus can cause brain development disorders and other serious defects in the children born to infected pregnant women.
The first cases of the spread of the disease on the mainland of the United States had emerged at the end of last month, and the political leverage surrounding the federal government ' s response had increased accordingly.
Hilary Clinton ran a campaign in Winwood on Tuesday, a town bordering Miami with a series of locally transmitted card cases that forced Congress to suspend its five-week recess in order to pass emergency allocations against the virus.
President Obama and the Republicans of Congress have been disconcerting for most of this year on the issue of HCV.
In February, Mr. Obama requested an emergency allocation of $1.9 billion.
The Republicans rejected the request and requested more detailed accounts on the whereabouts of the funds.
For months, parliamentarians have been arguing about how much money should be earmarked.
Last month, the Democratic Party vetoed a proposal by the Republican Party to allocate $1.1 billion to combat cards with provisions prohibiting the financing of HIV-related contraception by family planning associations, which can be sexually transmitted.
This impasse prompted the White House to release $589 million in April from Ebola research funding for the fight against the virus, about two thirds of which was earmarked for use in the United States.
On Thursday, Ms. Povell said that her department had already spent most of that money and would have run out by the end of August.
Ms. Powell wrote: "As the emergency additional funding for the response to the virus failed to be approved, the Government was forced to choose between delaying the development of critical vaccines and diverting funds from other valuable government projects to avoid delays for the time being."
The Democrats used the announcement to accuse the Republicans of failing to provide additional funds to fight the virus.
At the press conference, the California House of Representatives, minority leader Nancy Pelosi, called on the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, to put Congress back on track to move such measures forward.
Ms. Pelosi said, "All possible options are exhausted, and now we're going to the National Institute of Health, which is a priority option."
Mr. Ryan's assistant said that releasing those funds was a long-delayed step by the Obama administration to extract as much political advantage as possible from the problem of the virus.
The National Institute of Health announced last week that it had started clinical trials for a card vaccine on 80 human subjects and was expected to begin a second test in the "Pocket Cable Pop countries" in early 2017.
However, since no more funds are available, officials have indicated that the study will stop on Thursday.
Ms. Poville said that she would transfer $34 million from funds earmarked by the National Institute of Health for the treatment of other diseases, such as cancer and diabetes, for research on the virus.
An additional $47 million will be allocated to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to support the development of medicines and vaccines in response to public health emergencies.
This money will come from various accounts, including $19 million transferred from a programme to provide heating oil subsidies to low-income families, and $4 million transferred from programmes to deal with drug abuse, such as opioid addiction.
Ms. Povell said that even then, these additional funds would have to last only the following month, when the research institutions against the virus would have to "reverse a lot of critical work" if Congress did not act again.
Over the past four months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have spent US$ 60 million on providing protection to pregnant women in the states, US$ 25 million on strengthening state preparedness and response plans for card outbreaks, and US$ 16 million on helping states to create data collection systems for rapid detection of all symptoms associated with small head malformations and other cards.
Thai leaders believe that attacks on tourist attractions are linked to a change of constitution
On Friday, the head of Thai military government urged the nationals to remain patient during the investigation to find behind the scenes of this week's series of deadly bombings in Thailand.
The head of the military Government and Prime Minister, General Bayo G. Jooch, suggested that the perpetrators were "some bad guys" who opposed the new constitution adopted by Thai voters in the national referendum on Sunday.
In his national address, he said, "There are still some bad guys who were working until the referendum began."
The bombings in five provinces on Thursday and Friday resulted in four deaths and dozens of injuries, including in the tourist resorts of Puji and Huaying.
According to the authorities, other arson attacks in Thailand also appear to be connected.
According to analysts, these bombings do not appear to be intended to kill many people, but rather to destroy tourism as one of the few economic bright spots in Thailand.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Wachin.
The Senior Researcher for Human Rights Watch, Sunai Pasouk, said: "Whatever the motive, these explosions and arson attacks have shaken the military government ' s claim that the situation will remain stable after the referendum."
These attacks have resulted in the stigmatization of the authorities, the intimidation of the public and the undermining of the tourism-based economy.
Photo of Thai rescue workers treating a victim injured in the Friday bombing.
According to the police, they do not consider these bombings to be related to international terrorism or to the long-standing Islamic rebellion in southern Thailand.
They described these attacks as "local sabotage" rather than terrorism.
The timing and location of these attacks have strong political symbolism.
The explosion occurred on the occasion of the celebration of the Queen Sirikit's birthday on Friday, which was also considered Mother's Day in Thailand.
Four bombs hit the royal town of Hua Xin, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where most of the wounded come from.
A constitution drafted by the military would weaken the influence of political parties and give greater authority to the military, even after the military placed the Government under civilian control.
The junta ensures its victory by preventing opponents from launching campaigns against them.
The South-East Asia expert at the Center for International Strategic Studies in Washington, D.C., Murray Hebrew, noted that the Thai military suspected that the perpetrators of these attacks were people who were unhappy with the vote.
He said that the bombs were clearly coordinated but clearly intended to create an atmosphere of terror and anxiety, not mass destruction and casualties.
Last year, a bomb blast in the Irawan shrine in Bangkok killed 20 people, most of them Chinese tourists.
Thai officials attributed the bomb explosion to the deportation of more than 100 Uighurs to China, which upset Uighurs militants.
General Bao has been leading the military group since a coup d ' état overthrew the democratically elected government in Thailand in 2014, saying that the bombing this week has caused the Thai people to be sad.
He said, "Why now, when the country's situation, the economy and tourism are improving?"
We have to ask who did it for what.
Winning response: How does Simon Manuel's history look?
And as I entered the game tonight, I kind of wanted to get rid of the black group that I had, and I took it to this position.
But I really want it to disappear.
What I'm so happy about is that I can inspire others and want to promote diversity in sports.
But at the same time, I want to one day not just black swimmer Simon, but more black people, because the title of black swimmer sounds like I wasn't supposed to be able to win gold medals or break records.
That's not true. I work as hard as anyone else, and I love this movement, and I want victory as anyone else.
Colombia's struggle to protect non-hetero-sex students
Two years ago, 16-year-old Sergio Arreg jumped out of a shopping mall in Bogotá, and his suicide note on Facebook quoted Pinkbye Cruel World.
His death was the beginning of a debate this week that has upset Colombia, as the struggle for greater rights for the LGBT community has been drawn into a broader political struggle that has plunged the country into a polar divide of views.
After Arrigg's death, his mother, Arva Reyes, sued the school officials for deliberately excluding her only son from the group after discovering her intimate relationship with a classmate.
A year later, the Supreme Court of Colombia issued a final ruling in support of her view calling for more explicit anti-discrimination policies in schools throughout the country.
The ruling was part of a series of legal victories achieved by the Colombian Gay Rights Movement, which was celebrated by Colombia earlier this year when it ruled that same-sex marriages were legalized.
This week, however, their struggle for equality, the Minister of Education and the public homosexual Gina Pejotti, became a flashpoint of scandal in the execution of the ruling.
A dispute broke out when the sexual exposure of a pornographic magazine began to circulate in social media and the distributor claimed it was part of the instruction manual issued by the Ministry of Education.
Ms. Perotti quickly revealed the lie.
Although the Ministry of Education has provided guidance to schools on issues relating to sexual orientation and gender identity to help them to take note of the decision, it has not sought to enforce standardized rules ...
In an interview on Thursday, Ms. Perjoti said, "What we want is that schools have the means to resolve conflicts."
In a national debate on the theme "The future of the country torn apart by the peace negotiations between the Government and the FARC (the guerrilla group)", the dispute opened a new front.
The coalition of politicians opposed to the Government and the leaders of the Catholic Church mobilized with extraordinary speed to accuse the Government of President Juan Manuel Santos of promoting same-sex unions and gender mobility.
In addition, a recent agreement on gender and LGBT equality between government delegations negotiating with FARC in Havana called for a more inclusive policy by the Government.
Those critical of the Government and the peace talks have been strongly critical of the aftermath of Colombian politics, with 42-year-old Ms. Pejorti.
They showed rude posters at the rally, and some threatened violence against her and her partner, former Minister of Commerce Cecilia Álvarez Correa Glenn.
During that unpleasant week, Ms. Pejordi was very patient and tried to clarify misunderstandings and re-establish constructive debate.
She said, "Some part of the reason I'm strong and sober is that I know that some of the kids are out there in the process of openly recognizing their sexual orientation."
It's a difficult phase, and it's a very lonely moment.
She also linked the peace process to the controversy over LGBT students.
She said that, as Colombians continued to weigh the benefits of an agreement with FARC, it would be a turning point in the world, and they must take into account the root causes of the conflict.
She said, "A peaceful country should promote inclusion or tolerance of exclusion; should it provide equal opportunities for all?"
Although she was unhappy that she had been the object of insult and harassment this week, she was pleased that in Colombia today gay students could look up to her and think that they could one day become ministers.
Ms. Perjotti said, "It's important for me that they be comfortable and aware that they can use their full potential."
We can't wait until the next suicide.
Ensuring the security of the electoral network — The New York Times
According to a news report published on August 4, "The United States seeks ways to stop hackers from getting to the ballot box," the government has been trying to find a way out of the voting box.
US Secretary of Homeland Security Jay Johnson said that Obama's government is discussing additional protective measures for the US electoral system.
This change may be necessary and should be considered for immediate implementation.
The diverse nature of the cyberthreat and recent indications that some external actors (possibly nation States) have shown greater interest in influencing elections in the United States make it urgent for the federal Government to pay additional attention to the security of the national electoral system as an integral part of the critical infrastructure of the United States.
It is not too late for Mr. Johnson to communicate with thousands of jurisdictions in the United States that have helped to conduct the elections and to provide the assistance, expertise and guidance of the Department of Homeland Security.
Our voting infrastructure is of various types, which places security in a difficult position, but it also tells us that the process should start as soon as possible.
The article was written by a senior member of the House of Commons Homeland Security Committee, a Mississippi Democrat.
In recent days, the British Government has suddenly announced a suspension of the Cape Hinkele nuclear power plant project in the United Kingdom, which has attracted widespread attention both at home and abroad.
Today, the British Government spokesperson stated that the postponement of the project by the British side did not mean that the enthusiasm for China had cooled down, that the Chinese and British were still cooperating in a wide range of areas, and that the United Kingdom would continue to seek strong relations with China.
Experts pointed out that China ' s nuclear power is at the world ' s leading level in terms of technology, safety performance, operational experience, etc., and at relatively low cost.
Therefore, despite the fact that "nuclear power out of the sea" will be tested for a certain period of time, the trend towards mutually beneficial cooperation among the parties will not change under the great potential for win-winness.
And the British performance on the Cape Hinkele nuclear power project is clearly difficult to describe.
Once completed, the project will meet 7 per cent of the UK ' s electricity demand; and during 60 years of operation, it will reduce carbon dioxide by 9 million tons per year.
Analysts are generally of the view that complex factors such as the exposure of Britain ' s own economic risks, increased internal political divisions, cumbersome follow-up procedures and increased uncertainty in the future collectively constitute obstacles to nuclear power projects.
"The current decline in real estate prices in the United Kingdom, the beginning of capital outflows, and the stabilization of the domestic economy and the market system have become a top priority for the new British Government.
At the same time, after the Trans-European referendum, the United Kingdom will be faced with a series of de-European procedures and the re-establishment of relations with European Union countries such as France.
Xu Ming Chessi said that although the British new government wanted to be "different" from the previous government, it did not deny the positive effect of the nuclear power project.
But in the past 20 years, the development of nuclear power in Britain has stalled, and most of the 15 existing nuclear power plants have reached their design life.
The British White Paper on Energy predicts that there will be only one nuclear power plant in the UK in operation by 2025, when there will be a major gap in electricity supply.
It is for this reason that there is widespread concern about the British suspension of this project, which concerns the well-being of the people.
Skoller believes that China can play a key role in helping Britain rebuild its infrastructure as long as it is in the interests of both countries.
Liu Xiaoming indicated that the project will only be successfully launched to provide Britain with safe, reliable and sustainable energy at an early date.
According to industry, the nuclear power plant project will not only help the British to reduce the cost of electricity, but will also boost the local economy and generate employment.
Therefore, if the new British Government finally decides from the perspective of maximizing the well-being of the population, the future of the nuclear power project will not be pessimistic.
The British side can ease the energy demand gap, while the Chinese and French sides can find markets for their superior technologies and products in the field of nuclear power for the benefit of more people ... "
Despite the increased uncertainty about the Cape Hinkley nuclear power plant project, the high level and maturity of Chinese nuclear power technology are certain.
In the case of the Chinese "Walong One", which was scheduled to enter the British nuclear power market, it was designed to integrate the advantages of other advanced nuclear technology designs and to learn from past experience.
For example, in response to the problems reflected in the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan, China designed the "vapour generator secondary non-dynamic residual heat discharge" system, which allows the core heat to be removed in time to avoid the core melting.
Liu Xiaoming indicated that China has maintained good performance and safety standards in the development of nuclear power for more than 30 years and that its achievements in nuclear power development and regulation have been highly appreciated by international agencies.
The Chinese-British relationship is at an important historic moment, and mutual respect and trust are all the more precious.
China hopes that the British Government will continue to support the Cape Hinke nuclear power plant project and make an early decision to ensure its successful implementation.
In the view of Ho Weiwen, Co-Chair of the Centre for Economic Strategic Studies of Central America and Europe of the China International Trade Institute, there is not much time left for the British to make a decision, and the Chinese and British should make the necessary contacts and communication.
" The Sino-Arab nuclear power plant project has also been put on hold following the change of the Argentine presidency, but after positive progress, the Sino-Arab nuclear power plant project is now clearly scheduled to start next January... "

The ninth China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week has been officially in existence since 8 August, and 70 events will be held throughout the year.
During the previous opening period, government officials from China and the 10 ASEAN countries, university principals, expert scholars, etc., had effectively exchanged educational development plans.
Moreover, it is worth noting that the second round table of Chinese-ASEAN Ministers of Education has gathered again six years after the convening of 11 Ministers of Education.
This year is the "China-ASEAN Year of Educational Exchange" and the twenty-fifth anniversary of the establishment of the China-ASEAN dialogue.

It is understood that nearly 800 cooperation agreements have been signed during the many consecutive years of educational exchange weeks between the two sides, and that cooperation in human exchanges continues to be a win-win process.
The ninth China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week and the second China-ASEAN Round Table of Ministers of Education were of particular interest as flagship projects for the Year.
And there was a unveiling ceremony for the China-ASEAN Clear Town Vocational Teaching Centre, the China-ASEAN Orbital Transport Education and Training Coalition.

"The China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week has played an irreplaceable role in deepening the humanistic exchange between the two sides, building the Bridge of the Spirit, the Bridge of Friendship, the Bridge of Understanding. "
Today, there is a sharp increase in the focus on tumours, which may be highly correlated with the high incidence of cancer in recent years.
According to the 2012 cancer report, the country has about 3.37 million new cancer cases and 2.11 million deaths per year.
Cancer has become the leading cause of death in my country, accounting for one quarter of all cancer deaths worldwide.
Cancer is the uncontrolled growth and spread of cells, which can affect almost any part of the body.
Generally speaking, any part of the body may have a tumor, some of which may be transferred to the rest of the body.
Cancer is a genetic disease, but research has found that only a fraction of cancer is genetic.
Many factors influence the development of cancer, of which environmental factors are most important and can be changed.
Environmental factors include smoking, transmission factors, radiation, pollution, food, nutrition, physical activity, etc.
To the hospital, the doctor told the family that Master Li was severely dehydrated due to diarrhoea, causing a high permeability coma, that he was in critical condition and that he might be dead by a few minutes later.
According to statistics, approximately 20 per cent of diabetes patients are likely to experience diarrhoea, most of them without treatment or poor blood sugar control.
Some diabetic patients even suffer from chronic diarrhoea, which is highly confusing, leading to poor and misdiagnosed diagnosis.
Diarrhoea caused by indigestion, anorexia, nausea, digestive medications will improve; bacterial diarrhoea is often very acute, several times a day, abdominal pain, and short-term treatments are generally cured.
Diabetes diarrhea, often manifested in persistent diarrhoea, with no visible abdominal pain, and with much less co-infection in the urine, is significantly higher than 20 times a day.
In addition, some degeneratives, such as the start-up of sugar-sullitudinals, such as diazine or alpha glucose enzyme inhibitors, may have side effects such as abdominal swelling, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, etc.
It's because, after diarrhoea, if there's an inflammation, there's a stressful high blood sugar and a low blood sugar condition after the tummy.
Moreover, because of the stress state of the human body caused by diarrhoea, the release of various hormones and the additional mobilization of a large amount of blood sugar in the fight against diarrhoea may also cause ketamine acid poisoning in severe cases.
Therefore, following diarrhoea among sugar friends, in addition to medical treatment for causes, attention should be paid to the following points.
Diabetes with acute diarrhoea must first of all prevent dehydration, so it is important to drink more water and then pee more, both for extra blood sugar and for ketamine.
But don't drink caffeine, because caffeine will stimulate intestinal worms and increase diarrhea.
Diabetes suffer from acute diarrhoea from an imbalance in blood sugar regulation, which must be closely observed and preferably measured every three to four hours.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently approved field testing of genetically modified mosquitoes in Florida in the south-east.
This genetically modified mosquito can help control the spread of mosquito-borne infections, such as the virus, dengue fever and Kikonkenya fever.
The preliminary environmental assessment report released by FDA in March this year also concluded that the mosquito would not significantly affect the environment.
But the report also states that this does not amount to authorizing the use of genetically modified mosquitoes for commercial purposes.
Oxford Insect Technology is also required to comply with other federal, state and local government regulations and to decide, together with its local partner, the time for field trials in the Florida Islands mosquito control area.
In Brazil, tests conducted in Panama and the Cayman Islands show that this genetically modified mosquito can reduce the number of mosquitoes in the test area by more than 90 per cent.
There is also controversy over the use of transgenic technology to combat mosquitoes, which some experts believe will have an unknown impact on the environment.

According to Swedish Daily News, identity theft has become one of the fastest-growing crimes in Swedish society.
Identity theft is a criminal form of illegal access to other persons ' identity information as a means of falsifying others ' profits.
Sifo survey data show that one fourth of the respondents in the past 12 months have revealed personal information in e-mails, text messages or other social media.
The Managing Director of the Swedish insurance company My Safety noted that one of the reasons for the high incidence of identity theft was the lack of caution in the use of personal information, which allowed criminals to drill.
The Swedish police have reportedly invested considerable resources in combating identity theft since this summer.
It is only a criminal act to use theft as a fraudulent activity, such as online shopping in the name of another person.
According to the Swedish Daily News, the rental market in major Swedish cities has burst.
The most recent data show that the waiting time for a single rental home has been extended over a period of almost a year, rather than reduced.
In particular, the waiting period for houses in the central city of Sdergormo and the suburbs has been extended for up to two years.
At present, the average waiting time for a one-hand house contract in Stockholm is at least 16.5 years, while the average waiting time for a single-hand rental home in the outskirts of Stockholm is 13 years.
According to the head of the Swedish Housing Authority ' s market, the market for first-hand rentals in Stockholm has grown too fast, waiting for the source of the houses to reach an all-time high.
The demand for one-hand rentals is reported to be growing despite the thousands of new houses in Stockholm being handed over this year.
According to the data, in the first half of the year there were only 2006 single-hand houses (only old ones, not included in new rentals), and more than 540,000 people were in line.
The Swedish daily estimates that it will take 130 years to apply for a rental dwelling if the current pace is followed.
Data for the last 12 months show that the housing crisis is not merely a phenomenon in the capital city, Stockholm, but that the waiting period for one-hand rental housing in the Gothenburg and Malmö regions has been extended to varying degrees.

On Thursday, a boy fell and was injured in a minibus and then flown to a hospital in Pittsburgh, where emergency services and park officials said it was the third accident in the United States of America this week when children were injured by playground devices.
A female spokesperson at the Westmoreland Emergency Services Centre described the wounded child (his identity was not disclosed) being flown to the Pittsburgh Children's Hospital, about 50 miles west of the "Idlewild and SoakZone" theme park in Ligonil, Pennsylvania.
The park spokesman, Jeff Crawshaw, said in an e-mail that the three-year-old boy was playing with his brother in a mountain car and that he was still conscious when he was on the scene.
Crawshaw said that the instrument called "Rollo Pass" would be shut down pending investigation.

Japanese Current Affairs News Agency: Japanese Prime Minister Abe will not join the Yasukuni shrine on the anniversary of World War II
According to the Japanese Current News Agency, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will not join the controversial Tokyo Constabulary on World War II Japan's Day of War Lost.
However, the Japanese Current News Agency reported on Thursday that Abe planned to offer a sacrifice to the Yasukuni shrine on Monday, as usual, to commemorate that anniversary.
The shrine served 14 Japanese leaders convicted as war criminals and was regarded by China and South Korea as symbols of Japanese militarism during the war.
Abe has not been personally present at the Yasukuni shrine since December 2013 and said that he had joined the shrine in order to show respect to those who had given their lives in the service of the nation.
The new Minister of Defence of Japan, Yomi Hida, refused to say whether she would join the Yasukuni shrine, which she considered to be a question of conscience.
As Abe's close ally and supporter of changing Japan's peace constitution, Yomi Hida used to be a frequent worshiper of the Yasukuni shrine.
According to the Commons, the Japanese Minister of Rehabilitation Yahiro Hiromura visited the shrine on Thursday and expressed his prayers for peace and prosperity in Japan.
The relationship between China and Japan, the two largest economies in Asia, has recently strained as a result of the increasing number of Chinese marine police vessels and other government vessels sailing near disputed islands at the east coast of China (known by Japan as the Senkaku Islands and by China as the Fishing Islands).
Police sources: two suspects arrested on suspicion of conspiracy against the Rio Olympics
The police arrested two men on Thursday on suspicion of having planned a possible attack during the Rio Olympics in support of the Islamic State.
The police arrested 12 people during their operation on Thursday, all suspected of collaborating with ISIS militants.
According to the Brazilian Federal Police, three others were released after interrogation.
Both arrested on Thursday were Brazilian, but the police did not provide their names or other details.
Although there has been no record of conflict with known armed groups in Brazil ' s history, the Government has indicated that the Olympic Games have made Brazil likely to be the target of (attacks), especially in the countries that are participating in the competition, where the fight against the Islamic State is ongoing.
ISIS militants control parts of Iraq and Syria and the United States-led coalition has carried out air strikes against them.

A new suspect in the murder of a French priest was formally indicted.
Police sources told Reuters on Friday that a French pastor had been murdered last month and that an official investigation into a man arrested on Monday had begun as part of the investigation into the case.
According to the source, the 21-year-old suspect was accused of collaborating with terrorists and planning an attack on the population.
The man had telephone contact with Adel Kermić and Abdu Lemarik Padján, who broke into a church ceremony on 26 July in the western French town of St. Etienne Durufray and cut the throat of 85-year-old Roman Catholic priest Jacques Hamer.
Both killers were killed by the police.
The source revealed that a few days before the attack, the suspect travelled from his home near Toulouse to and spent the night in the town of St. Etienne Durufray.
According to the source, the young man had no criminal record and he admitted to spending the night there, but told the investigators that he had left the following day because of his disharmony with Adel and Abdou.
Investigators are trying to determine whether Kermić and Padjean are complicit in France and have links with ISIS militants who claimed responsibility for the attack.
A cousin of Padjean was also taken into preventive custody at the end of the month.

The security concerns of the bombers at the Rio Olympics outside the races have been a concern, and before the boys' basket game this morning, there was another bomb shock.
On the OCC side, it was confirmed that the police and the military had conducted a controlled detonation of a suspicious backpack found in the basketball hall before the boys' basketball game in Spain and Nigeria began.
According to Reuters, a security officer said that this package could be found after the Brazilian-Croatian competition.

When the Spanish-Nigerian game started, there were no fans on the field, and the police confirmed that they were safe before they got in.
The Spanish male basket's NBA superstar Gathor said that the players were at one point confused about the situation: "We heard the explosion, but we don't know what it was.
In the beginning, we just heard the explosion and looked around, but we saw nothing wrong with it. "
Previously, at the Rio Olympic men's road bike race, there was also a threat of suspected bombs, and the bomb squads controlled the detonation of suspicious parcels near the finish line.
The summer heat is so hot that there is a marked increase in skin problems among young children, and their appearance is closely linked to sweating.
As long as the temperature is high, it's the beginning of a lot of parents' nightmares, children's skin itches, red rashes, red spots, and so on, always scratching and crying at night.
Paediatrician Tan Xiaohua, a third hospital attached to the Guangzhou Medical School, observed that every summer, the proportion of children suffering from small diseases in outpatient clinics increases, mosquito bites, humid rashes, hot tweeds, diaper rashes, etc. skin problems are more acute.
Although the cause is different, the symptoms are similar, with red rashes, red spots, and itches.
In fact, the causes of these skin diseases are similar, because the kids are not "clean," sweating, drooling, not drying in time.
According to Dr. Tan Xiaohua, the skin of the young is more delicate and sweatier than that of the adult.
In addition, children ' s sweaty glands are growing and some children ' s sweaty glands and skin glands are not yet balanced.
"Some parents get used to wearing a little towel, see the kid sweat, dry him up. "
"and wet clothes, sweaty kids, often seeing skin rashes on him."
If the summer is too hot and the baby sweats too much, parents can increase the frequency of showers and change him dry clothes.
One bath a day, for example, can be added now, but more baths can be washed only without bathing.
In addition, the prevention of summer skin disease allows for the introduction into the baby ' s bath water of anticipatory water from herbal ingredients, such as gold and silver, which can help to evacuate the pores and help to sweat.
The above basic work to be done to protect the skin of the baby may also be handled differently by the parents for different skin diseases, as described below.
But it is important to remind you that if there is a pepsis, or if there is a recurrence, then it is recommended that medical treatment be taken and that the possibility of other diseases be checked.

As at 10 August, 66 countries and territories had reported evidence of mosquito vector transmission since 2015.
Some countries or parts of some countries reported a decline in the number of cases of haemorrhagic infections, but based on the evidence available at this stage, the overall incidence of haemorrhagic attacks does not show any signs of a decline.
According to the World Health Organization, in mainland China, although there has been a feed into the virus, there has been no local transmission of the virus from mosquitoes to humans.
The President of the Philippines, Mr. Duarte, said on 12th that he had called the United States Ambassador to Fifi Philip Goldberg but would not apologize to Gothenburg.
The United States Embassy in the Philippines issued a statement on 12 December that the United States had noted reports of criticism of Godag, which was "unsuitable and unacceptable".
In April of this year, during the Philippine presidential election campaign, Goldberg accused Dutt of human rights issues, and the two sides continued to speak out and clash.
On August 12, Beijing time, the Spanish male basket beat Nigeria with 96-87 and saw a ray of hope.
Auguchi dropped 12 out of seven, two out of three, all hit, 24 out of 24, Akonon 12 out of five, Ebeckwi out of 11.
As a traditional European force, Spain has been pushed into a difficult situation, even from the team, due to the absence of Major-General Mark-Gassol.
In the face of Nigeria, the weakest opponent of this group, Spain has also had a very hard time trying to get past it at the last minute.
In the last minute and 20 seconds of this section, Nigeria failed to score, Rodríguez scored three points, Spain took the lead 25-11 after five points.
In the second section, with 3 minutes and 54 seconds left, Gathor is still in the front line of 40-27.
In six minutes and nine seconds, Loul will be fined two, and Spain will regain its double-digit advantage by 61-48.
When Auguche scores three points, Spain scores four points, extending its advantage to 14.
However, in the last 4 minutes and 49 seconds of this section, Spain failed to score again, with flowers blooming inside and outside Nigeria ending with a wave of 13-0 and exceeding 66-65, which was their first time in the field.
Nigeria scored three points in two of the attacks, and there's a three-point breach.
At 3 minutes and 49 seconds, when Aminu wins, Nigeria will have a score of 79-81.
When Okuchi hit three points, Nigeria narrowed the gap to one point, Reyes and Ghasor scored six points on the ball, and one minute and 15 seconds before the game, they took the lead in 89-82.
During the 22nd round of the Mid-Soviet match, held on the evening of August 12th, Beijing's National Security Fair took on 1-2 kling sails.
After a few moments of adjustment, Dabao came back, but the trouble wasn't really lifted and he was replaced by Song Bo at the 76th minute because he couldn't hold on.
What is even more disturbing is that Dabao is no longer able to move, that he was carried off by a stretcher, that he was treated for almost 10 minutes on the spot, and that he was taken directly to the first aid truck.
And speaking of the foot of the nation, Dabao's injury will have an impact on the country's 12 strong races in half a month's time.
This week, Dabao was injured in a match between the Chinese Airfield and the Zero-0 war, and he and Paulino fell both ways in a heated brawl, resulting in a neck injury.
The serious traumas of Han-hyun in that game are more disturbing, and conservatively estimated to require a recovery period of four months, which means that Han-hyun will be absent from at least the first half of the 12th.
If Dabao's injuries are worse, the configuration of the country's front-end candidates will be greatly affected.
However, engineers at the University of California at Berkeley took the concept a step further by developing very small wireless sensors to detect health conditions in the human body.
The researchers described their inventions in the magazine Neuros, published on August 3.
Moreover, these sensors not only do not need batteries but can also be used to stimulate nerves and muscles.
This may provide a way to treat disorders such as epilepsy or activate the human immune system.
This device has been implanted in the muscles and tail nerve of the rat and uses ultrasound as an energy source and reads the collected data.
The sensor has been reduced to a cubic millimetre called "neur dust", which contains a voltage crystal.
The author of this paper explained that this crystal converts ultrasonic vibrations emitted from the outside of the human body into electricity for a tiny transistor in the drive, which is directly connected to a nerve or muscle fibre.
High voltage peaks in fibres cause changes in current circuits and crystal vibrations so that ultrasound receivers (which are still mainly the source of ultrasound vibrations) detect echoes.
Since ultrasound technology is common in hospitals and ultrasound vibrates through most bodies, it looks like a natural choice.
Michel Maharbiz is an associate professor in electronic engineering and computer science at the University of California at Berkeley.
As a co-author of the paper, he said in a statement, "I think the long-term prospects of neurological dust are not confined to nerves and brains, but much wider."
Maharbiz and colleagues and Jose Carmena, neuroscientist at the University of California at Berkeley, led the study.
He explained that "the introduction of telemetry in the body was never possible because a super small object could not be placed in a very deep place.
But now I can pick up a tiny object, put it in a nervous or organ, digestive tract or muscle, and read the data. "
In order to test their devices, Maharbiz and Caarmena use six 540 nms per millisecond per ultrasound pulse to drive sensors.
But researchers are confident that they will also work in the brain and the central nervous system.
The Neurological Dust Project was originally designed to portray the next generation of brain interaction and make it a viable clinical science ... "
"If a crippled person wants to control a computer or a mechanical arm, you can implant this electrode into the brain, where it works for life."
Two lenses work at the same time, distinguishing between the obvious exteriors and the deeper.
The Kumamoto earthquake not only devastated Japan's mainland territory, but also the world's digital camera core industry chain.
Sony Japan's plant has suffered severe losses since the Kumamoto earthquake, and the status quo of the global digital camera is a shortage of goods and an increase in prices.
Sony developed sensors that were used almost for all cameras, without which the cameras could not be produced.
And recent reports suggest that Sony is currently raising nearly $3.6 billion in stocks and bonds for the development and production of a stacking CMOS.
Sony, digital cameras and mobile smarts are the only way to supply the sensors.
I'd rather see Sony back to normal than the news of the new format, but the cost of the camera is just too much to see.
Macy's gonna shut down 100 stores.
On Thursday, the department store's giant Macy's department store said that the company planned to close 100 shops, a major initiative aimed at helping the company out of a potentially serious problem: the company claimed that there were too many real stores in the United States in an era of online shopping.
Macy's department regularly adjusts the under-the-street mix, often closing dozens of underperforming stores immediately after annual holiday peaks.
However, in a summer announcement, the company announced that 15% of the 728 shops under its flag would be closed. The chain company seems to be taking a more aggressive stance than many retail counterparts, reducing the size of the shop to meet the rapidly changing shopping environment in reality.
Walkers and shoppers walk through a Macy's department store in New York.
The retail giants are planning to shut down 100 shops.
There are many reasons why Macy's department stores are trying to change: many of the stores under the company are located in small, district-style shopping malls where people's traffic has been severely disrupted by the rise of e-commerce.
Moreover, as buyers increasingly tend to go to discount retailers (e.g. T.J. Maxx) and fast fashion companies (e.g. H&M) to buy their clothing, the retail type of department stores is generally in a difficult position.
These factors, coupled with short-term problems (e.g. a decline in international tourist consumption and untimely weather) have led to a difficult period of more than a year for Macy's stores.
On Thursday, the company indicated that comparable sales had fallen by 2.6 per cent in the last quarter and that performance had been weak, although it had improved compared to the bleak performance of 6.1 per cent in the previous quarter.
The retailer earned $5.87 billion ($7.64 billion), a decline of 3.9 per cent over the same period in the previous year.
Macy's department said that the closure of these stores could reduce annual sales by about $1 billion.
In the past, the closure of such a large number of stores could be seen as a compromise made by a retailer as a result of a failure to operate.
However, the company ' s stock stock surged by 17 per cent on Thursday, indicating that investors viewed it as a positive sign of a stronger performance by the Macy Department of Commerce in the future.
In some ways, it's not a surprise that Macy's department store is downsized.
Macy's Chief Executive Officer Terry Lundgren once said that this chain was just too many stores.
Senior management has been saying for some time that they are developing a strategy to focus on about 150 of the best-performing shops and try to squeeze more sales in places that perform well.
Jeff Djinnet, who replaced Lundgren as Chief Executive Officer in 2017, stated in a statement that all of the stores that the company planned to close were those where sales and profits had been falling.
Jeanette said, "We recognize that the returns on investment in these locations are inadequate and often fail to demonstrate the client shopping experience that we expect from the Macy brand."
The company said it would provide a list of shops to be closed down.
Macy's department says it's still making a final decision about which stores to close, so it's not yet possible to determine exactly how many jobs will be cut.
The retailer will not withdraw completely from any of the first-class malls currently in operation, but will seek closure of those in underperforming locations.
This may not be good news for mall operators, who rely on large tenants like Macy's to attract and retain other smaller stores to operate in the mall.
Did you hide dangerous bacteria in your water bottle?
According to the new study, in terms of the amount of bacteria you'll be exposed to, drinking water from water bottles that can be refilled may be "in many cases worse than adding to your puppies' toys".
The website called Runner Review commissioned EmLab P&K to test 12 water bottles of four different types (including rotor, slide, squeeze cap and straw cap).
Every bottle of water is used by an athlete for a week without cleaning.
Your water bottle, refilled with water, could be dirty like a dog's toy.
Treadmill Reviews says: "Based on the 12 water bottles tested, we found that reusable drinking water containers can harbour an alarming number of active cells: more than 300,000 units per square centimetre of cacterium formation (CFU). "
The experiment found the highest bacterial content of a sliding water bottle, with an average of more than 900,000 cm2 of cacterium formation.
The bottle covers contain gland-positive bacterium, which causes skin infections, pneumonia or blood poisoning.
The second was the squeezed cap bottle, which formed 162,000 units per square centimetre, while the rotor bottle was close to 160,000 CFUs per square centimetre.
The website adds: "Drinking water with these water bottles may be worse than eating food with your pet dishes."
The results were much better from the test of a piped water bottle containing bacteria far smaller than those of other water bottles, with only 25 CFUs per square centimetre.
It's probably because the water goes to the bottom of the straw instead of staying in the bottle attracting humid bacteria.
The bacteria in the straw cap bottle is described as "normally harmless".
The website says: "According to the results of the experiment, we recommend the use of a straw cap bottle because of its low bacterial prevalence and the low number of harmful bacteria."
We also learned that stainless steel bottles are a better option than plastic bottles in the case of water bottles and bacteria.
In addition, it is less likely that water bottles that do not have sutures and are difficult to clean spots will become bacterial hosts.
The website recommends that readers wash water bottles after each time they are used, preferably by using weak bleaching solutions.
Religion must be modernized before it is eliminated.
The US Democratic Party recently nominated Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.
If the latest poll results remain unchanged at the time of the election, the first female president in American history will be sworn in in in January.
Last week, on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, British Prime Minister Teresa Metzmer and German Chancellor Angela Merkel negotiated the terms of British withdrawal from the European Union.
The glorification of women living in Western societies in the process of their development convinces them of their ability to perform any professional role and succeed through education, dedication and hard work.
Today, young women can use as their role models some living people who work at the highest levels of leadership.
So, the long and arduous struggle for equal rights for women is finally over?
Hillary Clinton is ready to be elected President of the United States, but female leadership remains a controversial issue in the field of religion.
Well, it's not all over.
Women ' s leadership remains a controversial issue in the field of religion.
Last week, Pope Francis announced the establishment of a new committee to discuss whether women should be appointed to the Catholic Church.
In January 2015, the Anglican Church appointed Libby Ryan as the first Bishop of the Church, and in 2012 a similar attempt ended in failure.
Although the Jewish Reform Movement has appointed a female Rabbi since the early 1970s, there has been a conservative movement since the 1980s, and there is still a fierce debate in orthodox Judaism about female Rabbi.
In November 2015, the orthodox Jewish Council of the United States issued a solemn proclamation declaring the illegality of the female Rabbi, the Council ' s third attempt to resist the growing trend of pro-Orthodox women in accordance with the rule of law in Libaby.
It is ironic that, at the time of the nomination of the Presidential candidate for Hillary Clinton Receiving Democratic Party, a group of American orthodox rabbis opposed to women in their holy position launched a series of hearings on this controversial topic.
Why is there such a gap between the secular and religious spheres?
Like most sects, orthodox Judaism seeks to maintain stability in what it considers to be a continuation of traditional values.
This is reflected in resistance to the pressure to adapt to a changing society.
Those who oppose it are based on the fact that a woman's sacrosanct position is not in keeping with tradition.
But keeping tradition in this way is not without cost.
The price of this loyalty may deprive the traditional community of the oxygen on which it depends, thereby destroying the tradition itself against its wishes.
In the Military History of the First World War, "August Gunfire", Barbara Tachiman highlighted the dangers of tradition through the history known as "The Tragedy of Red Pants".
On the eve of World War I, as the war progresses from close combat to heavy artillery fire from further distance, covert soldiers will prevail for as long as possible.
The British and German army responded to this change by replacing the coloured uniform with a single gray and brown uniform.
However, French soldiers still carry the same red hats and pants and become very visible targets on the battlefield.
The French Army Minister Adolf Meshimi's proposal that his troops follow the same approach was scoffed and rejected.
The red pants represent the honor and prestige of the army, and the military traditionalists are not going to give it up.
In a parliamentary hearing, the former Minister of the Army, Eugene Etienne, addressed France.
And he said, "You want to get rid of the red pants?"
Never!
Massimi later wrote: "A blind and foolish attachment to the most visible colours has led to cruel consequences."
Religious leaders who resist the role of women in religious leadership are at risk of the same trap.
They focus only on the "traditional practices" of their religion without asking themselves the key question: "What changes are necessary to keep religion alive?" Their risk is to alienate 50% of the population.
They also make the entire community exclude the talent, skills and enthusiasm that women can contribute.
As far as religion is concerned, it may be traditional to insist on keeping men in those pants, but it may not be worth it, as revealed by the loss of red pants.
Deena Bauer was a founding member of the British Union of Jewish orthodox Feminism and an orthodox Rabbi student at the "Yeshivat Maharat" Jewish School in New York.
Charlton team fans can only get season tickets if they sign a code of conduct agreement and agree not to denigrate the club on social media.
While we recognize the right of everyone to have their own personal views, it is not helpful to post inflammatory statements on social networking sites.
The administrative fan was then told that he had to go personally to former Chief Constable Cliff Egg to get tickets, and that Cliff Egg joined the club last month after 35 years of police life.
The letter goes on to say, "I need to remind you that you will be given a "conditional" ticket for the season, and you will have to sign a "contract of engagement", which requires you to exercise restraint in the future, not to post derogatory or inflammatory statements against the club or its representative on any social media website, or to do any other act that may be considered antisocial in nature. "
The fan described to the Daily Telegraph how he first paid for the season tickets and then called the club, but two days later, the ticket didn't show up, but received this letter.
Yesterday, after he went to the club for an interview, he said, "They told me that my comments on Twitter have always been extreme and have influenced the tweets of others, which I find absurd."
A holiday ride off the coast of Dalmatia.
What do you mean, luxury?
Former U.S. Navy Commander Colleen said, "I got rid of my ass." "She just finished a 25-mile ride along the rugged Croatian ridge, leaving a trail of sweat and a string of naval squeals in the face of the tough mountain road.
Some bike riders sing hymns or recite songs that distract themselves from the difficult climb.
Corinne's friend Patti suggested huming "the minivan did it."
Others either count circles or put up with it, thinking about how to get into what the seasoned riders call a trance.
Colleen curses in all kinds of vicious ways.
It's like being chased by Hugh Grant in a movie about four weddings and a funeral.
Her and my mission was to conduct a week-long cruise of luxury cruises and bicycles on the coasts and islands of Dalmatia in northern Croatia, organized by Freedom Treks.
The practice of cycling in steep places like Croatia may not be in keeping with the luxury concept of everyone, but it is said that Northern Dharmatia is easier to ride than the South, that we use soft seating mats and that, a few months ago, when we filled out the reservation form with careless and confidence, there was an option that would ensure that we could be assisted with an electric bike by ticking, but we didn't.
The luxury part of the deal is that we'll be living in a floating home for a week, and that's a brand-new melody cruiser.
At the end of the ride, we can leave our bikes at the docks, where our guides Ivan and Ivana will clean it up, and then we jump out of the back of the cruise ship into the blue sea, clear sea, easy to distinguish between sea urchins, sharp rocks and other vagrants, which the Croats call the beach, with long pellets of handkerchiefs.
This seawater is the ideal temperature at the end of June, and we all agree that it's cool enough to lift our heads, but it's not cold.
If someone feels alive after a tough ride in the morning, there's a mask, a breathing tube and a few pineboats on board the melody.
But most of us would rather go back to the air conditioning cabin, and Helena, the masseuse on board, would have made our bed, filled the food in the fridge, and left a new box of chocolate on the table.
Ivan says it's important to do stretching after the bike ride. We practice stretching on our own beds or on the top deck bench in the afternoon. Bartender Antonio stands ready to offer his cocktails.
The melody cruiser is not a superior super tanker, but a stylish little cruiser with a size of 42 metres with 15 cabins and half dozen crews.
Of all the fishing boats and vacation cruise ships in the small island ports, she has come to the fore, and we are very proud to be part of it.
Colleen and Patti came from a group of friends of a website called Meetup.com in Washington, D.C.: they called themselves "the 45+ sports and social groups."
Last year's barge and bicycle holidays in the Netherlands were successful, so they decided to try something more risky, and now they're in Croatia.
A small church competing with their church is on a cruise ship and bicycle holiday in Provence, and every afternoon you come to me on Facebook to make it easier.
The risk element in the holidays may be exaggerated, because if it's not strictly regulated, we won't be able to keep up with the schedule.
When we sailed from the glorious old port of Trogir near Split, Ivan announced to the first arrivals, "Beat and dinner are scheduled at 8:00."
One bell on the ship means the buffet starts and one more bell after the meal is over. Please be quiet and listen carefully to the next briefing.
"Good moving" except for the British, I'm afraid.
Even though Ivana came up with the foot map of the day, we all pretended to be bent around it, the shadows and the routes of rise and fall, but everything else would be a surprise for a bike hike from the coast to the coast in Croatia.
Ivan said, "It's like an EKG."
A perfectly flat route is not in the recommended range.
Ivan gave a brief presentation in English and German.
He's been dealing with tourists from more than a dozen countries for weeks, but we're an easy group of people (Swiss, Germans, Americans and British) who eat with two tables of English and one table of German.
We've all been friends all along.
Friendship improves on riding, and the only competition is terrain, which means self-competition.
It's the most harmonious, relaxed group I remember.
We'll be moving quickly to Ivan's wavelength.
It's hard to climb a section of the road. Don't get confused with a section of the road. It's easier.
The hair-cracking section refers to a rolling segment, while the straight-line section means a straight ride: it's simple but not always easy.
Ride orders are always the same: "A column, keep your distance, it's not a race."
We'll meet at the docks at 9:00.
Well, it's 9:05. I forgot you were on vacation.
We need a lot of water.
We began two days of north cruise from Trogill, through the Konati Islands, where we would walk a long way along the Dugi Otok and, when we woke up, walk at Traska Nature Park, appreciate the high cliff cliffs and the salt lakes formed as a result of the introduction of seawater from underground corridors.
It's said that swimming in this lake can revive people.
If we go into the water, will our feet get younger and stronger?
On the island known as Morat, we turned south again, improvising between the land and the nearby islands.
Most of our journeys are on empty roads in the countryside, along open seascapes and various kinds of fruit and vegetables: olive groves, vineyards and thorns; in the air, the Mediterranean is breathful and countless butterflies flap their wings.
There's always a breeze on the way, but the shades are so precious that Ivan has stopped the convoy and rest in a place like this, and the cool little pool is a reward for early riders.
This movement and social groups organize a lot of group bike riding on weekends, they know the manners, they do all kinds of reminders on the way, and they let the road out of the way so that the drivers can move beyond the road safely.
When a truck tried to overtake a dead end and brake an emergency, one rider said to another, "You almost hit the head."
Fortunately, they passed safely.
And occasionally, when we had to ride on the main road, Ivan divided us into three groups, with Ivana at the end of the team encouraging the team, as Ivan called it.
When we have to cross the main road, we all gather, get out and walk, push the bike to safety on the other side, and act on instructions and not make our own claims.
As we stood by the road waiting for instructions to cross, a Swiss rider asked, "Do you think Ivan realizes that he's not giving orders to a group of children?"
Our afternoons aren't always free.
During the city trip to Zadal, we visited the Rome Forum site and the wave organ, the music of which was like the groaning of the sea monster in the cage, the music of which was delivered through a pipe that opened its mouth to the sea, and which was placed in a corridor made of stones.
After the meal was a perfect moment to enjoy the famous sunset view of Zadal. After dusk, we returned to the waves, and we enjoyed the light that was lit by the waves on the sidewalk of the glass, which was like the ground dancing.
When the melody sailed into Belgrade in the early mornings of the hot resort, the sound of the waves was like whispering in the ear.
The fifth day is a free ride.
A boat cruise to the sea entrance of the Kerka River and watch its waterfalls; an afternoon tour of the Cathedral of the Cybénik, a masterpiece of the Dalmatian Renaissance; and a dusk on the quiet island of Zlaline, looking for local special corals — we had a very interesting day.
Lourdes was prepared to greet pilgrims despite the threat of attack.
The people gathered at the Holy Places of Notre Dame de Lourdes during the annual Catholic pilgrimage.
As thousands of Catholics gather for their annual pilgrimage in Notre Dame de Lourdes, French security forces are on high alert, as a series of terrorist attacks have only recently occurred.
August 15th is the day when the Virgin Mary will be raised, and every year tens of thousands of people will be gathered at the sacred site of the Pyrenees Hills to commemorate the Day of the Virgin Mary.
On the eve of this year ' s pilgrimage, Catholicism was adversely affected by the murder of an elderly French priest, who broke into the church in northern France and slit his throat during mass on 26 July.
Two weeks before the murder of Father Jacques Hammar, a Tunisian (who, according to investigators, became an extremist as a result of the online Islamic Jihad video) drove a truck into the celebration of French National Day in the coastal city of Nice, killing 85 people.
After three large-scale attacks in 18 months, many French now have concerns about participating in public gatherings.
The number of visitors to France has fallen sharply, and the authorities are already worried that the number of visitors to the pilgrims will decline dramatically this year.
However, concerns about the elimination of mass have not materialized, and some organizers have indicated a surge in numbers at a later stage.
It is expected that there will be some 25,000 followers, including mass groups from Italy and Belgium, and a Christian Orthodox delegation of about 200 members.
Many pilgrims say they don't shrink.
A 66-year-old tourist, Christian, said to AFP, "We're not going to stop living."
Mathieu Djinyare, one of the coordinators, said, "It's important to show that life continues."
We can't give up our faith, our faith and our way of life because some fanatics are trying to spread fear.
Since the Nice attacks, France has cancelled a number of major events due to security concerns, including the large flea market in the northern city of Lille, and the European Road bike tournament scheduled to take place in September in Nice.
The priest responsible for the official pilgrimage, Fabian Lejon, said last weekend: "In the past week, I was worried about getting a call to cancel the event."
He said, however, that the attack seemed to have mobilized believers and that the number of scheduled individuals had increased dramatically at the end of the day.
Christian Grace, the head of the local hotel union, confirmed that there were signs of a "growing will" to take part in the pilgrimage after the attack.
In 1858, the Virgin Mary was passed on to the poor shepherdess, Benadette Sobiluzen, in a cave in the Holy Land.
Some 250 policemen and dozens of soldiers (including bomb disposal specialists and officers holding sniffing dogs) have been deployed to protect the region.
Pilgrims in line through security screening areas need a package search at the entrance to the scene, where the original dozen passages were reduced to three.
Catherine Simcocks, who left northeast of England for Lourdes earlier this month for a pilgrimage, described the situation of increased security.
She told the local newspaper: "Thursday morning, some armed guards were deployed in the Holy Land, then the gate (using metal barriers) was set up in a single queue to search the parcels during the entrance."
She said, "This makes my three children very nervous and afraid, and they are familiar with Lourdes, and when they ask why they are so secure, it's hard not to scare them."
It didn't destroy my experience, but it grieved me that it was necessary, and I understand that these measures reassure some.
The opening ceremony on Friday was also shortened, before leaving for the Holy Land in the city of Lourdes, and now the beginning and end point are in Notre Dame.
Other measures include closing the airspace of the city of Lourdes to ban flights, blocking traffic in the streets around the Holy Places and replacing garbage bins with transparent plastic bags.
The French Minister of the Interior, Bernard Kazenaf, will conduct a security check on Saturday.
Lourdes attracts about 6 million people to the pilgrimage every year, one of the world ' s largest Catholic pilgrim sites.
Many visitors also brought sick or disabled relatives to bathe water in the caves of the Virgin Mary claimed by Benadette and believed that the water there had therapeutic effects.
As one of the organizers, Thierry Castillo thought this year's rally was "unusual," because "intimidation seems to have taken root in France."
However, he was sure to say, "It doesn't affect the quality and depth of the pilgrimage experience."
The 58-year-old volunteer Françoise is helping the sick pilgrims, and she admits that the soldiers in the scene wearing a costume are a little too much.
But if it's all right, it's fine.
Two people were injured in the shooting at the Zaragoza mall.
A man opened fire in a shopping mall in the north-eastern Spanish city of Zaragoza, causing serious injuries to both men.
Friday at 11 a.m., this incident took place at the plentiful Atagonian Business Center in Zaragoza.
According to preliminary reports, the shooter may have hit a woman, believed to be his former partner.
The shooter escaped after the murder, and the police are now pursuing him.
Turkish diplomats missing after the attempted coup d ' état
Turkey is looking for at least 32 diplomats who could not be called back to Turkey after the attempted coup d'état of 15 July.
The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Chavusz Olu, stated on Friday that 208 personnel of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs had been recalled from various parts of the world to Ankara in the context of an investigation into the attempted coup d'état, and that 32 people had been "unauthorized" and unaccounted for.
In Turkey, some 18,000 civil servants, army leaders and academics have been arrested or suspended, and the Government believes that they are loyal to Fatoula Grant, who is present in the United States, and accuses Fatoula Grant of plotting this attempt to overthrow the Government.
Grant, now based in Pennsylvania, is wanted in Turkey.
Chavushoglu indicated that a working group of the United States Department of Justice would visit Turkey later this month to discuss the possibility of extradition of Graeme.
This issue has become an obstacle to bilateral relations between the United States and Turkey (NATO member States).
The United States opposes Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ' s illustrious policy following the coup d ' état, while Turkey ' s response is an attempt to develop closer relations with Russia.
Chavusholu stated that two Turkish military officers in Greece had fled to Italy, that one military officer in Kuwait had tried to flee to Saudi Arabia but had been repatriated, and that two generals in Afghanistan had been captured and repatriated in Dubai.
He added that two Bangladeshi civil servants had fled to New York, while one Russian civil servant had gone to Japan.
Daily Hurryiet, Ankara newspaper, quoted military sources saying that the Turkish military attachés in Jordan were also missing.
The Wall Street Journal quotes United States officials who are aware of the situation that an officer of the Turkish NATO Command Center in Virginia requested asylum in the United States.
Some people have escaped.
"Some of our diplomats have absconded, too." Chavushoglu said to the Turkish TV station NTV in an interview.
As of yesterday, the deadline had come for the first recall.
We will take legal action against those who have not yet returned.
Olympic organizers try to clean the green dive pool.
The Olympic jumper, who planned to practice on Friday, found the pool closed on arrival because the Olympic organizers spent more time cleaning up the green pool to prepare for the first personal competition at the upcoming Rio Olympics.
During a double dive on Tuesday, the pool suddenly changed color.
The organizers maintained that the pool was safe for the game after the larger pool adjacent to the waterball and fancy swimming contests was slightly green.
When the athletes arrived to prepare for the morning warm-up exercise, the diving pool was closed, although it was activated again at 1 p.m. local time, only two and a half hours from the start of the 3 metre diving competition.
The color of the pool looks almost normal, but it's still a little green.
The American diver, Abby Johnston, who participated in the boarding competition, said that when she went to the pool for a warm-up exercise, she learned that the dive was closed and that there was no advance notice.
She wrote on Twitter that #FixTheSwamp should start trend predictions.
Tom Daley, a British player who won the copper medal in a double jump, also commented on the state of the diving pool on Twitter.
Let's hope that means we won't jump in too bad a pool in the next few days!
Mario Andrada, the chief spokesperson for the local race organizing committee, stressed that the pool was safe for the game and that the three-metre pre-game was no problem.
He admitted that some athletes were worried about the pool, but said that it was due to the cleaning of the pool.
He said, "We repeat what we've been saying, this pool does not pose any threat to the health of athletes."
One or two athletes complained that they felt itchy on the day the pool went down.
That's because when we see the pool green, the first reaction is the use of chemical chlorine, which is very common in swimming pools.
We immediately reduced our use.
We re-checked the pool, and it showed that the indicators were completely within parameters.
Simon Langford, the chief spokesman for the Marialenc swimming centre, said that the diving pool was closed for additional cleaning work.
He said that this decision was supported by the International Federation of Swimming Unions.
In a statement, Langford said, "The reason why the diving pool is closed is because the pool must remain static so that the diving pool can return to its blue state as soon as possible."
Andrada said that the organizers were anxious about the deterioration of the pool.
He said, "Chemicals are not an exact science."
As you can see, something lasts longer than expected.
The rains of the past few days have even made it more difficult to restore the water color.
Andrada says, "It's not going to help improve the situation."
He added that athletes could train on land in the morning, but admitted that the arrangement was not ideal.
He explained that the coloring of the pool was due to an increase in the alkaline level, similar to the fact that the water in the aquarium could be green without proper monitoring.
When we went to solve the problem of greening the pool, the best chemicals were discussed.
Andrada says, "Athletes are being trained in the pool, so we can't use too much chemicals in water."
Of course, we should have done better at first to prevent the pool from turning green.
When the pool turned green, we made another mistake.

The Shanghai municipality announced, through its official blog account on Sina Weibo, that the senior municipal official, Shahailin, would lead a delegation to the Forum on behalf of the Mayor of Shanghai, Yang Yuo.
Since its inception in 2010, the Forum has been organized by the two cities on a rotational basis.
According to the Shanghai Municipality, the 2016 Forum will focus on exchanges in the areas of health care, intelligent cities, culture and transport, thereby "deepening communication and cooperation in all areas" between the two cities.

The President of Uganda met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of China and looked forward to enhanced cooperation
The President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, in his meeting on Thursday with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, Wang Yi, expressed his gratitude to China for its long-standing support for the development of Uganda and his desire to enhance bilateral cooperation.
Mr. Museveni stated that China was an old friend of Uganda and Africa, that it had fought alongside Africa during the liberation of Africa against colonialism, and that it had later supported Africa ' s economic and social development.
The President cited the Tanzan railway built in the 1970s as proof of China ' s generous support, when China itself was not even prosperous.
He added that such cooperation would be more conducive to Uganda ' s long-term development than simple assistance.
He hoped that China would participate in infrastructure development and industrial parks in Uganda through various means.
He also welcomed more Chinese to Uganda for investment and tourism.
Wang Ying commended Uganda for the progress made in industrialization and agricultural modernization and said that China would continue to be Uganda ' s most reliable and ideal partner.
Wang Yi stated that China was ready to do its utmost to help Uganda pursue economic and social development and stressed that cooperation between China and Uganda was sincere and free of political conditionalities, since such cooperation was based on a high degree of political mutual trust and long-term friendship.
He said that China would strengthen its cooperation with Uganda in infrastructure and industrial park development and support energy and agricultural development in that East African country.
