Last week, there was a temporary suspension of the old costume "American privates" and unexpectedly triggered a live debate about the counterfeiting of national production.
Civil rights groups have issued travel warnings against Missouri.
As a result of Missouri ' s discriminatory policies and racist attacks, the American Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued travel warnings to colored people preparing to travel to Missouri.
"The NAACP Missouri Travel Consultation, which came into effect on 28 August 2017, calls for the utmost care and caution to be exercised by all African-American travellers, tourists and Missouri travelling in Missouri as a result of the recent series of suspicious racial incidents in Missouri, and hereby informs that the group's statement states.
NAACP noted that the recent adoption of the Missouri state law made it more difficult to win discrimination proceedings and that the state ' s law enforcement also targeted minority groups to a certain extent, which prompted the organization to issue travel warnings.
Violations of civil rights are happening to people.
They were questioned by parking, beaten or killed because of their skin colour. "Rod Chapel, President of NAACP, told the Kansas City Star.
"We have received many complaints, an unprecedented number ... "
This is the first such warning the organization has issued in the United States against a state.
The organization cited the racist defamation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of a 28-year-old black man in Tennessee, Toly Sanders.
earlier this year, Saunders died under suspicious circumstances, while travelling in Missouri, he ran out of fuel and was detained without charge by Missouri police.
The consultation also noted that a recent report by the Missouri Attorney-General ' s Office indicated that "among whites, black drivers in the state are more likely to be checked by parking plates than white people."
Chapel said, "The consultation was to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues of what might happen in Missouri."
"People need to be prepared to travel to Missouri with bail or to let relatives know they're travelling in the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI hate crime report, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; according to the crime, the state ranked 16th nationwide.
Travel warnings are also a response to the new Missouri law, which will make it more difficult to prosecute housing or employment discriminatory enterprises.
Prior to the adoption of immigration law enforcement laws in the United States, requiring local law enforcement authorities to detain immigration offenders, the United States Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) indicated that this would increase the number of racial lawsuits and issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the United States Government against other countries, but recently, advisory groups have responded to certain laws and trends in the United States.
After the "gold age" of the 2015 surge, the overall film market entered a cooling period in 2016, and the achievement of $4.406 billion last year's total ticket house became a suspense.
According to data published by the National Statistical Office, in October the prices of the new and second-hand rooms in Beijing fell by only 0.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent.
Lupescu, the current CEO of the Federation of European Unions, presented a technical report at this conference on the 2016 European Cup and the last season's European Cup.
The BBC called Beijing the most exciting city: to make the foreigners feel like they're living in a new era.
On January 18, the English media reported that Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also rapidly becoming today's modern city of charm.
The capital of China has an alarmingly fast Internet, sophisticated technologies such as face-to-face recognition software, a huge investment in artificial intelligence and an unmatched internationalized energy, one of the most exciting cities for foreigners with a spirit of exploration.
According to BBC's website on January 16, German expatriate Clemens Sethy said, "If I can do it there, I can do it anywhere." He quoted a singer, Frank Sinatra, who sings the words of New York City.
"If Sinatra lives today, he'll probably sing about a city like Beijing." He says, living in this city will make you feel like a new age, always keeping up with the tide.
Home in England, but Simon Norton, who recently lived in Beijing, published an article on his blog 4 Corners7 Seas: "People generally have a feeling of being at the centre of something big, which is hard to say, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it looks like, and they want to witness it."
It is reported that the city ' s high-quality and high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment makes daily life easier than ever before.
From Manila, Andy Penyafuert, who is currently the deputy editor-in-chief of the Beijing Children's Web site, says: "Beijing is rapidly turning into a cashless society, where the Internet integrates traditional wallets to smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions."
According to reports, however, smartphones are only the beginning of Beijing ' s technological ambition, and facial recognition software is widely available, and many mobile phone applications use this technology for bank transfers and payments, for access to apartments and offices, and even for verification of the identity of Internetcafe drivers.
Beijing has also recently announced plans to spend 13.8 billion yuan on the construction of an artificial smart technology park, which will be built and will house more than 400 enterprises that will focus on the development of artificial intelligence technologies from biometrics to auto-pilot vehicles.
Food is also at the heart of many major festivals in China over the years, which are celebrated by foreigners, and spring is one of the most important social and economic festivals and one of the most accessible festivals for foreigners.
"I propose to help Chinese friends prepare for the New Year, and to clean the apartment and the red League with a new year's blessing on the home door. On New Year's Eve, all members of the family will come together to eat a great meal, and then watch until midnight and greet the New Year with a radiant flame."
Reports indicate that the number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but the language barriers in China and the ease of communication among expatriates can easily be used as a pretext for their incomplete integration into local culture.
"Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but have had little experience with their host country.
"In these so-called "foreign bubbles" ("foreign bubbles" means foreigners only hang out among foreigners without contact with local people and local culture — interpreter's note), foreigners hug in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and friends only foreigners.
The simplest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin -- it's easier than people might imagine.
Seth says, "The Chinese private lessons of the last two hours a week or the introductory radio drama should suit everyone's schedule."
Even a few classic short sentences can help shopping, ordering in restaurants or chatting in taxis.
It has been reported that persistent air pollution is also a fact of daily life, but in recent years the Government has tried to contain some problems.
Residents stress the importance of outdoor activities in warm months where pollution is often lighter, using the blue sky as an opportunity to spend time in a long-standing alley or to explore popular solar parks.
And Norton said, "Beijing is a Chinese city that can discover the most things on the surface, and you can find great artistic and musical activities, night-time life, historical wonders, super-modern commercial zones and ancient holocausts."
The report argues that ageing is increasingly a barrier to human capital growth, particularly in the north-east, where the annual average contribution of ageing to human capital growth is -128 per cent.
According to Pan Kwok, the current risks of cross-border capital flows are manageable and underlying factors underpinning the balance of payments remain long-term.
On December 17, the China-News Network launched the International Summit Forum on the Restoration and Conservation of Chinese Ancient Books in 2016 at the People's University of China.
In April of this year, the European Commission accused Google of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to pre-package software such as Google Search and Chrome Browser, otherwise they would not be allowed to use other Google applications.
The EU Commission considers this to be detrimental to the interests of consumers and an obstacle to competition.
The EU regulators initially requested Google to respond by July 27.
If the crime of antimonopoly is established, Google faces a fine of up to 10 per cent of its global revenues, amounting to about $7.4 billion.
Google hasn't commented on it yet.
Google is also facing an EU investigation because of the search results in favour of home shopping services.
Zhang Yu Ning's legacy is real, and it can be said that it was no accident that he achieved "stepping" from the Qing to the Olympics, and that he was still on a surprising leap.
A picture of Bitcoin's legal status around the world.
Summary: In addition to the natural price-backs triggered by speculative properties, the fall of the current round of digital currency is also related to the "mixed enemy" - regulatory risk.
From the visual map, the Eastern countries are more conservative than the West, and the countries that dominate the world are still looking at digital monetary legitimacy, representing the "black swan risk" that remains high.
* This is from a Wall Street interview (microid:wallstreetcn), edited by Wang Mu. For more wonderful information, please visit Wallstreetsn.com or download a Wall Street interview APP.*
With regulatory storms in major Bitcoin markets such as China, Korea and the European Union, the global digital currency headed by Bitcoin has been bled out since this week, and bitcoin prices have fallen by $10,000 on Tuesday, with the largest single-day fall in three years.
In addition to the natural price-backs triggered by speculative properties, the fall of the current round of digital currency is also related to the constant "enemy" - regulatory risk.
At this critical juncture, the big visual data site HowMuch.net has produced a map showing the legitimacy and regulation of Bitcoin across the globe.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legitimate market of bitcoin; orange yellow represents the neutral market, although it has not publicly legalized bitcoin status, but there are no major restrictions on its use; light pink represents the restricted market, where local governments try to use digital currency by means of red-line policies or regulation; dark pink represents the country where bitcoin is defined as illegal; grey is the country that has not yet been evaluated.
(Supreme map from HowMuch.Net visualization team, 15 January)
According to the article, the traditional attitude of the Eastern countries of Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West, as can be seen from the distribution of green pieces in Central Africa.
Russia is currently the largest country to define Bitcoin as illegal, China as one of the largest restricted markets in Bitcoin, and India as one of the largest countries to have not yet adopted a relevant policy.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of bitcoin, i.e. more concentrated distribution of green pieces.
In the Middle East and Latin America, there is a marked divergence of views between the different countries of the region, and the colours of the above-mentioned regions are more mixed.
Among them were Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil and the legitimate Bitcoin market, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia, among others, where there was a degree of restriction on their trade and use, and more Latin American countries, which had not spoken.
A combination of the above data shows that 99 (or 40 per cent) of the 246 countries in the world are free of restrictions on transactions and use of bitcoin, i.e. green and orange.
Seven countries (or 3 per cent) are restricted markets (light pink), 10 countries (or 4 per cent) define bitcoin as illegal (deep pink), and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) do not treat digital currency information (grey) more.
This suggests that countries that make up the global majority (53 per cent, more than half) are still looking at the legitimacy of digital currency headed by bitcoin in the country, and that the "black swan risk" of bitcoin remains high, as some of them may eventually make legislative decisions to limit digital currency.
According to the article, the emerging category of digital currency is not fully understood by global regulators and may be the main reason why most countries have not yet made a pronouncement.
Although Bitcoin's "humanism" has increased exponentially since last year, it does not represent an interest for all countries, and some countries may fear that local French currency will be threatened as a result, or more so that digital money will be used by criminal organizations.
Wall Street News has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news against Bitcoin since last week, including China's launch of a centralized online service platform against off-site exchanges and the move of App. Korea is still considering closing the digital currency exchange. The EU believes that bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of "compensation to the bloodbath".
The editor-in-chief of Wall Street selects "Big read" 2018: Global Ma's Opening Digital Currency Year?" It was mentioned that 2018 will be the Global Central Bank's Digital Currency Year either from the point of view of regulation, acceptance/criticisation, adoption.
The way big countries like Russia criticize the legal status of bitcoin is also intended to give way to the official issuing of digital currency.

The White House in Trump is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most definite sign of regime change is when they start attacking statues.
So Saddam Hussein of Paradise Square in Baghdad was deliberately pushed down in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key thinkers of the Trump government, knew what would happen when Jim Acosta, the Cable News Network (CNN), argued fiercely about the President's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
If he does, a group of cruise owners and liberal followers will eat him alive.
But he did attack the meaning of the statue, especially when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was inscribed on the base in 1903 (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller denounced Acosta, "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of freedom in the United States...
The poem you're referring to was added later, not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
In fact, Miller was right, but, as he said, it's not really about history.
This relates to the modern echo of the language of Lazarus, the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowd of people who want to breathe freely,/the suffering reject your crowded beaches."
There's no "suffering man refusing" at a time when our screens are becoming sharper.
Miller didn't do literary reviews, and he made it clear that these people were not welcome in the Trump era in America.
This conflict over the meaning of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, and her friends whose poems were engraved on the base after her death, were well aware of the highly political nature of the acts in which they were involved.
The purpose of the sculpture is to express the link between French and American republicanism by the ancient classic metaphor of the feminized body of the Statue of Liberty.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poem, the image of a woman is no longer abstract, she has to speak.
She gave herself a very different name: the exile mother.
This poem, combined with this painting, was a successful feminist coup d'état and a devastating blow to American nativeism.
Just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers always wanted it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker, Rush Limbaugh, a temporary Baptist from Trump, argued in 2010 that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, but that now he was an early neoconservative who brought America's intellectual flame to a world of ignorance: "The Statue of Liberty is unprovoked."
She meant to bring the torch of freedom from America to the rest of the world.
The torch is not the path of America. "
What's unusual is that Lindbergh was actually touched by something.
The significance of the statue depends entirely on the perception.
Lazarus' imagination is to be able to see it... when weary, poor, but hopeful people are able to see it on the deck after a long and often terrible journey.
On the face of it, it's about the world's perspective of those who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statues convey to them the hope and welcome they need to hear.
Of course, that's not what Miller and Trump wanted to admit.
Their torches are not intended to light the way, but to ignite hatred from their only source of power.

The 2017 World Cup: Neil Black highly praised Scotland's team in the British National Team.
Eilidh Doyle remembered that there were only two Scots on the British National Team.
Neil Black, Executive Director of the British Athletics Association, said that the 16-strong Scottish team in the World Cup would make a huge contribution to the National Team.
The number of Scottish field athletes selected for the London track World Cup in 2017 was the highest in history.
Black thinks "Scotland is making an extraordinary development," from which British trackers have to learn.
"We accept and try to understand this, and we will persevere until we succeed, " says Black.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's about what they're doing.
Scottish trackers think it's about what they're doing.
The British Athletics Association thinks it's about what they're doing.
Even street people think so.
No matter what happens, it's brilliant. "
Many Scottish trackers are medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be at 5,000 meters with Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle is selected as the team leader.
"Erid is a little modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible. " Black said...
"Many trackers, whether or not they are Scottish, or whether they live or train anywhere, walk out of the house with pride and energy.
The passions and genuine feelings that Eric naturally put into it are very good. "
This Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will be in his fifth World Series 400 meters cross-column contest, says there are 16 Scottishs in the British National Team, which is "unbelievably."
Previously, the number of Scottish track athletes participating in the World Series was up to seven, which is the number of participants in the competitions in 1983 and 2015.
In the past year, she has made five British records and two European records.
She's going to compete for 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who participated in the 1,500-metres race, was another notable Scottish player who had achieved great results in the season, winning the British pre-selections and the Olympic anniversary, respectively.
Doyle remembered her participation in the first world championship, when the only other Scottish in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said that she was very proud that so many of her compatriots would not only join the team, but also, in some cases, challenge the medals and race to the finals.
"The special thing about being a captain of the National Team is that it was elected by the other members of the National Team.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots.
It's just how far we've gone.
And they're all old trackers here, trackers who're about to move towards the goal of the Medal.
How was my captain's speech?
Well, I think it's great.
I've just referred to the fact that, under these circumstances, we're very lucky because we're holding a World Cup in the main arena.
That's why it's really important that we grow up with home-based support and by returning to the Olympic stadium.
I will be given a second chance to compete, and the atmosphere will be wonderful. "

To block critics on Facebook: if you cannot stand the blame of voters, don't run for office.
Our father knows the bad media.
The Americans loved Washington, but soon after all the major newspapers began to speak out against him, from domestic policy to political principles.
He's upset about these criticisms, no doubt.
But he didn't silence those critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of expression is denied -- we will be slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance."
That reminds me of Larry Hogan, Governor of Maryland, who needs to study in Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and removed at least 450 people's posts because they made their views known on his Facebook home page.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union brought a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff considered the lawsuit imprudent and the online coverage was full of their strong resistance: "Who cares?"
A lot of people say, "It's just Facebook."
But it's important.
This is particularly important because people like Hogan are confronted.
It's a Republican governor in a state with a democratic majority, and he's miraculously popular.
Of the country's 50 governors, he's ranked second.
Hogan's not a reactionary rash.
He's in charge of Maryland. He's in strict compliance with the rules.
He's also very good at Facebook as the main way to communicate with voters, showing his face on the home page for the first time after chemotherapy.
So it's completely unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block the people who come to the governor's home page, which is a public forum, an official management platform for public tax-funded employees.
In an interview with the Washington Post, the spokesperson for Hogan, Amelia Chaz, defended the Governor's actions, saying she believed that he was just trying to block their comments.
But they were too hasty to describe it as a flood beast or cynicic who swept through the network.
The Washington Post spoke face-to-face with people who were blocked by Hogan.
They're just ordinary people talking to their chosen leaders: they're teachers, small business owners and priests, not some flood beast.
They say their comments are deep, respectable and not dirty.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Salma Lamani, a barrister in Bowie, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked about hate crimes.
She wrote in the news story review section of the Washington Post, "I'm very polite to comment that I'm disappointed that he did not respond to hate crimes and other recent news incidents.
I also don't like a bunch of people commenting on the same subject because they're simply ignored by some, who think they're so-called psychoactive rather than treating them as citizens of a concerned nation ... "
The Governor's staff called the intensive spam bombing arguably "convincing".
The Facebook era made it easy to change a message, just to block a critics or delete a negative comment.
And it was much cleaner than it was in the past, when the same effect had to be achieved by sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical comments or by arresting or squeezing protesters.
But that's what's happening right now, just at the digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be blamed for scolding people on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being prosecuted by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
There was a landmark ruling last week in Virginia about this kind of thing.
According to the District Judge of Alexandria, James c. Katcharis of the United States, the Chairman of the Lauden County Supervisory Board has violated the First Amendment by blocking voters from her Facebook page.
The state governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevan (R), was also visited by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the Internet had similar influences.
The number of newspapers has quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, with anonymous letters criticising his leadership.
And even then, Washington had an anonymous flood beast against him.
People used the pseudonyms of Julikla, Valerius, Belissarius and Porgius to write to newspapers to criticize Washington's decision-making harshly.
According to historical documents collected by George Washington newspaper online, his office was flooded with petitions criticizing his attitude to the British treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation between His Majesty the King of England and the United States of America.
But he didn't scold them.
Freedom of expression, dissent and speech are the foundations of this country.
And true leaders need to accept that.
The wind and the wind of the city hold on to people's sensitive nerves.
Limited purchases are a hard bar for many urban property management policies.
In May 2017, Zinan introduced a policy whereby undergraduates are entitled to the same purchase policy as residents of the local permanent household for six consecutive months;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy whereby university students can be registered with a diploma and an employment certificate within three years of graduation.
The policy was then added, with the official saying that "university students can buy a house at less than 20 per cent of the market price".
In July, Chengdu introduced a rule that young people with undergraduate and higher degrees in universities in the field could apply for a residence permit in Chengdu.
In addition to this, there are other cities or regions in Kunshan, such as Shanghai, where there is a "brain-in-the-job" policy that lowers the threshold for home ownership.
Zhang Xiang believes that it is actually the big cities that compete for people, especially people, and retain people, especially people, to be competitive, which is the most important of these real estate policies.
Some even think that this means that the time has come for the city to cancel.
The director said on that day that the film was planned for a long time, that the first script was edited in 1999 and that he was even looking for the Golden City Wu to play Yin XIII.
Ronan Lafferty looks forward to having a homecoming at the Renaissance Club.
The East Lothean Renaissance Club holds the 25th Scottish Springs Open Competition, and Ronan Lafferty, the former European champion, will enjoy coming home in the next three days.
This Northern Irish man led Archerfield Links next door to the finals last year, but he finally lost to Paul Els. He now works for the new venue, representing Jerry Salvatti, founder and CEO of the club, as the ambassador of the race.
Lafferty said, "I witnessed the creation of the Renaissance Club, and we will witness its glory through this game.
The athletes will see the best face and state of the field.
Jerry created this place incredibly.
He's a passionate supporter of the game and is very proud of what he's done here.
This is the best stage to show this field."
Englishman Iles looks forward to the first crown, although in 32 years of his career, he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
The sportsman from Shosbolt says, "This is really special.
I didn't defend Extremadura's public competition because it was cancelled in the second year I won.
It's amazing to be here.
It's wonderful to play golf here.
Last year's memories came to light, and for me and my wife Sharon, the victory last year meant something to us.
It's really a special memory, and we'll always remember it. "
Back to their homeland, Gary Orr, who was just 50 years old earlier this year, then took part in the European Youth Tour.
This is his first competition in Scotland since the 2013 Golf Open.
Helensburger Orr says, "Go home is always more meaningful than it is."
You want to be good; but you can feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed being in the game again. I've been playing golf.
I'm satisfied with the current situation. "

The Director-General of the Environment Inspectorate of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China introduced in Beijing, in August, 57 cases of continuous daily punishment throughout the country, and the new amendment to the Environmental Protection Act introduced earlier this year clearly added to China's environmental enforcement efforts.
At present, environmental protection agencies in all parts of China can use the daily and continuous punishments of seizure, lock-down of births and transfer to administrative detention to investigate environmental offences and cooperate with the judicial authorities to punish environmental offences.
According to the Chief People of Zou, during the month of August, a total of 335 cases were closed and seized throughout China; 177 cases were suspended; 189 were transferred to administrative detention and 166 were transferred to alleged environmental pollution offences.
Of these, Henan has imposed seven consecutive daily penalties, and China is now in the process of infusing it from the end of control to full-scale environmental pollution control.
Despite the downward pressure on the economy, China's Ministry of the Environment had previously made it clear that China should properly address the positioning of environmental protection in economic development, enhance its "green force" and move at a slower pace than the economy can relax environmental protection and optimize environmental protection for the economy.

Russian media say Putin will own a new car: 15% less per unit than Mercedes.
The Russian media reported on January 18 that Russian Minister of Industry and Trade Mantourov said that President Putin's "car fleet" had a unit price of 6-7 million roubles.

The Minister said, "From next year, all interested people can order, either bulletproof or luxury, without any restrictions on sales."
The Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade plans to increase the annual production of the "car fleet" series to over 1,000 vehicles after 2020.
Mantourov said, "We're full of 18 now, and this year we're full of more than 70, 200 next year and 300 or more next year."

Our first star in the space science satellite series and the world's first dark matter particle detection satellite.
Over the last two years of orbiting, four scans were conducted of the entire space, detecting more than 35 billion high-energy particles and acquiring the most accurate particles in the world.

You don't have to use your nose to find a bathroom now.
Not just the hardware, but the software.
The tourism sector requires toilet paper and hand-washing fluids to be attached to the toilet in the view area.
But there are some areas.
Is it because of the uncivilised behavior of individual people that this civilian service is stopped?
Managers everywhere have made choices.
On the one hand, we're promoting savings through civilizational tips, and on the other hand we're doing technological innovation.
In the public toilet in Jiang Sulnanjing, Cebu, etc.
You'll get a free toilet paper for three seconds, but it'll take another 10 minutes to get a double.
Avoiding misuse of public resources
It's a habit, maybe some tourists are trying to get the paper back, but on the other hand, we have to reflect.
Isn't the next toilet we're going to have no paper? So that's what we're focusing on in the new three-year plan.
It's not enough to solve this imbalance.
To push the toilet revolution deeper is to think more about what people think.
There must be a third bathroom for the family to accompany the elderly and the children to the bathroom.
We have the baby. We have the men's room. We're embarrassed to come in.
The girls' room is so small that it's a little awkward. The board is so comfortable that it's so convenient for us to bring the kids.
In the countryside, villagers in the Guangxi river pool are building new flush toilets in their homes.
There has been a great deal of success in actively promoting the toilet revolution not only to keep people away from disease, but also to drive economic development to narrow the regional development gap.
This toilet problem is an outline problem, a node for social development.
It's a national civilizational project that guides the layout from a national perspective and then solves small social problems from different levels of participation.
That's how we get all our shorts.

The Senate of the United States voted for a massive tax reduction bill on the second floor.
Analysis suggests that this marks a step closer to the Trump government and the Republican Congress than the completion of America's largest tax reduction programme in 30 years.

Poverty and death in Indonesia.
Baddina Dejé doesn't have a stove when she cooks.
She doesn't even use pots.
Her cabin is located in Einarotali, the capital of Panie district, Papua, Indonesia, where the housewife usually simply puts a potato — the natives call it "nota" — directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the burnt potato was taken out by an unwashed hand and eaten by the wolves.
Dejay sits on the mud -- she doesn't have furniture, and this is where she does daily household chores, like washing clothes, washing water is so thick, it's all from nearby swamps.
There's a bucket in a room without a roof. This is an outdoor toilet.
She's the youngest of the four wives of her husband, so she's not taken care of in the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course it's dangerous to work late: most men in the village don't work and many are drunk and there's plenty of soldiers here.
She said, "No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.."
This is a rare glimpse of everyday life in the Highlands of Papua, a colony of the Netherlands that was incorporated into Indonesia after a referendum in 1969, which was also controversial when only 1026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands in front of the army occupying the area.
There is a strong demand for independence, and the campaign against Dutch rule will soon be directed again at the Jakarta government, which exercises high-handed rule over the region and isolates foreign journalists and defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is remote and deserted; it takes 90 minutes from the provincial capital, Jayapura, to go to Nabyre and rent a car for five hours, and to go all the way to the sea.
There's no public transport here.
In this town of approximately 19,000 people, the wooden house is surrounded by bamboo fences, and the wrinkled iron roofs are all kinds of rusty brown covers.
Few Indonesians come, let alone journalists, and few foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here.
Djay said, "We don't wear these clothes. " She means her colored turban, her dark shirt and her beautiful half skirt.
"We used to cover our bodies with leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and is the region with the highest infant mortality rate and lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But this is also the gold continent of Indonesia.
The largest and most lucrative gold mine in the world, Glasberg, is only 60 miles from here, owned by Felipe McMollan Copper Gold, based in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Felipe mined around $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, the timber resources in Papua are very rich, with an estimated value of $780 billion.
But these vast resources are also the source of the tragedy of the Papuan people, which is why Indonesia's powerful military forces have been able to silence them.
According to a 2005 New York Times survey report, Felipe paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 for one official alone.
The growing demand of the Papuans for independence threatens the gold master and is thus subjected to cruel treatment.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the Highlands of the Papua tribe in the 1970s escalated into genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A report by the Catholic Brisbane General parish in 2016, "We will lose everything" , contains evidence of the perfidious acts of the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture — another report that rape and electrocution are particularly common — and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
Human Rights Watch Indonesian researcher Andrias Harsono said, "The violence occurs every day, and it is difficult to calculate the number of victims. "
Babouya's resources brought in large numbers of immigrants outside Indonesia, and oppression began.
Eighty-three per cent of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but the demographic structure of Muslim economic immigrants has changed since their arrival in the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Javans' snack stand sells a mixture of fried chicken and vegetables with peanut butter.
The locals struggled.
24-year-old Abbos Yu moved to the provincial capital Jayapura to find work, explaining that "those immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market at a lower price than the local Papuans.
This has caused the local Papuan — mama-mama — to lose their market. "
The President of Indonesia, Zoko Widodo (known as Zokovi), vowed to address the inequality and abuse of power in Papua during his 2014 campaign.
The former carpenter's road to the Jakarta Presidency was supported by 27 of the 29 districts, including Panai.
But Papua hasn't changed anything. Today, the locals feel betrayed.
You said, "We've broken our hearts, and in 2014 we voted for Zokovi, hoping that he will live up to our aspirations and restore justice."
In fact, only two months after Zokovi took office in October, Panai had the worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, Enarotali 11 children sang Christmas hymn in front of a campfire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly came on a motorcycle.
The frightened kids told them to turn on the headlights.
According to the local priest, Avette Tebai, one of the soldiers was unhappy with their tone and then came back with four soldiers.
The victims and witnesses said that the drunk soldiers were chasing the kids with their guns.
One of the soldiers then shot the children.
16-year-old Urianus Yemmer was unconscious because of severe beatings.
A few hours later, there was a fire in the nearby government agency Election Commission building, and the next day the incident escalated.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
They danced the waita of the Baboua Mee Pago tribe with their ritual bows -- running around and imitating birds.
Some protesters started throwing stones at regular military posts.
According to an official document seen in Times magazine, when the mood continued to intensify, soldiers received orders via internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot immediately." But this document was not released to the local media.
The 56-year-old Jeremiah Kayamu, the leader of the Enerotali Kego Koto neighbourhood, felt the imminent danger and appealed to the crowd to calm down and beg them to return home.
But no one's in the mood to listen to him.
He stood on the porch of his beautiful cabin and told Times that when I turned back, my left wrist was shot. "
Kayamu still doesn't know who fired the gun, but he says the bullets came from a group of soldiers.
And he said, "It was crowded and they fired a lot."
According to the cousin of the local Alfous Juul, he witnessed the shooting and saw Alfyus Yure shot three times.
Juhanes sadly told Times magazine that I ran over to check his body to see if it was him.
I found him dead and I kissed him. "
Inspector General of the Papua Police, Yuji Mende, told reporters that his subordinates were only at the "protective" police station because the police station had been attacked.
In 2015, Puggio Sulistio, police spokesman for Papua, said, "When someone threatens to kill us, we have to defend ourselves.
It's a matter of life and death. "
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The next day news of the killing spread only slowly in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovi gave a well-spoken speech in Jayapura, expressing deep sympathy to the families of the victims and vowing to address the abuse of power left over from the history of Papua.
He said, "I hope this case is settled as soon as possible so that this will not happen again in the future."
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Valando, called for a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuse for exoneration is almost immediate.
He said, "Most of the violations took place a long time ago.
Some were in the '90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but this will require a process ... "
And then on June 5th, in Jakarta, in a conversation with Times magazine, Verando went back, saying that he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be settled in accordance with the law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Verando for "crimes against human rights" in the 1999 bloody independence vote in East Timor, but he says that 11 cases of human rights violations in the Papua region have been resolved, including the Panai incident.
The families of the victims of the Panii incident are scorning these statements.
Juhanes said, "I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't progressed at all."
Years later, he said, "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army, of being shot. "
His brother, Yukabus, also believes that Pani's people are afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury the four victims.
He said, "After burying the body, the military came to me."
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in Deyai County, Pani-Ai-Neighbourhood.
A manager of a construction company refused to help transport a unconscious man to the hospital, clashed, one man died and 17 others were injured, including children.
A 24-year-old man, Lavianus Dowu, drowned while fishing near the river and died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company's field office.
The police said the villagers threw stones at the police, so the police fired warning shots.
But the riot squad started shooting at the crowd and one man was killed.
29-year-old Dominguez Buddy told the Times magazine, "We were panicking and now we're afraid they'll get revenge."
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Parliament of Deyay has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and for the mobile anti-riot forces to be withdrawn from the area.
Panai has always been a place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has given rise to discontent among the peoples of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, which are scattered in the central highlands of Pani Ain.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the Papuans by spreading attacks and kidnapping Indonesian soldiers by surprise.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua Movement were born in Panai, including Tadius Yugi and Daniel Yodas Kogoa.
As a result, thousands of Pani have been arrested in recent years by the military under the guise of "preservation of national sovereignty" and deliberately detained.
Some people never show up again.
In the eyes of Papuans, Panai is a forgotten place of tragedy.
Poverty breeds discontent.
Enerotali's selling rice is pathetic, and the locals can't afford it.
There's no way out of here for bread.
People here grow everything they can eat: mostly potatoes and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and every woman can take care of four or five potatoes.
They usually leave most of the harvests for writers and sell the rest on the local market.
Ten potatoes worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has spread among the local Papuans and new immigrants, whose numbers have increased significantly since the opening of the new route to Nabyre Airport.
The few jobs available are usually in the hands of better educated and richer immigrants.
Papuans have little money or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
John Gobe, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council, said, "Young people don't want to stay in this village because there's no job or money here."
Papua is isolated from the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Lonshan were expelled from Papua because they were "not cooperating with the authorities", even though they rarely had authorization to film.
According to the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch Asia, Felim Kane, the election vows by Zokovi to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
In a statement, he said, "If foreign journalists try to cover the most disgruntled provinces of Indonesia, Papua and West Papua, they are at new risk: denial of visas and blacklisting. "
The absence of media oversight means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the neighbouring countries of Papua.
In March, 6 Pacific countries — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands — asked the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate Papua's “various types of widespread human rights violations”, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua Movement.
The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Armanata Nasir, who was not concerned about the charges against the group, told journalists in Jakarta that " Indonesia is still in the midst of democratic institutions and freedom of the media, so evidence of human rights violations is difficult to cover up ... "
The locals want more foreign government attention.
According to an informed source, on 4 May, when the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights, Keith Van Barr, led an official delegation to Jayapura, the local people broke the silence and cried out "We wanted freedom." He also attended the meeting, but asked for anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say that they are unlikely to vote for Zokovi again.
The Chairman of the Tribal Council, Gobai, said, "Zokovi's intentions are good, but he's surrounded by people involved in the Panai shooting."
He wanted to let Zokowi know that the people of Panai lived under the threat not only of a greedy army but also of nothing, that the region was poorly educated and that public health services were scarce.
Gobi says that the people of Paniai, like the other Papuans, think that the vote they voted for Zokovi is his debt.
He said, "They don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting made their last symbolic resistance: burying a victim's body opposite the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
Ukabus fell down and said, "My family was killed.
What else can we do?"
Sofia, Hollywood, and other brands are using capital power to customize the home sector. On 10 February 2017, the China Censorship Board approved an initial application from Guangdong Sang-hwan Mansions and Homes Co. Ltd. to hand over a permit to market the small and medium-sized boards of residence, after more than 20 days of residence in Europe just passed by IPO.
Industry has argued that, with the matching of houses and the subsequent listing of European households, the custom-based home area that was in the air would shift from product competition to capital competition.
At the beginning of the new year, a typical brand-based home allocation in the area of custom home was about to be marketed, attracting the attention of the entire household industry.
According to Reuters, 9 Beijing Time, Samsung Electronics released on Tuesday the first set of autopilot components developed jointly with Harman International, as well as an information and entertainment solution, an important initiative of the company to enter the electronic market for military vehicles.
Three star electronics acquired Haman International about a year ago.
At the Consumer Electronics Fair (CES) in Las Vegas this week, Samsung issued collision alerts, traffic diversion alerts, cruise control cameras, which were developed in cooperation with Haman.
Three Stars plans to start this year's delivery of the camera system, built on technology such as automatic machine learning and scaling-up.
The Three Stars also showed "digital cockpit", and even if the driver was not the owner, it would make the vehicle more personal, as the system would allow users to download the driver's information from mobile devices and clouds.
Tonight, the 20th regular race of the CBA is about to begin, which means the second half of the CBA tournament in the 2016-2017 season.
Once again, the fire swallowed the Dubai Torch Tower.
On Friday, a fire in one of the highest residential buildings in the world in Dubai forced hundreds of residents to flee the high building 337 m, 79 floors.
It's the second fire in just two years to sweep up the high building, and it happens to happen in the sky tower known as the torch.
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported and no cause of the fire has yet been identified.
"We were sleeping, and then we woke up by fire, and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs, ran down from 50 floors, and it took about 10 minutes, and a resident named George told Reuters.
According to the civil defence authorities in Dubai, the fire brigade extinguished the fire around 4 p.m. local time and is in the process of cooling the building.
The Government has indicated that it is working to provide shelter for those affected.
This accident could once again raise concerns around the world about the safety of the use of outer-wall materials in high-rise buildings.
An investigation conducted by the skyscraper management after the fire in 2015 found that most of the damaged objects were decorated and insulated on the outer wall.
The British police have indicated that they believe that the problem with the insulation and overboard system at the Glenfield Building in London may have caused the rapid spread of the June fire, which caused the death of about 80 people.
The Williams convoy also suggested that Massa might return, even though he had announced his retirement.
On 9 January, just one month before the opening of the Korean Ping Chang Winter Olympics, the country ' s winterly atmosphere grew stronger as the Olympic fire spread from south to north and preparations intensified.
Korean public opinion expects this long-neighbored inter-Korean talks to bring an egg to Ping Chang Winter Olympics in a month's countdown.
On November 1, last year, the Ping Chang Winter Olympic Communion fire arrived in Korea.
The heat of the fire is reflected directly in the sale of tickets for the Ping Chang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, the Ping Chang Winter Olympics tickets were sold at only 32 per cent, the Winter Paralympics at 4.3 per cent, and the low ticket sales rate was once a source of concern for the people of Ping Chang Winter Olympics.
But as Lee Heefan, Chairman of the Ping Chang Winter Olympic Organizing Committee, predicted to the press a short time ago, "As the Olympic Winter War spread across Korea, the Winter Olympics became increasingly hot, believing that the sales of tickets would soon improve."
According to Korean media reports, as of 3 January, the Ping Chang Winter Olympics ticket sales had reached 64%, and the Winter Paralympics ticket sales rate was 50%.
In an effort to encourage foreigners to go to Han Xinxi, the Korean Ministry of Justice also announced on 8th that foreigners visiting Korea would be granted an extension of their stay in Korea for up to 120 days.
The investigation found that more than one fifth of American travellers boarded the plane with prohibited items.
A survey of aircraft passengers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had boarded the aircraft through the U.S. Transportation and Security Administration checkpoint, intentionally or unintentionally, and that at least 6 per cent of those passengers had boarded the plane unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
Less than 1% of passengers claimed that they later discovered that they were travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
This investigation of more than 1,000 people was carried out by the charter services company Stratos Jet Charterers Inc. The investigation also found that young travellers were more likely to blatantly ignore the rules.
19.7% of the respondents who admitted having attempted to board TSA prohibited items were the Millennium Generations, compared to 15% of the X Generations.
The most common items that pass through TSA security officers are food and drinks.
More than 3% admitted having intentionally carried the blades through security, while 2.2% of the female respondents and 3.7% of the male respondents also said that they had boarded the plane intentionally carrying the prohibited drugs.
The company claims that the investigation of the national travellers was carried out in order to find out the number of people who had boarded the aircraft by accident and intentionally carrying embargoed goods.
It's not surprising that the people most likely to carry embargoed goods through security checks — intentionally or unintentionally — are those who fly most frequently.
However, it points out that the TSA guide is a bit complicated and difficult to understand.
People don't usually know what and how much liquid they can carry.
So it's not surprising that TSA caught the most illegal liquid.
It was once thought that TSA might have used books as an embargo.
Internal flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed to carry them.
U.S. EPA Prute changed his mind about Obama's time-era emissions reduction regulations.
One day after being prosecuted by 15 states, the Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Pruitt changed his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of Obama's era regulations to reduce emissions of smokey air pollutants.
Prute proposed this change because the Environmental Protection Agency can respond more quickly to the needs of state agencies that regulate the environment than the previous government.
He didn't mention the legal challenges brought by the Federal Court of Appeal against his former position.
The debate focused on setting October 1 as the deadline for states to start meeting the 2015 terrestrial ozone standard.
In June, Prute announced that he would delay compliance for a year in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid "disturbing local decision-making or impeding economic growth".
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Prutt was the State Attorney of Oklahoma and has long opposed the tightening of environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Prute has repeatedly turned to preventing or delaying regulations against the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal obstacle to Prute's return to the agenda.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the Director of Environmental Protection had exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration ' s requirement that oil and gas companies monitor and mitigate methane leakages ...
In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Prute suggested that his attitude towards the ozone standard was a big shift, and that he would strengthen the commitment of the Environmental Protection Agency to work with the states to adopt complex procedures to reach new standards.
Prute said, "Under previous government administration, EPA usually did not meet the prescribed deadline, and then waited for radical groups and others to sue and then agreed to set a specified timetable by agreement." "He initiated more than a dozen prosecutions against EPA in his previous work.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation. We take deadlines seriously.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously. "
Nevertheless, the EPA statement states that Prutt may again use his "extension authorization and all other legally available authorizations" to ensure that the provisions are consistent with "good policy and best available information".
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewriting of the ozone layer regulations.
The House Bill approved last month was intended to delay the 2015 rule by at least eight years.
This measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.
The New York State Attorney, Eric Schneiderman, led the state union this week to sue the US EPA for its intention to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said, "The reverse of the US EPA -- after we filed a lawsuit -- was an important victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with more than 115 million American communities directly affected by smoke emissions."
California, Connecticut, Deloitte, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C., joined New York.
Ground-based ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants from cars, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources to sunlight exposure in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause severe respiratory problems for sensitive populations, causing thousands of premature deaths every year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered for Prute's amazing transformation.
Lori Ann Bird of the Biodiversity Center says: "It is disturbing that this common sense measure is under great pressure from the heads of the departments that protect the air we need to breathe."
"We must fight at the end of the Trump government ' s intellectual movement to cater to the polluters and special interest groups ... "
In addition to the external factors of steel heating, businesses are also struggling on their way to lower costs.

Recently, Japan's animation of "Your Name" went to Asia, and after becoming Miyazaki's director, the film broke 20 billion yen for the first time in 15 years and took the second place in the ticket room.
Since the second half of 2009, the sales of Xiaoshan Flowerwood have remained high, especially since this spring, when the sale of Xiaoshan's seedlings rose again to record high levels, and prices rose sharply. According to statistics, the revenue from the sale of Xiaoshan's trees increased by 48 per cent from the same period in January to June this year, with the largest increase in nearly 20 years.
The Deputy Director of the Xiaoshan Forest Department, Xiaohai Yong, said that, with good marketing, Xiaoshan Hanaki production had also developed faster.
In the last two years, the area under Xiaoshan felled to 30,000 acres, totalling 180,000 acres, while at the same time actively moving out of the area, Xiao Ming farmers established 80,000 acres of flowerwood bases throughout the country, an increase of 30,000 acres over 2008.
In parallel with the expansion of the area under cultivation, the quality of seedlings has been improving, the value of nurseries has been increasing, large specifications, high-quality seedlings have been retained and part of them have been sold.
Shiraito also warned that, in the face of the current boom, producers should face it calmly and objectively, recognizing that society ' s demand for flowers will be long-term and increasing, while recognizing that the market will be more competitive.
On the morning of 13 July Beijing Time, Somaltus United States filed a lawsuit in the Eastern Texas District Court against Apple for violating a battery technology patent it applied for in 2010.
The same patent was used by the company to sue Hashimoto, Tristar, Sonny and Toshiba.
The lawsuit alleged that both iPhone 6s and similar apple equipment had violated US patent 7,657,386, the patent entitled Integrated Battery Services.
The plaintiff sought compensation in cash or a patent fee for tort equipment after the judgement was pronounced.
From the indictment, the plaintiff appears to believe that the fast-filled function of the iPhone violated the company's patent.
An iPhone with a fast-filled function will quickly charge up to 80% of the charge and then trickle up the charge.
Somaltus is actually a so-called patent gangster, because it doesn't provide obvious products and services and it's hard to find information online.
However, they have successfully settled this patent out of court with car manufacturers such as Ford and Japanese.
The meeting recognized the importance of accelerating information-based development, promoting resource interconnection, efficient use, increasing industrial digitization, intelligence, promoting "China's production of 2025" and mass entrepreneurship, creating innovation, nurturing new energy and improving the quality of life of the population.

According to leaked telephone records, Trump had pressured Mexico to pay for the construction of the border.
The Washington Post has leaked the minutes of the conversation between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly stating that he would not pay for the proposed boundary wall.
It was reported that the President of the United States had expressed dissatisfaction with his public criticism of the wall, and that he had allegedly been told by Putron: "Don't tell the media. "
During the presidential campaign, Trump promised to build the separation wall on the southern border of the United States and solemnly announced that Mexico would pay for the project.
The records of his conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which showed an intense exchange between them, were also published.
Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. undertaking the refugee transfer to Australia was "preposterous", "disgusting" and "intelligent," that he had suggested that the U.S. ban the resettlement of refugees, and now insisting on the deal brokered by the Obama administration, which would make him look like a fool.
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull that this was the most unpleasant call of the day.

The Moor Beach tragedy: Racist lynchings by activists for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car ran through a crowd of viewers in the town of Monroe, Georgia, and ran towards a little moor beach bridge.
The car was carrying four black passengers and a white driver, and a group of white men with guns blocked the road ahead of the bridge.
The head of these thugs - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - took a deep breath of cigars and looked into the windshield.
The passengers in the car are full of fear.
"We want-- Roger!" the man shouted.
"Get him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged down from the passenger seat in the front row and screamed in the silence.
Fortunately, the terrible scene of July 22 was just a repetition.
But, when Roger's neck was covered with ropes, almost all the viewers had a real breath.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moor Beach Bridge, where two black couples -- Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Merre Dossi -- were hanged by three Ks lynchings the night of 1946.
No one's ever been charged with murder.
"Although we know who they are, even though we've seen them in the community, none of them have been arrested over the years, which is incredible." Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize this repetition, said.
"This is the stain of history, the burden of our souls."
7-year-old Brooks, a former member of Georgia's parliament and a lifelong rights activist.
For him, the repetition was a remarkable call to remind the Menro community every year that injustice had never been corrected.
"We want to sue, we want to close, we want to cure, we want to reconcile, but we have to get justice first," he said.
"Until we get justice, we will not be cured and reconciled... "
On July 27, 1946, the coroner laid a sheet on the body of a victim of lynching on Moor Beach.
According to the FBI file obtained by the National Broadcasting Corporation News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of being involved in lynching.
But none of them have ever been charged.
Although suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists have stated that the dual motives for lynchings are well known throughout the town: political and sexual ...
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the first elections later in the summer.
According to the FBI, at about the same time, the black tenant Roger Malcolm stabbed white landlord Barnett Hearst in a fight that looks like it was for a woman.
Brooks says the town rumor is that Hearst slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and her baby wasn't her husband's.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, a well-known white landlord, Roy Harrison, spent $600 bailing Malcolm out of prison.
Dorothy and cousin Michael Murray and George Dorsey went to prison with him.
But when they came back from prison and came to the Moor Beach Bridge, a mob of thugs surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison organized and ordered the murder," an FBI report came to that conclusion.
" It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement authorities, who not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identity of the witness ... "
Brooks is very concise.
He said, "This is a vote tragedy."
"They were killed and the murderer sent a message to the black people in this community: "If you register and vote, you will have the same end."
For the past 10 years Cassandra Green has been in charge of the annual recurrence of the lynchings at the Moor Beach Bridge.
She's a very good-looking, well-meaning woman with a deep racist background, and many people want this racism to cease to exist in the United States.
It's hard not to look, but Green says it's the key.
"We don't want to talk about lynching, because lynching makes us face the ugly face of everyone," she said.
"But if you don't listen to me or hear me tell you what I've been through, I can't have a relationship with you."
This year's show started in June, with nearly 30 actors on the first day - a dozen white people, the rest black people - in a room, listening to Green's rehearsal overview.
Wade Malbau co-director of Greene.
He's been playing the role of the Klan for years, but he says it's never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Malbau said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive, because we don't want to go back to that era. "
In the room, the actors Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hearst, Darius Bradshaw, and Nick Rascona are rehearsing their lines.
At the beginning of this scene, Malcolm shouted and pushed Hester out of his way, angry at him for sleeping with his wife Dorothy.
I said, get out of my house!
Rascona backslide.
And then they fought.
And then everybody started laughing.
Green smiles the most.
"What's the matter?
He's panicking, confused.
Am I out of line?
"No," Green laughed.
"I just don't think white people say 'Aah ' when they fight back."
"Yes," the other black actor plays fun.
"Your tone must be strong."
So, the energy in the room changes; the feeling of love drives away the feeling of discomfort.
Everyone tried to do it not only to perform the show, but also to honour the memory of the four victims.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona said the word "ah" he was sharp and strong.
No one's laughing.
It's a powerful and quick end to the recurrence.
The screams, the shootings, then the silence.
A woman in a funeral black is standing next to the body of an actor, singing Billy Harolde's mournful words, "The strange fruit."
Her voice slammed through the other words.
A hundred yards away, about 40 viewers swirling their sweat and tears.
Blacks and whites make up almost half of the audience.
There's a couple who come to see the show from Isaka, New York, and a lot of people live near the road.
Brooks took them to Malcolm and Dorothy's grave for nearly eight hours, and everyone was suffering from Georgia's uncomfortable wet fever.
But now, on the same land where lynchings took place, there was anxiety in the air.
When the last note of the song disappeared, Green asked people to come closer to the body of the actor.
The children bow down, watch fake blood and corpses, whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy whispering, like a reminder to himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd, and then the show ended.
Actors get rid of the lynching ropes and wipe their tears off.
Bradshaw embraces a man in a suit who plays the Klan leader, Malbau.
Nick Rascona hugged two of his colleagues and wept in their arms; the emotions in the show eventually infected him.
"It's all right," one of the women whispered.
"We know you don't have that inside.
You did it for a reason. "
After that, the audience sat down and had dinner with the actors.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta talked to a black couple they just met, talking about a repetition.
Dennis Duplinski is hard to find words to describe how she feels after watching.
"It's hard to imagine those terrible words and behaviors that people like you say and do because they look like you," she said.
"It really made me think lynching was still going on for me," she added, "Now it's called a cop shooting."
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sits at the table watching, tastes and echoes civil rights.
He said he's already planning next year's show.
"Recurrence is an inspiring way because it describes the horrors we've experienced, but it's also very educational," he said.
"If you don't learn from it, it could happen again.
Those who do not study, who do not know their own history are doomed to repeat their mistakes. "
For natural gas market-based reforms, the importance of "independent network" reforms is self-evident, but resistance and controversy are also greater.
The journalist was informed by Kaiji Hebei Group that an explosion occurred at 11.25 a.m. on 7 a.m. at the Cumber Group Chemical Co. Ltd. ' s emulsion workshop in Tangshan City, Hebei Province, where 13 operators were trapped.
To date, one of the 13 people trapped has been rescued and taken to the hospital, while the remaining 12 are under intense search and rescue.
It is known that the scene has been blocked, local public security, fire, medical and other services are on the scene.
According to witnesses, there was a big bang and a mushroom cloud in time.
According to members of the Open Group, which organized a search and rescue on the ground, Tangshan Kaiqing (Group) Chemical Industries Ltd. is located in the city of Tangshan, Hebei Province, on the north side of Zhao Jiebei, a State-approved site for the production of civilian explosive devices, which was established in 1958 and was originally known as the Six O2 plant of the Open Mining Authority.
Since the news came out 15 years ago, Jay is bound to produce a new album every year, but last year he rarely missed his appointment.

It's been a year and a half since Jayron finally came to Beijing yesterday to present his first father-in-law's first album and his 14th album in his music career, "Jeryn's Pre-Sleep Story of Chow".
US Media: Scientists at China Air Force Engineering University study laser satellites for the removal of space debris
The American media reported on January 18 that Chinese scientists had made a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up the chaotic Earth orbit and destroy old satellites and their sky trash.
According to the United States Newsweek website, January 15, researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled "Study on Space-based Laser Removal Small Scale Space Debris Reorbiting Model", which describes how space debris can be lightened by laser irradiation through the use of space-based platform lasers.
It was reported that space debris had been a concern of the international space agencies for many years and NASA had considered a variety of options for tracking, detecting and removing man-made debris.
The means of removing large-scale space debris include meganets for cleaning and collecting waste, and magnets that can be used to absorb them out of orbit. Chinese scientists conducted laser simulation studies and concluded that this would be an effective way to clean Earth orbit.
The summary of the paper states: "(simulation studies) provide the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based platform laser technologies for the removal of space debris..."
A 2014 study by the United States defence giant Lockheed-Martin found that for satellites operating in orbit, there are about 200 threats per day.
High-speed debris in orbit along the Earth is considered a serious threat to future space missions and has been described by experts from the European Space Agency as "a deadly chain of threats".
Also, according to January 17, January, the American monthly mass machinery website, space is basically empty, but space next to Earth is becoming increasingly crowded. Every satellite that we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris orbiting the Earth and, over time, it will accumulate.
The more debris there is, the higher the probability that a satellite that is still functioning will be hit by debris, thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of dollars.
Reports indicate that all space agencies have plans to clear space debris in the future.
NASA is considering using jet gases to reduce the speed of debris and de-orbit it, Europe is considering launching a satellite with a large net to capture debris and bring it back to Earth, and Japan's idea is to capture debris with an electric chain.
At the moment, China has also proposed a solution to the problem of space debris, namely, the use of a large laser to blow floating space debris into less harmful little pieces.
According to a paper published by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University in the German monthly optical journal, the installation of such a laser on a satellite would be sufficient to clean space effectively, at least according to simulations.
It was reported that the only way to prove effectiveness was to conduct tests and that no such task was currently planned, but perhaps sooner or later someone would install a laser on a satellite and send it into space.
Once it's done, we can finally start ridding space debris once and for all.

On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO statements, there was an explosion on Thursday night, and a joint Afghan-NATO coalition patrol was attacked with an improvised explosive device.
The statement states that all injured persons are currently in stable condition and are being treated at the United States military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
According to journalists, the growing Taliban and so-called Islamic State (IS) organizations in the Karabakh region have raised serious concerns about NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan, compared to approximately 20 per cent in the capital.
A suicide car bomb attack in late July in a Shia-dominated area of Kabul killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban claim they launched this attack.
On 31 May, a massive explosion occurred in the centre of Kabul, killing more than 150 people, the deadliest armed attack in the country since the overthrow of the Taliban by the United States-led multinational force in 2001.
The violence highlighted the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighed whether or not to increase Afghan support for his army and police.
According to journalists, suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also triggered a crisis of public confidence in the Government and its policies, particularly the President Ashraf Ghani.
The United States National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) filed a lawsuit to overturn the resolution and delay the smoke code.
When Obama took office, he made a provision requiring states to curb emissions of all kinds that caused smoke, 15 states, as a result of which the United States National Environmental Protection Agency was prosecuted. One day after the indictment, EPA overturned the provision.
U.S. EPA announced on Wednesday its decision to continue the so-called "Ozone Target 2015" and promised that it would work with the states.
In a statement, Scott Pruitt, Director of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, said, "We have confidence in dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to them. "
Pruit announced in June that the EPA plan to postpone the implementation of the ozone compliance zone standards until October 2018, with a one-year delay - based on the criteria, measurement of existing smoke pollution in some areas to determine which areas should reduce emissions of smoke pollution in order to meet air quality standards.
15 major Democratic states and the District of Columbia filed a suit on Tuesday claiming that the act was illegal.
As part of the broader agenda, the authorities of President Donald Trump have been working to revive the environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama to stimulate economic growth.
But these efforts provoked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups who feared that more emissions would affect public health.
The US EPA website states that breathing ozone-containing air "will reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.

Maggie Garcia and Vasili Lomachenko met for the first time to explore a possible future duel.
The most striking boxing contest of 147 pounds below will take place shortly, and the first meeting on Thursday between Vasili Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia is currently in a state of potential conflict.
In the separate room of the ESPN office in Los Angeles, the World Council of Fighters' lightweight champions, García, took the first step down the corridor to pay tribute to World Boxing's super-feathered champion, Lomachenko.
At the Showtime fight on Saturday, the judge unanimously concluded that García had won the victory of World Champion Adrian Bronner of the four Divisions, and that by doing so, both fighters had become the top five players on the same weight list.
Garcia reached out to his right hand and said, "Chancellor, how are you?
Good luck. "
In the ESPN game on Saturday night at 7:00, Lomachenko won Miguel Mariaga and preserved his position.
When the two of them took pictures, the agent for Lomachenko, Egis Clemás, pointed out that the potential confrontation between the two players depended on the perfect size.
"I used to be lightweight," Garcia Trail.
"I went up to fight Bronner, but I didn't weigh that much.
I'm a little short of weight compared to 140 pounds.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he has to be lightweight (135 pounds) before we can fight.
That's what fans want.
Then we'll meet them. "
Lomachenko agrees.
"The boxing world needs this battle."
Clemás asked whether he should pay the next fee, and part of his strategy was to get Lomachenko to race a 135-pound player later this year for a date to be agreed with Garcia next summer. Garcia was also interested in a match with Jorge Linares-Luc Campbell against the victors of the war after the Forum lightweight boxing contest on September 23rd.
"Because all the fans are asking the question, this fight may be on a fee basis," Garcia said, after that, he expressed his openness to playing on the network offering the best financial program.
"We're the principals.
No one else can get so much attention.
As long as they're ready..."
García appreciates Lomachenko as an excellent player and may be watching his fights on Saturday.
But Lomachenko was hesitant about García, saying he thought the tri-district champion from Riverside looked slow.
Garcia says the point is to show the power of the fist and then the boxing.
They all say they can feel the momentum of their boxing fights.
"This is the battle that has to be fought,
Attention and conversation are beyond the reach of other boxing competitions.
I'd be happy to play, "Jascia says.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for top warriors, this time it's Mikey's turn.
This will be a great battle. "

The early completion of the 11th and 5th emission reduction targets by the officials of the China Development and Reform Commission has given the steel industry, which is constrained by electricity restrictions, a strong expectation of recovery.
Although the steel plant has not received a clear notification from the local government that the energy-saving reduction effort has been completed, it is estimated within industry that, on or about 15 December 2010, the plants that would otherwise have been restricted will be reproducing and the price of the steel will begin to be pressured.
The end of the restriction has not yet been notified, but in fact the pressure on businesses has been much lower than in September, October, when a private steel company in Hebei province told the reporters that it was not possible to stop the production.
The northern part of the river has repeatedly issued restricted production documents and, at one point, has imposed a barrier to business production.
Journalists have learned from local businesses that steel plants in most of Hebei have now resumed work and production restrictions have eased.
My steel network analyst Zhang Tieshan predicts that the end demand for building steel will gradually shift from strength to weakness due to the winter in the north.
With the phasing out of energy-saving emission reductions, by 15 December most steel plants will be largely reproducing and products will arrive in local markets by New Year ' s Eve.
The increase in the supply of resources will put some pressure on the right price of steel.

Publication of the latest results of the Swedish asylum-seeker age assessment test
Swedish asylum-seekers tested using the latest method of medically assessing their age. The latest results show that over 80 per cent of those tested were sentenced to over 18 years of age, but not all of them believed in their accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine (R?ttsmedicinalverket) started this test earlier this year.
After being accused of failing to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees claiming to be minors, the Swedish Migration Board designed these tests with a view to making a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Immigration Service has brought 6880 testers, and the Centre for Forensic Medicine has now published the results of a total of 2481 testers between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
80% (2002 persons) were sentenced to 18 years of age or over, but in 25 other tests, the Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine determined that the subject "may have reached 18 years of age or more".
In 432 tests, the result was that the person "may not be 18 years old".
The test is only for people whose age is in doubt.
According to John Grenson of the Forensic Medicine Center, these results are consistent with the results of the previous months.
He said to The Local: "These data are not very different from those of the previous months, and they are very consistent."
The higher proportion of persons convicted of having reached the age of 18 years or older does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers falsely declare their age.
In May, the Centre published 581 test results, stating that there were 442 "supposing that the testee has reached the age of 18 or more".
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results of the 581 tests released and found that 243 of them had publicly indicated that they would be 18 this year.
An X-ray examination of the mind teeth, an MRI scan of the joints, and then an analysis of the results by dentists and radiologists have also been questioned in some areas.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have reached puberty earlier or later than normal age.
He told the newspaper Metro: "I have reason to think that, and I don't think that's the way to measure it.
It's not accurate to determine the biological age in this way.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can do it. "
However, Granson at the Forensics Center defended the accuracy of these tests: "It can be said, in general, that there is little uncertainty about the risk of determining a child as an adult."
The biggest risk is that this person is under 18 years of age, which is about 10%.
The governor of West Virginia has announced a party change.
Thursday night, Jim Justice announced at President Trump's rally that he would change the party.
"If you like it, if you don't like it, the Democrats have left me." The governor's judge said.
"Today, after a lot of prayers and a lot of thought, I'm going to tell you... today I'm going to tell you, as a West Virginian, that I can no longer help you as a Democratic Governor. "
The rally broke out with cheers.
"So tomorrow, I'll turn the party into a Republican." Justin added.
"As a coach, I'm going to tell you that it's time to start another game."
Trump promised to make a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia earlier.
Mr. Trump won 42% of the vote in West Virginia, while Justin did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justin was selected as the only billionaire in the state in 2016.
Forbes pointed out that he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal mines in five states.
At the moment, he's worth about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Council issued a statement on Thursday evening stating: "Governor Justins' change is another blow to the Democrats, which will not prevent our country from becoming once again great, but will make our country once again great."
" The Democratic Party currently has only 15 governors and controls the State Council at its lowest number ever, and the Governor ' s statement is the latest rejection of a party that has lost leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive unifying slogan " , according to Rona McDaniel, the female president of the Republican National Committee, in a statement to the CBS News.

Sebastian Coe paid tribute to Russia's "truly" apology for the stimulant scandal.
Thursday, the President of the International Federation of Athletics, Sebastian Ko, expressed his appreciation for Russia's apology for the stimulant scandal and said that the apology was very open, but he reiterated that it was not the time for Russia to return to the campaign.
The President of the Russian Association of Athletics, Mitri Chirac, stated at the International Congress of the World Fields on the eve of the World Athletics Championship that his country was right to be banned from participating in the campaign and that he was determined to combat stimulants.
He said he was sorry that "all athletes who won gold and silver medals in the game were deprived of medals."
Despite his comments, the Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban. Previously, the report of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) referred to the discovery of evidence of Russian State sponsorship of the use of stimulants, which was implemented in November 2015.
"I think today's response was very frank, very frank, and I think I'm telling the press.
"The entire Council and the UNTAC are pleased ... the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has gone through a very intense period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can re-enter the competition ... "
He says he's also "joyed" that Russia has accepted the criteria for re-entry.
"I think it's a very constructive day, and I think we've made some progress, but the U.N. Congress supports the Panel's recommendations, and this is not the time to restore Russia's candidacy."
"We need to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
Our guiding principle has been the desire to separate innocent athletes from the contaminated system, "He adds.
Nineteen Russian athletes meet the strict standards of the Federation and will participate as neutrals in the World Fields Championships held in London on Friday.
The head of the IPPF Task Force, Vern Anderson, said on Monday that Russia had not yet met a number of criteria for resuming the competition.
After his speech in London to the International Council of Federations, he told reporters that drug testing was still inadequate and banned coaches were still teaching.

The People's Dollar's Central Price is down by 66 points.
Macroeconomics 208-01-18 09:50
On January 18th, the RMB paid $6.4401 against the United States dollar, and the previous day ' s midpoint depreciated by 66 basis points, putting an end to the previous five consecutive increases.
The overnight market, the dollar warms, the dollar index gets out of the V-word form, at 07:30 Beijing time, 90.89000.
The Federal Reserve published a book on the economy, showing that almost all 12 Federal Reserve regions reported moderate to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018 and remained optimistic about the outlook for the year.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate in the United States remained at 4.1 per cent in December, the lowest since 2000, and business is expected to raise wages in the coming months.
Federal Reserve officials are generally of the view that tax reform is a factor in support of this modestly strong economic outlook, and the Federal Reserve forecast an economic growth rate of 2.5 per cent in 2018, with an interest increase of three times.
Marketers have pointed out that, in recent times, the ECB’s monetary policy has tightened expectations of an increase in the euro’s exchange rate, the United States dollar index has fallen continuously, and the renminbi’s exchange rate against the United States dollar has risen rapidly accordingly, although it is unlikely that the ECB will quickly adjust its policy stance, that short-term fluctuations in the foreign exchange market will eventually return to its fundamentals, and that the continued smooth running of the renminbi’s exchange rate is a general event.
It is worth noting that, as the market is expected to stabilize the renminbi, the attractiveness of the renminbi assets to investors abroad is becoming increasingly evident.
The Chinese People ' s Bank authorized the China Foreign Exchange Exchange Exchange Centre to announce that on 18 January 2018, the median exchange rate for the currency exchange market between banks would be as follows: US$ 1 against the renminbi 6.4401; US$ 1 against the renminbi 7.8482; US$ 100 against the renminbi 5.7854; HK$ 1 against the renminbi 0.82399; US$ 1 against the renminbi 89017; US$ 1 against the renminbi 5.1302; US$ 1 against the renminbi 4.6779 against the renminbi; US$ 1 against the renminbi 4.8546 against the renminbi; US$ 1 against the renminbi 6.66731; US$ 1 against the renminbi 5.1747 against the renminbi; US$ 1 against the renminbi 0.61399 against the renminbi; US$ 1 against the renminbi 88332; US$ 1 against the renminbi against the renminbi 8.9128; US$ 1 against the US$ 165.95 against the renminbi; US$ 1 against the renminbi 1 against the renminbi 1 against the US$ 0.57030; US$ 1 against the US$ 0.901; SEK 1 against the US$ 1; SEK 0.901; SEK 1 against the US$ 1; KK 1 against the SEK 1; SEK 1 against the US$ 1; and SEK 1 over the FK 1;
Today, 10 March, at 7.50 a.m., a chemical plant exploded in the new township of Henan Province and the scene rose in the dark.
The news reporter from the New Towns and County Commission's Advocacy Department learned that the explosion had injured one person.
A video released by local netizens showed that the explosion was in smoke and was accompanied by a sound.
According to some online friends, this morning, the explosion occurred at a chemical plant in Xiaotao, Niang commune, Henan Province.
The news reporter from the New Kyoto newspaper learned that the manufacturing plant is Henan Province ' s New Town Six Industries Ltd.
According to public sources, the above-mentioned enterprises were established in February 2002 to cover the manufacture of chemical products.
In response, this afternoon, the Department of Communication of the NRC stated that the explosion had taken place at 7.50 a.m. and that the fire was now effectively controlled and that one person had suffered minor injuries.

4 telecommunications fraud syndicates have been transnationalized by the Hubei police and more than 500 cases in 31 provinces and counties amounting to more than $70 million
This newspaper reporter Choi Changchun's law and order daily reporter learned today from the Ministry of Public Security that the case of fraud in the transnational telecommunications network, which was solved by the police in Hubei Xiaoyang, under the command of the Ministry of Public Security and in cooperation with the Malaysian Police, is a more representative case of fraud in the telecommunications network in Taiwan.
What is the impact of football financial rules on Neymar's transition to Paris?
The rules designed to prevent unrestricted spending by European luxury football clubs will not prevent Nemar from moving from the Barcelona Club in Spain to the St. Germain Football Club in Paris (PSG) in France at record prices.
The consequence is that the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has further downgraded the St. Germain Football Club in Paris.
The "Financial Fair Competition Rules" (FFP) launched by the Federation of European Unions in 2011 means that the Paris Club of St. Germain Football must finally prove that the Némar transfer will be funded without causing substantial losses.
The Barcelona Club has paid €222 million ($262 million) simply to cover the cost of the Brazilian player's release, and Nell's salary will be as high as tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Nemal's transfer to France.
Considering that the team is funded by the rich Qatari ruling family, the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris can, of course, sign Nell in cash and include him in the team of other stars.
Clubs can spend a lot of money to buy players, but they have to use their legitimate sources of income to make up for the money they spend and to balance their gains and losses in football-related operations.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules were conceived by Michel Platini after he was elected president of the Federation in 2007.
According to the former French player, if banks or owners withdraw their support funds, they are deceiving and putting the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the rule's focus shifted from the club's debt to the club's loss monitoring.
This change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich when he acquired the Chelsea Club in 2003, namely, to buy a club with potential and then spend a lot of money to improve the team and build a global brand, is now in a more demanding position.
During the three-year "rule" assessment period up to 2018, the club could lose 30 million euros.
Aleksander Ceferin, a successor to the Federation, is still committed to stopping excessive spending, despite Abu being devalued by the current president in 2015.
Of course, the rule is still in effect, and we're sure to strengthen the future.
Although the St. Germain Football Club in Paris will pay a lump sum of the Nemal terms of purchase, it may also allocate the amount for accounting purposes within the duration of the contract.
Nemar has signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer of contributions may be shown in the annual account for the next five years at a cost of Euro44.4 million.
The first wave of the "rules" sanctions imposed in 2014 brought the strongest sanctions to the Paris Club of St. Germain Football and the Manchester City Club under Abu Dhabi.
The St. Germain Football Club in Paris was fined Euro60 million (US$82 million at the exchange rate at the time), which was reduced to Euro20 million, and demanded that the team be reduced to 21 instead of 25 regular players in the 2014-15 season championships.
The Federación is looking at clubs that try to increase income by linking them to the owners of the clubs and to deceive financial regulators.
Although Qatari companies can sponsor the St. Germain Football Club in Paris, if the amount of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market price, the Union will not consider it a legitimate income.
This is what happened in 2014, when the Federation decided that the amount of money that the Qatar Tourist Board sponsored in the Paris Club of St. Germain had been exaggerated.
It was reported that a portion of Nemal's income at the St. Germain Football Club in Paris might come from payments made by the Qatar World Cup Organizing Committee in 2022.
However, both the St. Germain Football Club in Paris and the Organizing Committee denied that Nemal would be an ambassador to the World Cup, and that such an initiative would be easy for the EFTA regulatory bodies.
The recent sanctions imposed on the St. Germain Football Club in Paris mean that the Federation will be more vigilant about any attempt to circumvent the rules.
According to sources, on Thursday, the Federation did not have a pre-discussion with the Paris football club in St. Germain about the transfer of Nemal.
The above-mentioned individuals contacted the Associated Press in an anonymous capacity only because they were not authorized to discuss the situation of the St. Germain Football Club in Paris.
According to the last published accounts, the operating income of the St. Germain Football Club in Paris in 2015-16 was Euro542.4 billion, making more than Euro10 million.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not been disclosed.
The football club in St. Germain, Paris, anticipates that Nell's union will bring the gospel of sponsorship, franchising and the sale of jerseys.
The club is expected to grow by at least 30% after the signing of the Namar.
Obviously, seeing one of the most famous players leave, the Spanish Union is outraged by the attempt to block this move by Nemar and claims that the Paris Club of St. Germain football violated the "rules".
"This is a clear example of a "financial stimulant", as President Javier Tebás told the Spanish newspaper AS, that the club and the country are the same," meaning Qatar, which has the ultimate ownership of the St. Germain Football Club in Paris.
Arsene Wenger, coach of the Assenal team (all of whom are American sports tycoons), has reservations about the attitude of the state-funded club and the Western League.
"This is the consequence of ownership, which has completely changed the entire ecology of 15 years of football in the past " , Wenger said on Thursday.
"When the state owns the club, everything happens.
This will make it very difficult to comply with the "rules" because there are many different ways or interests for a country to require a big player to represent a country. "
Robid, the smart interactive robot developer, got a new investment.
In recent years, start-ups in the field of artificial intelligence have continued to be emboldened by capital.
Artificial intelligence Rakid has recently completed a new round of financing, led by Le Mansi, Swiss credit, CDIB (an investment agency under the auspices of Taiwan's China Development Finance Holding Corporation), old shareholders like IDG Capital, etc.
It has been reported that the size of the current round of financing is approximately $100 million, and that for the first time Switzerland and CDIB have been involved in domestic financing transactions in the area of artificial intelligence.

The premiere of the 3D home-painted film "Tofu" 25 in Wuhan, "Tofu" director, "Tofu" director, "Tofu" animation director with wisdom, film choreographer, Emmy winner Tom Disher, shared the story of film creation on the scene.
"Tofu" is based on the story of Liu An, Handai Huanan Wang of China's traditional culture, and is born out of the classic book "Lou An is making tofu, made out of error", which tells us that the master "Tofu" is made of a bean who is fascinated by an adult, overcomes the difficulties and insists on the dream of the Quixin. This novel is deeply rooted in the Animation Film and the local culture of the North of the Lake.

He said that the story of "Tofu" occurred in the context of the West Han Vu Emperor, King Liu An Jindang, the owner of the film "Tofu" was an unexpectedly adult-shaped bean in Liu An Jindan.
In addition to the Wudang Mountains, which are the source of the Taoist culture, Hubei has a deep roots in the ancient traditional instrument of Chinese writing.

The Old Infective Power Market -- "Halla Summer Camp" and "Intelligent Twins."
This story is recapitulated in memory of actors in the 80s of the wind and the 1990s of the era of garbage (before and after David Wayne and Michael Schwart made a sketch "The Nation" for MTV); it is also a memory of old times and 2001; before that, many stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Luther, had yet to emerge.
As a cultural art, it's a mimic and a reflection of our permanent memory in the Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time is running out.
The first day of the camp echoed strongly, but not just because of its ridiculous humor.
The double use of the core laugh in the play -- middle-aged actors playing kids at the age of trouble -- makes it impossible to go back to the past and become a funny part of it.
Ten years later, adults actually play adult roles, and their emotions are not too deep-rooted and their imitations are more widespread, including improvising creations of the 90s tracking films, such as "the hand that drives the cradle."
At some point, a character got stuck in an apple notebook, some straight skates and "Some other things from 1991".

There's another treacherous conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Seward), instigated by George H. W. Bush (Michael Ian Black, impressed).
As always, the best part of this series is interventions.
It's particularly interesting to see Mr. Luthor, who was always young, showing off Matt Dillon's soul patch in the film "Single Aristocrats," and Andy from the former "Student Giants" now feels like a giant.
This is a time of random madness, which could give impetus to the film, like the "Seven Years of Life" series, until it comes to what I thought was logical: "Halla Camp: Twenty Years Later," the final scene of which was a premiere of the movie "Halla Camp".

This comedy, written by Brian Gatwood and Alexandro Tanaka, was pushed onto the television screen by director Reese Thomas: it's a comedy by brother-in-law, set up in Romania in the '80s to tell the story of two Bucharest officials fighting for truth, atheism and Marx Leninianism.
The main players - the hard-core Grigor and the idealist Essef - were played by young Florin Pirszi and Cornelius Ulrich, respectively, and their conversations were spelled in English by Chanin Tatum (also the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levite.

But Detective Two males are so dedicated to creating a brazen and genuine comedy -- a killer with a Reagan mask in it -- and it usually plays that part.
The six episode shows a slight drag and the comedy effect is not released fast enough or frequently.
Detective Two-Mothers is a much stricter editor, showing better sarcasm when Gregor and Essef visit the United States Embassy repeatedly, because there are always fat boys in the lobby of the embassy who swallow a bunch of burgers.

In recent interviews, journalists have learned that in the north-east, there has been a general decline and even a loss in the benefits of such industries as iron and steel, orbital traffic, ships, mechanical manufacturing, etc.
Some experts were of the view that, under the current circumstances, the new round of industrial revival in the north-east was not only related to the recovery of the national economy, but would also have an impact on the long-term development of our manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, and that there was an urgent need to restructure the transformation.
The general decline in business performance in the traditional industries, which suffer from a sharp decline or even losses in the manufacturing of raw materials industries and heavy machinery and equipment, is the primary manifestation of industry in the middle and north-east of the downturn in the current round.
In the past, in the downside of the economy, mainly at the lower end, primary products were heavily hit, but this economic volatility affected both the high end of the traditional Northeast industry and the lower end of the industry.
The Saddler Group (Webbo) began with the restructuring of products in previous years, focusing on the development of high-end panels such as container boards, steel tracks, boatboards and civil household panels, but this year there has been a significant decrease in sales of these varieties, particularly the 50 per cent drop in sales of board over the same period last year.
Haw Kyung-soon, Head of the Metallurgical Department of Liaoning Province, explained that metallurgy was the third pillar of Liaoning ' s industry, with 60 million tons of steel capacity per year ranked third in the country.
In January-May this year, Liaoning Province produced 2,154 million tons of crude steel, and national policies encouraged better production and distribution of the products needed for well-established local government projects, and the sharper decline in market competition was another characteristic of the Northeast manufacturing industry.

The Japanese Olympic Committee recently stated that the Japanese delegation had 30 gold medals in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games and had advanced to the top three of the gold medals.
Last October, the Chairman of the Japanese Olympic Committee's sports committee, Tae-su Yama, said that the total number of gold medals expected from the Japanese gym at the Tokyo Olympics was 2.5 times that of the Rio Games.
At the 2016 Rio Olympics, the Japanese delegation was ranked sixth in 12 gold medals.

10 February News: The journalist learned yesterday from the Changzhou City Committee of Agriculture that this year, building on the successful creation of a national forest city in 2016, the Changzhou City will further implement the National Forest City Building Master Plan (2014-2025) in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, consolidating the achievements of national forest cities, building green harmony and high-quality forest cities for all.
The Bank of England will maintain a 0.25% interest rate.
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain unchanged, and earlier weak economic growth and relaxed inflation have dashed upward hopes.
The Bank of England warns that growth will continue to be "weak" because it controls interest rates while strengthening household incomes.
The Bank ' s monetary policy committee (MPC) policymakers have decided to maintain a 0.25 per cent interest rate by a 6-2 vote, while a few members this month have called for higher interest rates, even if weak economic growth has weakened the upward boost.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reduced growth projections to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018, respectively, and issued a warning that household income contraction would continue, while inflation would skyrocket to nearly 3 per cent in the fall.
However, it suggests that interest rates will need to be raised in the coming years to contain the inflation associated with Europe, while borrowing costs may need to be increased even further than expected in the financial markets.
A year ago, a large-scale economic promotion policy was implemented, and members voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce the suspension of the regular financing scheme to provide the banks with low-cost funds starting next February, although the Bank claims that under the plan, the Bank will now need an additional £15 billion over £115 billion.
In the minutes of interest rate decision-making meetings, the Bank of England stated: "In the core projections of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) has remained weak in the near future, as real household income contraction will continue to suppress consumption."
With respect to interest rates, the Bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for "a certain monetary policy tightening" to suppress inflation, and for a greater degree than market expectations.
The market is now expected to grow for the first time in the third quarter of next year, and for the second time in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any upturn would be "slow" and "restricted".
The Bank's growth projections for this year and next year show a downward trend, compared to the projections for May of 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The bank maintains projections of 1.8 per cent growth in 2018.
The pound's going down against the dollar, and the euro follows.
The exchange rate of the pound against the United States dollar fell by 0.5 per cent to 1.31, and by 0.4 per cent to the euro to 1.11.
Before the decision to stay unchanged appeared, the rising expectations had been dashed by recent unoptimistic growth data.In the second quarter, GDP had risen to 0.3 per cent, compared to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
It says the growth in the third quarter is likely to remain at 0.3 per cent, although it will increase slightly by the end of the year.
Ordinary households are hit by inflation surges and wage increases are negligible, and the recent inflation report by the Bank of England does not give them any good news because it claims that austerity will get worse before it gets better.
And it says that monetary policy "can't prevent" the impact on income over the next few years, but wages are expected to recover on a massive scale at the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, owing to the depreciation of the pound sterling and the significant growth in demand for British commodities, the economy will be stimulated to offset some of the effects of low consumption.
One year before that decision, the alarming European Union referendum had caused the pound to fall sharply, and interest rates had fallen to 0.25 per cent in August.
The Bank of England estimates that it may take four years to fully influence prices and the British economy.
Until the Bank publishes its latest decision on interest rates, the call for interest rate increases is overwhelming, as inflation exacerbates already stressful ordinary households, while three policymakers call for interest rates to be raised to 0.5% in July.
Last month inflation fell from 2.9 per cent in June to 2.6 per cent, although the Bank of England said it was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
It's called the last line of the weak pound against its 2% target.
The director of the Coreco Mortgage Brokers, Andrew Montereyk, said: "In view of the recent fall in interest rates, the mortgage market once again seems to be becoming more competitive, because lenders are strongly calling for more business and look forward to a positive end for this year.
For those who may be nearing the end of their existing transactions, such a market would seem particularly beneficial, as re-collateralization (many are free of charge and interest rates are low) is becoming more popular.
The China Seismic Network officially determined that on 13 November, at 1902 hours, there was an earthquake of 8.0 degrees in New Zealand (42.53 degrees south and 173.05 degrees east) with a depth of 10 kilometres and a strong feeling in the capital, Wellington.
The UK National Health Service (NHS) has a very controversial HIV drug that turns on the green light.
After the High Court's decision on NHS's drug financing, patients will be able to receive "transformational" HIV preventive treatment from September.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis, a pre-sexual drug, had been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk populations by about 86%. Health services will now provide the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year preliminary experiment.
It agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal had upheld the High Court ruling last year. The ruling stated that, although NHS claimed that local authorities should fund the drug, NHS was entitled to pay for PEP.
The announcement made on Thursday was called "a major new intervention" by Simon Stevens, Chief Executive Officer of the UK NHS, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as "a critical moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first registered sexual health clinics in October, followed by full implementation in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylactic (PrEP) is a pre-sexually administered HIV drug that reduces the risk of HIV infection.
Tests show that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking PEP before sex means there's enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
This drug can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include homosexuals, bisexuals, transgender persons and positive HIV carriers who have not successfully received treatment.
The clinic will determine whether eligible participants, including men, women, intersex persons and persons whose sexual partner HIV infection status is unknown are receiving antiretroviral treatment.
Persons who reside and register as general practitioners in England can also enrol in their local sexual health clinic.
The plan will cost £10 million and the NHS England branch has signed a contract to purchase these drugs this week after international competitive procurement.
The experiment aims to assess the full potential of PEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is located, absorbed and implemented on the basis of large samples.
Mr. Stevens said, "This major new intervention should complement and reinforce HIV prevention with a broad and increasingly successful response.
This is another milestone in 30 years of action worth making progress in addressing the major health challenges of humanity ... "
The Chief Executive Officer of the United Kingdom AIDS Trust, Deborah King, said, "This is a critical moment in the fight against AIDS.
If it does target populations in need and at risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis offer the possibility of a change in the UK ' s AIDS epidemic.
Starting in September, the HIV-at-risk population will be able to obtain, through the NHS-funded experiment in England, a new, licensed tool that is truly self-executing and that does not require consultation with sexual partners, which will improve the lives of so many people.
We're in favour of this announcement. "
"The top priority now is to ensure that the test is spread rapidly throughout the country and that none of the people infected with HIV is left behind."
Now that we've bought PEP experimental drugs, we're ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of HIV. "
The shadow Minister of Public Health, Sharon Hodgeson, claimed: "After months of delay and government delays, the start of PrEP's initial test was popular and should have come earlier.
Evidence shows how this drug can bring about change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and combating the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This experiment will give us a better understanding of the advantages of PEP.
It is now very important that this experiment be launched as soon as possible throughout the country in order to protect people exposed to HIV and to help us to put an end even further to the spread of HIV in society ... "

High-quality life: using the attic and crafted design to make the small apartment of the Countess Palace a spacious home
Joanne Ray, once a banker, was very keen on renovating her house, and in 2014 she moved from her big house on Knights Bridge to a small apartment in the Earle Palace.
This apartment is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace -- Joanne didn't pack her bags and sell it -- which is a strong proof of the new design.
"Before then, I lived with my ex-boyfriend in a bigger house on Knightsbridge," Joanne said.
"I was looking for the right house to offer.
I saw this apartment at the Earle's, and it's tall.
I'd like to make an offer on the same day. "
This 1,000 square feet apartment has now been completely overhauled since the first look at the house.
This apartment was originally a complex single room -- it needed to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom -- and Joanne wanted to increase the storage space and the attic to make full use of the full ceiling height.
"I want high ceilings, big windows, plenty of light.
That's what I'm asking, "She said.
To that end, she hired Elvan Azadi from the Duck&Shed Building and Design Studio (in Notting Hill) to use this 12.5-foot-high ceiling to build a family, not only a development project, but also a place where Joanne lives.
The height of the ceiling is not enough to add two spaces up and down, so the building challenge is to create an attic high enough to stand up.
Ervan has to think creatively to solve this problem.
"The steel structure is quite complex," he explains.
"We must arrange space for it to be displayed up and down, without the need for shrugs.
It's not just as simple as building a simple platform, but starting up the steel to keep it at the right level to function ... " .
Through this arrangement, Elvan was able to get two rooms in the space -- a lot of fun elements to add.
The penthouse uses the Retrouvius brand of copper windows to overlooking the attractive areas of life.
Gold furniture with mirrors, small silver furniture, and serge mouille lighted the whole style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
Put a mirror on both ends of the hallway and make it look longer.
In the kitchen, it's like a window to another room with a mirror in it.
At the bottom of the gate, the little grids with mirrors provide room for Joanne to store dishes and glassware.
The beautiful living room has an interesting sense of space to put the kitchen away when it's not used.
Collapse kitchens aren't fresh.
But the unique thing about this folding kitchen is a garage lift door.
"There's some engineering knowledge here. "Ellfan explains the steel reinforced perimeter of the MDF door.
"This is a balance principle, so when you push the door, it's easy to slide."
Joanne got an extra 16 square metres, an extra bedroom and an improved layout due to the clever use of space and storage.
"In the end, you sell the size of the house -- or your property is valued on the basis of the size of the house," Ellfan said.
"In essence, the real estate agent walks into the room and calculates it according to the size of the floor."
They'll try to increase the land space while using high-quality materials, thus creating a sense of luxury in the space.
Elvan says, "The material is your own choice, and it helps to create emotional bonds in the home."
"You won't love the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they don't hold your heart. "
It turns out, with good design and additional space, standard apartments can shake you up.
In fact, you might have chosen to live in the same way as Joanne.

Two brothers in the 500-million-dollar Real Estate War.
Forty years after his Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers worth more than $500 million, one of Victoria's largest real estate empires fought for war.
The former director and developer of Carlton's football club Colin De Lutis lives in a mansion in the Tulkara district, and the three doors are at the distance of his brother Paul, who sued him in the Supreme Court about the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the two brothers have had an intense debate about the division of assets in the Supreme Court.
Both brothers and their mothers owned 38 real estates worth more than $500 million, which the family had accumulated since it bought Smith Street in Colinwood in 1973.
There, the family founded the Westco Jeans company and gradually expanded it to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, it sold it for $85 million.
At present, the De Lutis estate portfolio consists of city buildings, the Brunswick and Solento development projects, the Golden Coast and the Hills Apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with his late father, Colin, who was called by his brother Paul as the "principal protagonist and dominant figure" of the De Lutis family, owned about two thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounted for about one third.
According to the documents submitted to the Tribunal, the converted value of Colin's property was $316 million, while Paul's property was $176 million.
Paul came to believe that the division between real estate and cash was the crux of the bargain.
" The property division proposal put forward by Colin left him what I thought was the best property " , he wrote in a first court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the Supreme Court held its first hearing.
Now, the two brothers are fighting for control of the existing business, and Paul says Colin kicked him out.
Colin denied it and accused Paul of failing to manage certain properties.
In Colin's early affidavit, he expressed a desire to settle the dispute.
"My Italian tradition determines the family as the most important option. My Italian origin determines the family as the most important " , he wrote.
The cost of the case has been rising, and hundreds of pages of affidavits, e-mails, and company reports submitted by Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, top law firm, QC, and senior lawyers engaged by both parties.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants, and they started running a public restaurant and a deli shop in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brenrick in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy Colin Wood's property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin said, "I was in high school when he started Westco," and Paul was very young. "
Anna de Lutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to be able to hand over their property to their son in peace.
"Luigui used to say to me that he never wanted his brothers to end up in court " , she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, were no longer members of De Lutis Group, and Colin said that Mark had paid him $10 million when he left the company and $26 million to Luke.
Paul said that Luke and Mark were both "unsatisfied with the division of their property."
According to the biography published in 2015 by television star Eddie McGuire, Colin has been keeping a low profile even though he was a board member of the former AFL Club.
The Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
But only Colin replied by text. He said, "I really can't say much because the case has been brought to court."
" My brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family business to court, which is very, very sad " , he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to meet his brother ' s demands.
He said, "Our father doesn't want to see Paul and I end up in a dispute like this," and added, "He still has hope for a settlement."
Friday, the hope seems to be dashed.
"Our problems will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

Trump's new Chief of Staff planned to limit the President's media time.
Others tried, but they all failed.
John F. Kelly might really be able to do it.
If that's true, then he's the first.
According to US political news website Politico, the new White House Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including media reports, in order to ensure greater stability for the big boss.
The following is a quote from journalist Josh Darcy:
"When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, came to a meeting with senior officials on the first day of his work, he pointed out that he was addressing one of the main issues of President Trump's admission to the White House: bad information in the hands of the President."
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the President to make better decisions, and that it would therefore need to be done in his hands, whether in writing or in the form of a briefing.
Kelly's diagnosis seems to be the same, but others tried to tame Trump's media time, but eventually they all failed.
President Trump's TV addiction has long been -- now in the White House, his TV habits are still growing.
In February, former campaign consultant Sam Naberg told Politico: "If candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, it would be helpful for him to know that he has received positive coverage through credible channels.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote, "In the light of the experience of six former campaign officials, the habit of controlling Trump's tweets is to ensure that media messages received by him always contain some kind of praise."
It's totally fine.
But Trump's Twitter habits used to be "controlled" are ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don't know — that Trump's Twitter would have been even more angry if it hadn't been for their intervention.
We may never know the Twitters that Trump didn't send.
If his staff were able to save him from the fire, their efforts would be worth it if only a few times.
But no one can keep Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House of competing groups, people promote their world view by transmitting information to Trump that may be reliable or unreliable.
Politico -- all about this story -- reported in May on advisers' preferences for strategically providing suspicious information to the president.
This is an example described by journalist Shane Goodmancher:
"The current and former Trump officials claim that Trump's reaction to negative news clips, such as volcanic eruptions, especially those with destructive information leaks, would be crazy to find out where it came from.
At the end of February, the President received a malicious copy of an article on the web-incitement Charles C. Johnson website, GotNews.com, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff, Katie Walsh, of "the source of the massive leak of information" at the White House, as Trump did at that time.
Even if Johnson had been permanently banned by Twitter for harassment, no concrete evidence had been provided, and he had exploded a lot of false accusations, which he later publicly denied.
Trump read the article and started asking officials about Walsh ... "
Goodmancher also said that the then chief of staff, Reins Pribas and White House secretary Robert Potter, had tried to create a system to manage and record the documents received by Trump."
What happened?
Kelly's going to do the same thing in three months.
Maybe he can prove himself to be a more efficient administrator than Pribas, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump whose assistant still competes with each other for influence.
These constant influences will make Kelly's mission even more difficult.
Traveling town: how the wind gets drunk.
[Summary] Zhejiang town's potential has been gradually awakened.
Now, these towns are important destinations for tourists to watch Zaizen water, to read Zhesan culture, and to feel the pain of Zhejiang, and they will also provide an important boost to my efforts to create the most beautiful tourist destination in China.
It's better than that.
"The social scenes go up with the moon and the sausage smells like the wind.
"Stamping the town of Anchanggu, where traditional crafts such as machining, bamboo-making, iron-trapped, shoes-picking flowers and cotton-wiping techniques are widely visible, displaying the intangible cultural heritage of the town of Anchanggu. Tourists are intoxicated to observe and experience the ethos of Xu Xu and to appreciate the atmosphere of historical culture and culture.
According to the information received, more than 65,000 visitors to Anchanggu town during the three-day holiday this year.
In Zhejiang, a unique town, like the town of Anchanggu, is a chess piece: the Xiaobang of Jia Jinxi Tong, with the warmth of the river of Gangnam; Dewar of Quezhou, with the white wall of Quixiang City, with the end of a thousand years; fishermen of the town of Ishigang in Taizhou, with the painting of traditional and modern-day fisher life; these towns are the Qijiang tourmen's "bonds" and the eight tourists' "hearts love" .
In recent years, the potential of Zhejiang town has been gradually awakened as our provincial tour progresses.
In 2016, the Office of the Provincial Government officially released "The Implementation of the Creation of Tourism Township in Zhejiang Province" which proposes to receive and designate, for about five years, about 100 popular towns throughout the province, with a fine ecological environment and a tourist-like provincial tourism style.
Now, these towns are important destinations for tourists to watch Zaizen water, to read Zhesan culture, and to feel the pain of Zhejiang, and they will also provide an important boost to my efforts to create the most beautiful tourist destination in China.
The head of the Department of Tourism explained that, in the midst of the emergence of a tourist town, we now place greater emphasis on the development of a personalized tourism industry in towns and cities across the province, with new tourism projects and industry offering a rich experience for tourists and winning good slogans.
Focus on promotion
Recently, under the auspices of Zhejiang Province Tourist Board, Zhejiang Daily News Corporation, the Zhejiang News Company, which is hosting the All Media Center for Tourism, shares a collection and poems of Zhejiang? The Town of Zhejiang Tourist Town Festival closing season in Zhejiang Province.
"The fair town has the beauty of art and the temperature of life.
The town's style is raw juice, original smell, native land, pure ecology.
"Teacher of the Film Animation and Art Department of the Chinese Academy of Fine Arts, director of the first-line video advertising in China, Xie Hanfung, and Professor Xu Xiao Xuan, Dean of the School of Arts and Communication of the Chinese University of Metrology, told cross-border stories about small towns like "The Small Village Renovation" in camera.
There are many tourist towns in Zhejiang with deep cultural resources, and a new town from the city of Nanjing in Huzhou was created to read about the country.
The town of Jiangnan has been loved by painters since ancient times, and now the town of Nanjinggu is working in depth with such art schools as the Chinese American Academy.
Tourism-friendly small towns must have a cultural element, a tourist element, a service element and an environmental element.
In this context, tourism services and environments are also important elements.
Rainy days with a timely umbrella will also give tourists a better experience of the town.
In this age of sharing, the hottest shared umbrellas of the All Media Center for Tourism of Zhe newspaper have been designed to promote the idea of sharing? Green, to raise the awareness and public interest of tourists and residents of small towns to share a wonderful tourist environment.
It's one of the bright spots of the "Possic Zhejiang? There's a lot of love in this town" season.
Looking forward to it.
To date, Zhejiang Province has published a list of the first 21 provincial tourist towns created and 115 provincial tourist towns fostered.
As a priority area for development during the "13th Five" period of rural tourism, the town will eventually be built into a tourist attraction area of 3A and above, becoming a new model of diversity of tourism products, high tourism efficiency, and industrial convergence win-win.
The main thing about the attraction of a tourist town is the taste of its original juice.
The beauty of a tourist town stems not only from the blighting of small bridges, but also from a long-standing cultural tradition; the revival of the countryside stems from cultural self-confidence.
Throughout the world, the Dutch town of Lisser, the Austrian town of Halstadt, the French town of pumpkins, with tulips, salt and pumpkins as their core attractions, attracts a large number of tourists from all over the world every year, enabling tourism to boost the small town ' s economy.
For wind towns, the focus on "showing the mark, keep the town alive" has given the town a distinct personality and soul, more so as to provide cultural immersion, to carry local art, and to highlight the culture of the countryside.
Traveling in a small town, bound by culture and rural sorrow, with a human and landscape as a vehicle, connecting tourists across the world, allowing traditional culture and culture to be shared, innovative.
In essence, a tourist town is a complex and open tourist attraction, and more importantly, a shared living space between local residents and visitors and even Travellers.
As the main battleground for future tourism growth, tourist towns may not only change the ecological landscape of villages, the way economic and social development takes place, the direction of industrial factor flows, but also bridge the urban-rural infrastructure divide and awaken the important forces of rural culture recovery.
In the tide of the country's accelerated revival, Zhejiang tourist town will be a richer story.
Data show that 70 per cent of China ' s travel needs are concentrated within three kilometres, so that the entire short-distance market is bound to share a bicycle sooner or later.
"Japan Finance News" reports that inflationary pressures will increase as a result of the fiscal expansion policies of the next Trump regime and that the rate of interest growth will accelerate in 2017.

The tenant negotiates the ditch and returns to Richter Street.
Some of the richest owners of the West Midrands have once again been in dispute with determined tenants who have negotiated a government-excavated ditch for the return of land other than the mansion.
The tenants parked 20 of their trailers in an open area outside of Soliher Street, which was crowned Rich.
The tenants, holding the horses, carrying the baby and leading the RV convoy, returned in May and the mound of the city didn't stop them from entering.
This lean and sophisticated team found a gap in this line of defense, and although there was no roadblock for passage, their vehicles were squeezed through that gap.
The angry population criticized the Solihull Council strongly and called it "defeated in dealing with the problem".
One unnamed resident said, "They were there on Monday night, before they came to Benliches Street, throwing stones at passers-by.
The Commission should be ashamed of what they did, because they were doing nothing.
The tenants came here in May and then they got kicked out, and now they're back.
There's been a lot last night. There's probably more today."
She added: "The Birmingham City Council knows how to handle it by enforcing a long-term ban to protect its park.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I'm not willing to continue paying municipal taxes if the council can't stop it.
A local resident who didn't want to give his name said, "This is ridiculous. We just saw the last group of tenants leave, just for another group to destroy.
This time the number has increased, and some even saw horses eating grass on the park lawn. "
A woman spokesperson for the Soliher Commission said, "We know that unauthorized camping is taking place in an open area of Schultzbrook Road, and now we work with the Solihr police and take the necessary legal action to get them out of here as soon as possible.
In order to support us in collecting evidence, it is important that as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal acts to the police by calling 101.
This will help us outline the situation when we refer the case to the Court for the Court ' s review ... "

Italy ' s strong attitude towards non-governmental organization migrant rescue boats
Italy warned non-governmental organizations operating migration rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue carrying out rescue operations unless new operational regulations were signed.
In an interview with the Daily newspaper Turin, the Minister of the Interior, Marco Minnitti, stated: "If NGOs do not sign new codes of conduct, it is hard to see how they will go after them."
The day before Minnity's warning, Italian officials detained a German aid organization, the crew of a ship, suspected of actually collaborating with traffickers to assist illegal immigrants.
The aid organization only operated for one year and refused to comment on the specific subject of the charges against Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartocio.
In a social media statement, the organization said, "For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing, so we regret not being able to operate in search and rescue zones at this time."
" After collecting all the information, we can only assess all the allegations and situations... "
The Italian government has been watching the Youth Rescue ship since October.
Its crew is suspected of carrying migrants who are being transported directly from small boats by traffickers and allowing smugglers to flee in haste and re-use ships.
According to the prosecutor's documents, at least one such meeting was allegedly held at sea 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast. The document was published by the Italian media.
Its crew is suspected of blatant disregard for the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which supervises rescue operations in the area out of humanitarian enthusiasm and not for any other motive.
According to the code of conduct, ships like Iuventa clearly require an Italian officer to supervise their activities on board.
At present, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code of conduct: Save the Children, with headquarters in Malta, and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new provisions to be unnecessary but acceptable, as they did not bring any "significant changes and obstacles" to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign were the Nobel Prize-winning MSF.
At the same time, Minniti claims that the sharp drop in the number of immigrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks indicates that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guards and to unite local mayors have begun to bear fruit.
The minister said, "In recent days, we've begun to see the dawn at the end of the tunnel."
He announced plans for in-depth talks this month: discussions with Libyan mayors on economic development activities and with Chad, Niger and Mali on how to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries for Europe.

A new initiative in Beijing to "reconciliate" schools: thousands of teachers and students from the Northern Chemical Industry will be admitted to the new campus in Changping
The inauguration of the new campus of the Beijing Chemical University was held in Changping District, Beijing, where 1,800 acres of green campuses are officially operational.
Journalists learned from the ceremony that, in order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and to combat the disease of the Great City, in recent years, in the context of the concerted development and defusion of non-Capital functions in Kyoto, Beijing has accelerated the dissipation of central city high schools to suburban areas, and some students and teachers of high schools are moving to new suburban campuses such as Héngang, Hoyama and others.
The new school district of the North Chemical Industry, located in the town of Changping south, occupied 1,800 acres of land, 40 kilometres from the city, and was one of the priority projects of the city of Beijing to dissipate non-capital functions.
The new school is divided into three phases, the current one is fully completed, the second phase is expected to be fully launched by the end of the year, and when fully completed, the plan will meet the needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduate students, graduate students and teaching staff for study and life.
When we look back at this year's film market, we find that the original text of the film and the two crowds of stars are an important part of the audience that the film expects.
Today, at 1710 hours, the 119th Command Center of the city of Shunyang was called to fire fire on the storage of tetrahydrofurans at the Hoon Zhichang plant in the city ' s two-cooked district.
Suyang City Fire Squad immediately dispatched 20 fire trucks with heavy chemical suits and equipment such as limousine cleaners to the scene.
After preliminary detection, the fires were carried out in small storage tanks for chemical substances such as tetrahydrofurans, which produced larger smoke at the site.
At the time of the press release, the firefighters were in intensive rescue, city health, security, environmental protection, security, traffic and so on, and no casualties were reported.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to death for texting to encourage Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide via text messages and telephone calls.
In the current year, 20-year-old Michelle Carter will be serving a 15-month sentence, which may be converted to probation.
Carter was convicted in June of unintentional unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is devastated.
My son is my best friend. "
While awaiting appeal, Carter was granted liberty of person.
She faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, but her lawyers think she and Mr. Roy are both mentally ill.
At the time of sentencing, Carter stood up, wearing red pants and rice coats, holding his hands tight, with tears on his eyes and looking down.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life for better.
She's not responsible " , the prosecutor says.
"She didn't have any remorse."
But Carter's lawyer says it's a terrible consequence, and she regrets it.
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he had not found her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, which would have had any significant impact on her behaviour."
A prosecutor read a statement by Lynn Roy, Roy's mother, saying, "I haven't had a day to grieve for losing my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of everything I've done and I'm trying to stand with his sisters in all my pain, which will be with us forever " , saying...
Mr. Roy's sister, Cadyy Roy, testified that she was "spiritual" because she realized that she could never attend her brother's wedding or become his child's aunt.
"The loss of a man who has been with me since I was born is pain, and the rest of my life will be with it." She said.
This case seems to set a legal precedent, as the laws of Massachusetts do not criminalize the encouragement of others to commit suicide.
Roy was found dead in car carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014; this year, Carter was 17 years old.
Carter's text message revealed that she encouraged him to commit suicide and that the case attracted national attention.
"Standed, jumped, stabbed herself in a lot of ways... " she said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death; he was on vacation with his family.
During the time before he committed suicide, she wrote, "You need to do this, Conrad," and, "All you have to do is start the generator and then get free and happy."
Judge Monez said that Carter had drawn attention through the death of Mr. Roy and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There are differences of law in this case.
The few people defending Carter were Amanda Knox, one of whom she was charged with murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and acquitted two years later.
A 30-year-old Ms. Knox in a column published by the Los Angeles Times said, "Michel? Carter deserves compassion and help, not imprisonment."
Zhang is destined to be a controversial film artist, and since he started making his first film, "The Red Sorghum", he has also gained a lot of dissent while leading the Chinese film scene.

The BMW President said that BMW believed in "driving more intelligent choices than restrictions", meaning that major cities in Europe -- including Munich, where BMW has its headquarters -- were considering banning or limiting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that 3 million Mercedes cars in Europe would be converted to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed that this was a recall.
European automobile manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emissions requirements.
But nitrogen oxides emitted from diesel engines are considered carcinogens and may cause asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset diesel vehicle tail emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to maintain the price competitiveness of diesel vehicles.
As German car manufacturers faced scrutiny, the Government led by Prime Minister Angela Merkel was also accused of overexerting these powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.
These car companies are trying to avoid repeating the popular pattern of covering up the use of so-called failed devices, adjusting emissions during vehicle tests to comply with regulations and returning to normal driving conditions.
A number of public executives have been charged in the United States, while others are being investigated by countries on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zacero Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving the general public, and the German government accused Audi of installing a system to avoid European emissions requirements, expanding the scope of the investigation previously limited to the United States.
Audi's being investigated could have a major impact on the general public: luxury car manufacturers have a disproportionate share of profits on cars.
A movie from preparation to presentation, one or two or even a few years, is commonplace.
The animated film, Big Fish Seagull, was announced to be released on July 8th, 12 years from preparation to presentation!
The original author of the Great Fish Seagull, Liang Yiang, 21-year-old from the University of Qinghua, founded China with his friend Zhang Chun, and in 2008 received a million dollars worth of venture investment in joint ideas, and launched animated film troupe called the Big Fish Seagull.
The film has won many national and international prizes during the creative sample phase, and has been recorded and praised by the French Pompidou Contemporary Art Center as one of the most outstanding works of art.
For six years, from creativity to production, the film was called "the Godhole" by millions of fans looking forward to its appearance.
The Big Fish Seagull tells a fantastic story about Chinese people, and with the release of this slated preview, it brings new expectations to all viewers.
He said, "This is the only thing he's done in 12 years, and now it's turned from a dream to reality, and I'm nervous and excited."
Chang Chun says, "I'm driving the team crazy to make exactly the same picture with a 50% budget."
Toshio, a world factory that used to rely on raw materials processing and a large number of generalists, is looking at high-level people who can lead the city to reposition.
During the high-level talent campaign week in the city of Tokyo, the first financial journalist saw a number of powerful local businesses participating in a talent fair.
On billboards that are very bright under the orange and red background wall, they each mark the price.
Therefore, the Chinese Association of Television Production Industries decided to join the national television production industry and sign a convention on self-regulation.
Provence lavender is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has become the symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but there is bad news that it is threatened by climate change.
As a result of persistent drought and the presence of virus-borne insects, lavender is deteriorating, causing headaches among scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Institute of Agriculture in Provence, said: "The lavender of Provence is under great threat because in recent years the plant has been affected by climate change, spring rains have decreased significantly, and autumn is gloating.
This affects the life cycle of lavender.
There's also a small individual, a leafy leaf that can spread microbacterial bacteria, which in very dry weather can appear in large numbers ... "
The point is it's huge.
In addition to attracting vacationers, Qingya lavender is popular with perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chase says, "Contrary to the many big flowers we can open with long-sleeved seedlings, we have smaller individuals, stunted, missing or weak.
So we have less oil. "
The solutions being studied include the adoption of better irrigation techniques and the mitigation of soil evaporation, the spraying of soil and water-protective mixtures to plants, and the development of drought-resistant varieties.
Compared to the science fiction element in the film, the two starring scenes show that they're more attracted to stories in the film.
On the afternoon of 5 September, the journalist of the Washington City News, who continued to interview a number of prominent personalities in the vocal world and two other performing artists, was surprised to learn that they were almost unanimous in silence.
One is Berlin Shadow, one is an up-to-date young actor, and the word "psycho-crime" is the first partner of Léfan and Li Yi Feng.
Mexico is in danger. Journalists were killed.
The staff of Riodoce weekly usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting the riots in Sinalo, which were caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But today, the shadows of the tragedy plague themselves, and they come together to discuss security issues.
It's important that they be told to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what was more safe: whether to take their children to the office (which had been hit by a grenade in 2009) or leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemy, neutral and ally.
They have these reporters named under each column -- without proof, observation and intuition are enough.
Suspected drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on the government list, or cartels, these villains make Mexican reporting dangerous.
The violence continued unabated and the bodies were spread throughout the country, with a growing number of journalists: according to the Commission for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Péña Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists have been under federal protection following attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least 7 journalists have died in seven states.
The last person who died was their editor and inspiration, together with Javier Valdiz Cárdenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
Valdiz wrote a lot of books about drug violence, one of which he wrote: "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist."
You can feel that he's gone, even though he's everywhere -- a huge picture hanging on the front of the "Riodoce" office building, Valdiz with the middle finger and the word "Justice"; two 30-year-old journalists, Aaron Ivala and Miriam Ramirez, wearing a T-shirt with his smile, with his glasses or his branded Panamanian weed hat on.
The seminar took place less than two months after his death; journalists discussed their common wounds, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor ' s office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists ' cases, according to the records of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two persons were prosecuted by the office.
The vast majority of the thousands of crimes committed each year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, and the perpetrators of the murders of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they insist on reporting on violence in Sinalo, even though they're heartbroken, even though the land is full of wounds.
Ivala said there was no information about the killer, no justice, and it was not very useful to hold a security seminar.
He said, "What a stupid waste of time for a seminar like this.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone. "
On the morning of May 15, Valdiz left the "Riodoce" office in Culiacan, capital.
His red Toyota Carola drove a few blocks away and was stopped by two men; they forced him out of the car and fired 12 shots, presumably because of the newspaper's name, which translates into the 12th River.
The assailants left in his car and crashed it in the vicinity.
Valdiz is 50 years old.
Leave his wife and two adult children behind.
Curiacan gossips all over the place.
But there's nothing but silence about Valdiz.
Since Guzmán was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinalo has become the country's bloodiest battleground, and hostile forces have been killed.
One or more people were shot every day in the streets of Sinalo State, with a grave filled with two veritable tombs of drug lords, which are commonplace.
For the time being, forget the state of calm when only one cartel controls the coastal state and its ports and drug routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdiz was well aware of the dangers of the job, the 60-year-old "Riodoce" co-founder and director, Ismael Pohoqui, was guilty of failing to protect his friends.
He believes that two mistakes caused this tragedy.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, who led a cartel that fought with Guzmán's sons.
The story may have provoked the sons; the papers were bought off by suspected gang members as soon as they arrived at the newsstand.
The second mistake was that Valdiz was not forced to leave Mexico for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper covering the same story.
Valdiz is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great significance to Mexico's violence against journalists.
His spirit is long, and his friends and colleagues believe he's always with us.
He was also a senior journalist for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues in the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 dollars in shares.
In Sinalo, Pohoqui said, "It's impossible to get on the news without dealing with the drug problem."
With the passage of time, the newspaper has gained a good reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising have increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish reports without fear of censorship, and readers like to publish stories that no one else dares to report.
Five years after its inception, Riodoce won the Maria Moskapo Prize for Latin America.
The same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the Valdiz International Prize for Freedom of the Press in recognition of his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug story.
He said he was scared.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the prize, he said, "I want to live."
Later in late October, in an interview with the local television station Rompetiviento TV, he said, "Drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinalo County.
You have to take on the task of being a reporter -- either that's it, or you're deaf.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many deaths why don't you make a sound about what's happening?"
All the staff of Riodoce miss Valdez, remembering him as a dock worker, remembering this friend who never hugs and advises, miss this teacher who knows how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar across from the office, always sitting on the same table.
Now, they will ask: Is it his daily habits that caused him to fall?
His death has forced them to think about how to do their job and live their lives.
"They don't like you causing trouble for their women and children, nor do they like you affecting their legitimate companies and the secret airport used to deliver drugs."
It's all over their bottom line. "
As a result, even in the safest of times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-protection should be maintained.
Trust your instincts.
If you smell dangerous, get out of here.
Andres Villariel, editor of Riodoce, says the problem is, "The breath is a feeling of deception... and then something like that happens in Javier."
He and others have said that the previous rules no longer apply to Sinalo — just as they no longer apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where smuggling routes are lucrative and agencies are weak, government officials corrupt and smokey.
The situation is changing.
In the room where the staff of Riodoce participated in security training, mobile phones were suddenly not allowed; a few days earlier, spy software allegedly sold to the Government alone had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
Outside, two police officers took the cold under the shade, avoiding the temperature of 104 degrees.
They were sent by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce, located in a four-storey building in the middle class neighbourhood of Kuliacan.
Some reporters joke about the fact that these cops are 50 percent of what the governor says they belong to.
It's been months since journalists went to the mountains, where drug cartels are under real control.
Riodoce has been covering three major events this week.
Among them was the murder of the brother of Julio César Chávez, the great former boxer in Sinalo County.
There is also a disclosure of government funding from the governor's home town.
And the kidnapping in a expensive restaurant in Kuliacan, just a block from the prosecutor's office.
The official did not publish information about the abductees and the kidnappings, so writing about what the city knows needs to be cautious: the restaurant is where the drug dealers and the authorities love to go.
A journalist learned from public records that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician of the ruling Revolutionary System Party (PRI), which dominated the political class almost throughout the past year.
Recently, several Revolutionary Party governors were accused of corruption in several highly valued cases.
Villariel asked journalists to write about what happened at the scene of the incident, including the escape of one of the sons of Mexico's biggest drug lord, Guzman, from a military attack.
If a few months ago, readers looked at Valdez's column and looked for the most powerful information on the kidnapping.
46-year-old Villarill, who was called "Little Man" because he had a thin body, said, "We knew what had happened before.
Now all our sources of communication are cut off.
Valdiz's office is now being used to store signs and stickers to protest against the killing of journalists, because employees are what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed a sign and walked out of the room and went to the local prosecutor's office to attend a march in connection with another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdiz was killed in the western state of Michoacán.
The official found a burnt body and claimed that according to DNA tests, this was his body.
At the national level, journalists became more vocal, organized protests and put "Save the media" on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, Director Pohkwe is not in Washington, and he's trying to get justice and international support for the Valdiz case.
The day after Valdiz was killed, in a meeting with the Governor of Sinalo County, Ramirez accused the official of spying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth.
Given that her anger had affected her objectivity, she also asked to resign her position of reporting on government affairs.
Valditez has constantly reiterated that Mexican journalists are being organized to commit crimes, surrounded by government officials and unmindful societies.
In his last book, "Drug News", he wrote that journalists were not only mutilated by drug cartels, but also on lists of politicians and security forces involved in organized crime.
Media Watch Group Articulo 19 blames police and public officials for more than half of the attacks on journalists last year.
Ramirez said, "In Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up."
Apparently, these murders are very chilling.
No one forgets that six years ago, Lord Maria Elizabeth Macias died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was accompanied by a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my story."
Her head was cut off with a computer keyboard and headphone next to her.
After Miloslava Britch was killed in March, some newspapers opted to close down, like El Norte on the northern border of Chihuahua.
The others are still on, the directors of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo were killed in 2014, but they are still on.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez used a front page of the news to talk openly about the drug cartel, entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their homes or even left the country.
It's a tough choice.
It's hard to find jobs in exile, and they need to be careful in the streets and be wary of danger.
Sometimes they'll be arrested and reportedly killed three months after the 2015 photographer Ruben Espinosa fled Veracruz with four women in a Mexican city.
For those who work behind the scenes, this is a routine step in high-risk decision-making.
Ivala wanted to be a poet, and he admitted that reporting on the drug trade scared him.
He said, "Mexico is turning into hell, so I became a journalist."
In the middle of the last Friday, the latest edition of the newspaper was printed and the editors of Riodoce sat outside the office drinking beer, and suddenly their phone rang.
A series of gunfights between gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Massatland confirmed 19 deaths.
The war is escalating, as a series of cartel information discovered in the region portends.
They're uploading the news to Riodoce's website on the side of the road by phone.
The headline had to change the next day.
The siren rang around the area -- there was another shootout in the area.
Poho-kwei took a look at the guards there to see if they were alert.
If they're scared, they don't show up.
The founder of this newspaper has been killed, and in his large portrait, he points to where the entire Sinalo State needs to look, and the staff of Riodoce follows his footsteps.
"How could you even want to shut down? The same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her on the street."
China ' s self-drive tourism market size or trillion yuan in 2020
[Summary] In the broader context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free travel, self-tourism is encouraged by national policies and is increasingly favoured by consumers ...
But at the same time, there is a double challenge to break through the trillion-scale self-motivated market.
In the broader context of rising consumption and free travel, self-tourism is encouraged by national policies and is increasingly favoured by consumers.
At the same time, however, self-driving organizations, such as self-driving clubs and travel agencies, face a low level of profitability on the one hand, and self-driving infrastructure and services, on the other hand, are still at an early stage.
60 per cent of the total number of people in the country, and the market is expected to break by trillion.
In 2016, 4.44 billion domestic tourism trips took place throughout the year, about 60 per cent of the country ' s total number of domestic tourism trips, and the size of the self-drive market is expected to break out of trillion by 2020.
According to China ' s Association of Tourboats, the number of people travelling by car has continued to grow over the past five years, and the proportion of tourists travelling in the country has remained stable at over half.
At the same time, regional and national levels have shown greater interest in and support for the emerging area of self-drive, with policy regulations on self-driving, residential vehicles and camping and tourism intensifies between 2016 and 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Directorate of Tourism and the National Directorate of Sports, jointly issued the "Development Plan for Automobile Sports Camps"; in the same month, self-travel was highlighted in the Action Plan for the Promotion of Rural Tourism Development (2017), which was issued jointly by the Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance and 14 other departments.
The introduction of policies provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self-tourism.
The self-drive club has little profit, and the whole industry chain is the key.
While the country ' s self-driving market has great potential and national policies are actively guided, the self-driving industry is still in its early stages.
According to China ' s Annual Development Report for Self-Riding 2016-2017, there are thousands of car clubs, car clubs, friends ' associations, etc., but tourist self-help arrangements account for a large proportion of their own trips, participating in car clubs, and travelling clubs and other institutions such as auto clubs account for only about 15% of visitors.
At the same time, the number of online tourism enterprises and traditional travel agencies that develop autonomous self-drive products is high, and many online tourism platforms sell only self-drive products from suppliers and some self-drive clubs are important suppliers.
In terms of organizing self-drives, it covers multiple aspects of "eat, live, walk, swim, buy, entertain", high fragmentation, high upstream supply chains, and high random tourist consumption.
The founder of the Beijing Car Club and CEO Choi said that the self-drive club was essentially similar to the travel agency, and that the early main profit model was predominantly underline activities, with the core being self-drive line products and lead services.
However, there is now a high degree of homogenization of line products in the self-drive sector, varying levels of leadership services, and the self-drive club faces the need for a new transformation.
It can be seen that self-drive is not an independent industry in itself, but rather that it creates a cross-geographical, industry-based biosphere that is important to form a complete chain of industry by virtue of its own mobility.
Experts pointed out that, in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important consumer element.
Therefore, for the development of the self-drive industry, it is important to enhance the identity of the experience, to develop the theme of self-drive plus and IP for self-drive products.
The viewing road is not just a road. Car camps should not be just for food and accommodation.
In the face of the rise of the drive, the basic development of the journey is also relatively elementary.
According to Li Chunjie, tourist attractions are not just a road, but require the integration of transport and tourism elements, but both sectors are responsible for road repairs and tourism themselves, the transport sector adds tourism elements and stays in the construction of latrines, counselling centres, promotional columns, etc., which are not sufficiently integrated with tourism.
The construction experience is worth learning by comparing the well-known self-drive route "US 66."
The landscape design is no longer the most direct and rapid route between the place of departure and the destination, but is guided by the design concept of "Employing the pleasure of driving", which offers the best enjoyment for self-carried tourists of the beauty of the road; it links points, face-to-face tourism landscapes, preserving the historical and cultural value of ecotourism resources along the route, and organizing thematic events to enhance the participants' participatory and recreational experiences and create economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
In addition to the landscape, the camp is an important side-facilitating facility.
But there are not many consumers who choose to stay in camps among the self-motivated tourists that New Kyoto journalists know about.
In their view, many camps are in favour of infrastructure and are only able to feed and live at a low level, with a single product, and cannot meet the many elements of self-travel.
According to some of the industry that did not want to reveal names, many of the businesses that had been camped in previous years had been set up to collect land, after which the later stages of infrastructure construction and services had not been kept up to date, and many of the operations had been in a state of loss, without later infusion of funds, it had been difficult to produce the corresponding packages.
Consumption group
According to data published in 2017 by the China Association of Tourboats, age groups are concentrated in 21-40 years of age, especially 31-40 years of age, which have a certain economic base and a high demand for personalized tourism and are mostly parent-to-child travel clients.
According to the accommodation survey, the self-driving population is relatively preferred to non-standard accommodation.
In terms of self-drive type, self-drive is the most important type of self-drive, 84.32%.
It's a lot of people who want to leave the country, but it's a smaller share.
At the same time, as consumer demand rose, visitors who used to prefer to travel to "show and sleep" began to change their minds, no longer "get out of the car, get in the car and go to bed" but focused more on the experiences and processes of travel.
Dinosaurs use disguises to hide from their enemies.
At first glance, it's scary, but it looks like a statue.
Researchers published their first study of the incredible biochemicals found by Canadian miners, the size of rhinoceros, pointing out that the fossil was well preserved, so the experts called it "Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world".
The fossil is very well preserved, and it can even be determined that the colour of its stale skin is red and brown.
The report in Contemporary Biology describes it as "the best-saved placard dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered type of pulmonary dragon that lives between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the white age.
It's extremely well preserved and shocked the researchers, who describe it as "exaggerating."
According to the National Geographic Journal, this herb-eating pavilion dinosaur is the best-saved type of dinosaur ever found.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered this fossil at the Senkol Millennium mine near McMoryburg, Northern Alberta, Canada.
At the time, he ran into something that seemed different from the surrounding rocks, so he decided to look at it carefully.
After that, the fossil he found was sent to the Royal Terrill Museum of Life in Canada.
It took the researchers six years to show the real face of this beast inside the 2,500 pounds (1100 kg).
After all this hard work, it's only now that the final results are published.
"If you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping." The first author, Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Terrill Museum, said, "The creature is on display at the museum."
"It will be one of the most beautiful and perfect dinosaur specimens in scientific history - Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world."
By studying their skin, researchers found that the herbivores, although wearing armor, were like walking tanks, were at risk of major threats from meat-eating dinosaurs.
The dinosaurs wearing heavy armor used red and white disguises to escape predators, as well as covert techniques known as "backshade", which were also used by many modern animals.
In this way, experts say it can be better integrated with the surrounding environment, thus avoiding the enemy, indicating that it is captured by larger dinosaurs.
This 110 million-year-old creature belongs to the family of the Fine Dragons and became the headlines for the first time in May and is currently being displayed at the Royal Terrill Museum of Biology.
Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was a member of the team, took about 7000 hours to excavate the beast's veil, and the researchers now study it and name it "Borealopelta markitchelli".
The samples were extremely well preserved so that Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists could record the patterns and shapes of the scales and armors on their bodies.
They found the anti-shade technique, a common defense in the animal world, which means that the animal's back is darker than its side.
Although antishading is common, the results are surprising because the dinosaurs are much larger in size than the existing animals using antishade.
This dinosaur is under pressure to be hunted by meat-eating dinosaurs, which evolves in a positive direction, allowing it to hide in the opposite base as a means of survival.
However, most of the existing animals using anti-shading techniques, such as deer, zebra or zebra, are as small and vulnerable as prey, indicating that the creature is under real survival pressure.
"The wild preying of large heavy alpha dinosaurs shows how dangerous it is for white-collar meat-eating dinosaurs." Brown says.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin color is red and brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the life trail of the creature, including the stomach contents it retains to find the last food to feed.
They believe that dinosaurs fell into the river at the time of their death, were then washed into the sea and eventually sank into the sea in a back-down way.
At that time, Alberta's climate was as warm as it is today in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans could be deeper inland than they are now.
Brown says, "This Lumpy Dragon is truly amazing, because it is completely covered by preserved stair skins and, so far, preserved in space so that its original shape can be preserved."
"So the creature is now almost identical in shape to that of the white age.
You don't have to rebuild it with too much imagination; if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping. "
The White Age is a time when giant animal foot dinosaurs walk around the planet.
Although the Tyrannosaurus is the king of the dinosaurs, it only appeared millions of years after the Picard dinosaurs, which may have been captured by some of the ancestors of the Tyrannosaurus.
They're high thorn dragons, a giant beast of 6 tons, 38 feet (11.5 metres).
The latest study found that scientists in Contemporary Biology believed that the knot dragon had been washed into the sea after his death and had formed mummies in the mud.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink dug up the creature at the Millennium mine near McMurleyburg, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it's the world's best preserved paicure dinosaur, full of skin and armor from the nose to the hips.
The average size of this creature is about 18 feet (5 metres) and weighs 3000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It's got two 20 inches long, sharp angles from the shoulder.
According to researchers, this herbal pavilion is operating in the current western part of Canada and is then washed into the sea by a flood of rivers.
But this dinosaur is buried on the sea floor to keep its coat intact.
The fossil remains of this special sample are very well preserved so that the residual skin still covers the diaphragm of the skull of the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine, this preservation is very rare, like the middle color.
The more I look, the more I find it incredible.
The residue of the skin fossils is still covered by the coated armor on the skull of the dinosaur.
Its right front palm is on its side and its five toes are up.
I can count his nails. "
Journalists learned that the incorporation of natural or plant-based seaweed acids, corrosion acids and amino acids in the urea production process allowed for the adaptation of traditional urea, resulting in an increase of 5-10 percentage points in the use of urea for urea, zinc corrosive urea and urea for urea.
Environmentally friendly, crop production potential is clear, especially for large particles of value added urea, which is a good raw material for BB fat.
This total number of security personnel is twice as high as the number of security guards at the 2012 London Olympics.
In order to ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest security connection ever.
Previously, the Brazilian Government indicated that a total of 85,000 people from the army and the police would fight together, including 20,000 troops and 65,000 policemen.
The majority of the military will be responsible for the protection of Olympic stadiums, while the additional 3,000 troops will be responsible for the security of international airports, subway stations and streets.
The police patrol other parts of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
It is known that 6,000 soldiers have arrived in Rio to serve Olympic security.
They are responsible for patrolling the airport and the main road connecting the airport to the Olympic grounds, in addition to the four major areas of the Rio Olympic Games.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service industry is no longer new, and in order for evaluation mechanisms to be effective, it is important to make regulation more effective and non-formal.
How radicals learn to answer this question: "Whose street?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrer was troubled.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, this St. Louis man sat in Episode's rental bed, browsing Facebook on his cell phone.
She accidentally found a post from a high school student.
It says, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid who was lying on the street."
She was confused when she found that no one else had published the message on the feed.
A @ThePharaah user keeps sending her the Dynamic Times.
Michael Brown was an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He put on a picture of Brown's body lying on the street and his body was lying on the street for four hours.
"Damn," Ferrer thought.
But death is not new to her and her community.
She dropped her cell phone and didn't turn on Twitter until the other night to read the tweets about the crowd gathering on Canfield Avenue.
There's a police video and people shouting photos, and there's a photo of a man who claims to be Brown's father, which says, "Policies Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feed and a policeman standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
She said in another video, another cop raised his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all of you... beasts."
"It's not normal," said Ferrer in his memory.
"It's not our custom to call it a typical murder. "
At that moment, I felt chilly.
I'm angry, I'm crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
In the next three years, what happened to Ferrer and Ferguson was the theme of a new documentary "Who's Street?" that was filmed at the cinema in August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the perspective of those who live in this community and are crowded with streets and streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter (in a flower dress, in a coronation), they re-discussed the many times they had discussed before that morning -- "about the black experience and the black situation."
"Do you remember when I taught you when black people had to fight for their faith?" She recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, which is wrong.
I had to take her with me, "Freyer later."
"What happened today was the climax of everything in the past.
She needs to know, see and rise from this.
She needs not only to develop positively and organizationally, but also to understand the different dimensions of black experiences and black situations and what we have to do to be free and free.
Even if I had the honour of offering her a racist experience she had not experienced personally, she was no different from any other black girl.
If I protect her in this matter, I think I'm hurting her. "
They arrived at the first stop of Ferguson at a site opposite the South Florida Road Police Department.
Ferrer and her daughter contacted a local business owner who made bag lunch.
They've got a bag ready to pass it to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to form a new kind of activism.
She said, "My radicalism changed completely after August 9th." "When she was studying at St. Louis, Missouri State University, she was president of the Association of Nurses and Nurses of Minorities, focusing on the food justice and health disparities in the black community.
"I don't have organizational experience.
This is all going to happen. "
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with film co-director Sabah Fryyan during a night march.
Flayan said she and her photographer Lucas Alvarado Falle "just wanted to record what happened."
One of the questions that comes up in Ferrer's mind: "Do you want to record or find a story you can use?"
This suspicion stems from many cases in which people, usually whites, enter a community to benefit from their pain and resilience.
As Fryon explained in his last interview, "We heard that the natives of Ferguson did not concentrate their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."
Flayan has contacted the co-director, Damon Davis, a regional artist known for radicalism against prisoners on death row.
His involvement brought Ferrer along with six other locals to join the "Who Street?" project team, which remained in place for several years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary wasn't spoken to or talked to us. It was our speech." Davis said.
"I'm concerned about how these people are presented, because that's how I'm presented."
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrer's experience — but to show that the campaign is not about the Savior's leader, but about community cohesion — Flejan says — she proved to be the most open to film participants.
And as a result, "Who's Street?" was a surprising record of Ferrer's personal life, like falling in love and getting married.
"I felt naked, "Freyer laughed when he first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that doing this and humanizing black people requires a certain degree of vulnerability. "
Moreover, Ferrer's story reaffirms and repositions the role of black cool women in the wider black life event movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- the creation of #BlackLivesMatter on social media following the 2012 shooting of the black teenager Trevor Martin -- were identified as cool.
"Black cool women in leadership generally support this movement," said Ferrer, "because we fight on multiple fronts.
Black cool women have to live with this. "
"This movement is really supported by black women and many black cool women."
Because of her identity, Ferrer was chosen as the core of the film.
"She's the one who inspired this energy," she said.
"She's on the front line, but it's not a coincidence... because in these crossroads, as a black cool woman, you have a lot to do.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy. "
At the same time, in Ferguson, news cameras have long disappeared, but ethnic tensions between the community and the police persist.
Ferrer was given a suspended sentence of two and a half years for attempting to block the highway during a demonstration.
She described the socio-political atmosphere in what she called home: "A mess."
Nevertheless, since she went to Ferguson's street three years ago, she has been insisting on the holy song she tried to remember.
"It is our duty to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We can no longer lose except the shackles of our bodies. "
In fact, an online translation service was available on the Internet 10 years ago, and it was a long time ago that the argument that machines were about to replace humans for translation was heard.
Similarity: Artists use Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
There are multiple faces in the center of the museum in Friedman, New York: white, black and brown, each face has almost undetectable similarities, and these faces are tied by ropes drawn down from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Duway Hagborg using Chelsea Manning's cheek tampons and hair scraps.
Manning sent hair scraps from Livingworth Fort Prison, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking confidential diplomatic cables via WikiLeaks website.
The exhibition opened on August 2nd under the title "Similarity".
This is the result of two years of communications between Dewey Hagburg and Manning, Dewey Hagburg, who combines his discipline with his own technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a well-known dissident who has been imprisoned and who has completed a sex change surgery in prison.
And by doing an arithmetic analysis from Manning's DNA, and by creating 30 portraits of "probably possible appearances," Heather Duway Hubberg made a very sharp and somewhat heartless comment on the concept of DNA, as well as on identity itself.
Manning was born under the name Bradley Edward, who publicly admitted that he was a woman at puberty... was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including 6 espionage offences, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was repressed, with only one picture, a picture of herself with a grain of black and white, apparently uneasy, sitting in a driver's seat, wearing a golden wig.
In 2015, Heather Dewey Harborg had a great success in her 2012 project "Stranger Visions."
In that work, she used DNA taken from cigarette butts and gum secondary court exhibits, from scraps, to create images of possible similar 3D characters.
That's an e-mail she just got from Paper magazine.
"They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and need a portrait " , Heather Duway Hubberg said to the press at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning couldn't visit or take pictures, so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making DNA portraits.
So this artist and her imprisoned muse became impossible pen pals and exchanged many letters over two years.
They even created a comic book, "The Depressed Head", drawn by Shoili Kanungu. The comic book envisaged that the President would grant Manning privileges in the future and that she would be able to see the exhibition in prison.
And Obama asked for her release just a few days after the book was published. It was a coincidence, perhaps, that Manning spent the seventh year in Kansas Military Prison.
In addition, this exhibition has another dimension, because in contemporary America, the Trump government continues to declare war on government leaks and transgender soldiers, while finding new ways to brag on Twitter in order to incite division, which the exhibition is trying to bridge.
When asked about all this extraordinary time, Heather Dewey Hubberg said, "Anything happens for a reason."
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's superb signature is down there, calling for an end to the "likes of parties based on sex, sexual orientation and culture."
On the wall is her mitochonoid DNA sequence, which is written with pencils to twist Cs, Gs and As symbols.
With 200 letters (or nucleic acids, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Heather Duway Hubberg wants to express that by depicting these strangely similar portraits, at least in the physical structure, everyone is.
"I hope that people get out of this dilemma, that our genome doesn't care who we are, how open genetic data are interpreted, how subjective it is. "
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so this is 30 of them."
The last piece of the exhibition, in a room, came from a page in a novel in the illustrations.
It shows the American soldiers who brag under the loudspeaker, the manning of the Golden Kong.
"When they stop your speech, they win." It says on the wall.
"So don't shut up."
"The content came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I'm just scared again, and I'm still gonna say it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person, as foreseen in the comic book, but when she does, she'll get her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters cheering in the center of the gallery.
It's also purposeful, just like all the items in the exhibition, to reach the height of her genetic single-team information written in pencils (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
"In the past, I put them on the wall, but I want them to feel like a group of people." Dewey Hagburg, speaking of portraits, said.
"But I want them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people were protesting about her release. "
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder.
According to the police, a man was found fatally stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago and a Northwestern university professor and an Oxford university employee were subsequently wanted and are currently searching for suspects throughout the country.
Cook County Court records show that on Monday, 42-year-old Wendham Lacem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were arrested for the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranto for murder without bail.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell Duranlo died of multiple stab wounds.
According to a community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27th.
The police got a phone call and arrived at Grand Plaza's apartment and found a number of fractures on the victim's body.
According to the police, Cornell Durando died instantly, the detective is investigating the murder, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lesam has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mail statement, Alan K. Kobaki, Deputy Director of Campus Relations, stated that Lesam had now been separated from his post and had been banned from the University of Northwestern campus.
Kobaki says, "Now it's a criminal case, and the authorities are investigating it, and the University of Northwestern is actively cooperating with the investigation."
Warren's a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
In an e-mail statement, the spokesman for the Summerville College at Oxford University said: "We have been in contact with the British police and stand ready to assist, as required, the United States investigative agencies. "
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would turn himself in.
The Chief Liaison Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guellermi, strongly encouraged suspects to surrender to the authorities.
Gullermi says, "The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and we're trying to locate possible locations."
Güllermi indicated that local, regional and national authorities were fully assisting in the search of suspects.
Gullermi said that the police had received a call from the manager of Grand Plaza's apartment, and that he had just received a secret tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police said it was terrible.
Güllermi says it's still unclear whether this incident also occurred on July 27.
According to security cameras, it was confirmed that Lesam and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Lacem has something to do with the victim."
Grand Plaza ' s management team issued a statement to the residents that: "The police are currently studying the victim ' s time line and background and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident. "
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Muteko said, "We will complete the road map for the world anti-doping agency in the near future."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Muteko stated that the implementation of the remaining standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for restoring the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would not take long.
"The implementation of the road map standards has reached a certain stage and RUSADA has acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA Road Map was updated in this regard. "Muteco Thursday says.
Deputy Prime Minister Muteco made the above statement in his comments on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency road map, Compliance. This part sets out the criteria for restoring RUSADA rights and was recently posted on the organization's website.
According to Muteco, the criteria do not contain anything that could cause Russian concern.
He added, "Everything has to be announced, everything will be done.
and will submit the results to the IOC [IOC] and WADA in the near future. "
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency must publicly accept the findings of a survey approved by Canadian lawyer Richard McCallen concerning the support of the Russian State for the use of stimulants in national sports by WADA ...
Speaking of this, Muteco said, "We're investigating that our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind it, and we will not admit what does not exist. "
Muteko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Independent Public Anti-Doping Committee of Russia.
Smirnov acknowledged the past problems of the Russian anti-doping agency during a media interview earlier that day, but added: "We have said on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and provisions.
No one planned to accept the report unconditionally, "Smirnov said.
After the November 2015 stimulant scandal, WADA suspended the right of RUSADA to carry out stimulant screening in Russia.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate tests this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
When he visited the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, the Director-General of WADA, Olivia Negrey, said that RUSADA was "going in the right direction" and striving to restore its rights.

In an interview, the President of the Croatian Football Association, Davao Souk, said that participation in the Chinese Cup was very interesting for Croatian football, and that the Chinese Cup had a very large number of prizes.
No more surrogates! There's zero tariffs on more than 8,000 products.
At a regular press conference organized by the Ministry of Commerce on 11 January, the Ministry of Commerce press spokesman had a high level of information that, to date, 15 self-trade agreements had entered into force, covering 23 countries and territories and covering more than 8,000 zero-tariff imports.
At the same time, imports of cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean wine, tropical fruits from ASEAN don't have to be bought at a high price.
At present, 16 free trade agreements have been signed with 24 countries and territories, and 15 have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 zero-tariff imports.
In the case of agricultural products, with the implementation of the FTA, consumers are able to taste agricultural products of good quality and low prices from different areas of production every four months.
For example, in ASEAN, tropical fruits such as durians, twigs, falcon fruit, import tariffs are reduced from 15 to 30 per cent to zero.
(a) The tariffs on imports of Icelandic salmon have been reduced from 10 to 12 per cent to zero;
(b) Red wine in Georgia and Chile, with tariffs on imports reduced from 14 to 30 per cent to zero;
New Zealand's beef and milk powder and other special agricultural products have significant tax cuts.
In the case of industrial goods, for example, part of the Swiss cosmetic import tariff has been reduced to zero;
(a) Some of the watch import tariffs have been reduced by 50 per cent and will be reduced to zero in a few years;
Korea ' s import tariffs on such products as refrigerators, cooking pans, massage machines and beauty salons have been reduced by 40 per cent and will be reduced to zero in a few years ' time;
And consumer-type electronics and so on, there's a bigger tax cut.
At the same time, zero-tariff products under the FTA include intermediate products and raw materials required for the manufacture of many domestic end-use consumer goods and have contributed to some extent to the structural upgrading of domestically produced consumer goods.
The Ministry of Commerce press spokesman had a peak that almost one third of all imports into the country were covered by the preferential tariff regime of the FTA, most of which was final consumer goods, and which had a real benefit for consumers.
Further reduction of tariffs on imports of consumer goods
With effect from 1 December 2017, we have adjusted tariffs on imports of some consumer goods to further lower tariffs on imports of consumer goods, covering food, health-care products, medicines, day-care supplies, footwear, household equipment, cultural entertainment and other types of consumer goods, covering 187 tariff numbers.
The average tax rate for this consumer product will be reduced from 17.3 per cent to 7.7 per cent, almost "stopping"!
Since 1 January 2018, we have also made partial adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
Lippas, eye shadow, and tariffs on imports of some cosmetics, such as perfume, were reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent;
Lowering tariffs means that consumers don't have to buy, let alone go all the way out to buy their favorite foreign products.
2018 U.S. Commodity Shopping Festival: Importing wine, snacks, fruit... all cheap!
Expiry: At year's end, the U.S. malls are very different.
China-New Network, December 29th.
According to the American Daily News, just after Christmas, there's a retreat.
According to the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), about half of the merchandise sold last Christmas was retorted.
In addition, readers have been defrauded on several occasions and consumers need to be careful when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable return procedures, but when buying gifts or electricity from small shops, they have to be careful.
Ms. Huo of Rolandon bought a coat on December 1st at an online shop specializing in stamp jackets, which was 60-odd (US dollars, under) and which has not yet arrived.
She e-mailed the customer's service and didn't answer.
There's also an Internet friend who traveled to the United States last year to buy a cell phone from a third-party seller and found it in a box of rubber mud.
When you know you're being cheated, apply for a refund from the website, so you can get a full refund.
But there were customers who thought that the website refund service wasn't 100% perfect.
Mr. King of Chinese Residents of Northern California said that he had purchased two emergency distribution services for a website and four dollars for an emergency service, but had never arrived on time.
And then I applied for a refund, and I didn't get a response.
Big malls or shopping malls have better return policies.
Most Macy's merchandise is refunded in full within 180 days.
However, the goods must remain as they were and must have purchase vouchers such as receipts or bank purchase records.
In the absence of a certificate, the customer can also obtain a market score that can be used for the purchase of other commodities.
Target usually has a 90-day refund period for ordinary goods, usually electronics for 15 days.
However, electronic purchases from 1 November to 25 December 2017 were extended to 30 days for the return of entertainment goods.
It should be noted that the 30-day refund period starts on December 25th, which means the return is due by January 25th, 2018.
It's a great shopping experience. A new era for shopping in the business world has come.
More than a decade ago, our country was generally in the seller's market, with limited options and limited demand.
But after 10 years of development, the market has long shifted from the seller's market to the buyer's market, and the consumer's taste has become worse, and they are no longer content with simple "one-hand-on" shopping.
So how to give consumers a great shopping experience becomes the next competition for real estate developers.
And among the many factors that affect consumer shopping experiences, shopping centres in the business world are the most influential.
See how city builders focus on shopping experiences everywhere.
There are no two completely identical leaves in the world, and there are no two completely identical shopping malls. A famous shopping mall necessarily has its own characteristics.
For example, the world-famous Kanyon shopping mall in Turkey, whose unique wave-shaped architectural design was inspired by Canyon, was named Kanyon, who walked in the 200-metre walk of Middle Kanyon as if he were in the Grand Canyon.
In addition to canyon-style designs, there is a large elliptical field in the center of the mall, which is unique in shape and often features.
The open platform was designed to allow tourists to walk on every floor and look down at the activities of the Gorge, with the effect of a change of scenery.
At home, the Nanjing Forest Moor Commercial Street, known as China's first forestwalking consummation, combines shopping with ecology, and fairy tales are perfect.
7000 square metres Green Square, 3,000 square metres roof water platform. The project consists of nine single-body buildings, air-column links between buildings, a whole sinking courtyard design, and the French groves above the terrain are the tops of the building, roofs of the water, creating a forest-like feeling.
Walking into the forest Moor is like falling into a rabbit hole in Alice's wonders, climbing the trunks surrounding the building, the grass, the springs, bringing people into the forest of life and vitality.
Also, in Chongqing, the Yingcai water business community, built by Lung Lake, plans to bring in more than 50 international top-selling flagships, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 national and foreign brands to become a conglomerate of service industries, with a prominent business centre.
In addition, the Merchant Circle of Merchants of Merit is also involved in ecological integration into buildings, with a combination of fashion shopping, living services, catering, recreation, education and sports, while also providing consumers with a unique shopping experience and leading them to enjoy a unique "waterfront culture" that combines shopping with water recreation and recreation.
On the basis of this, it can be seen that a number of housing enterprises are now familiar with the discovery trajectory of this new urban business, and industry sources suggest that this consumption model, centred on consumer experience, how to combine shopping with experience, will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
The business world now is not just a confluence of goods, but more a complex place where art culture is integrated, where creative themes are integrated, and where people are responsible for urban settlements.
Therefore, while meeting the needs of consumers for one-stop shops, maximizing the multilayered spiritual need for the transmission of culture and art, and the need for habitable housing, must be high points for the future development of the business community.
In Chongqing, the nation's north bank is located north of the river, close to the bridge, close to the world's commercial conglomerate, surrounded by international giants and brands, and connected to international fashion.
There's a lot of ground here, and there's a lot of ground in the world.
Toshihara has a better shopping environment. Toshihara is close to the South Lawn Business Circle and has a four-storey traffic system that is leading the west and even the country, increasing the comfort of shopping.
(b) Greening of the gardening of two additional walk-through roads and Vanda Square, with the upgrading of the landscape, the planting of approximately 300 logs, the remodelling of 40,000 square metres and the upgrading of the South Lawn business community;
And Lake Long Lake One, near Chongqing's first low-density waterfronting business circle, surrounded by nine parks, with low density in commercial neighbourhoods and high openness, makes people more willing to stay, stay, enjoy the fun of shopping, rather than be held by the rest of them rushing to make a real "walk shopping".
Today's commercial competition will only get stronger, and it will be worth serious thinking by all real estate developers about how to kill a blood trail in a homogenous market and win the reputation of a shopping shrine in the hearts of future consumers.
It is not enough simply by means of differentiated strategies, and only those developers who really really put consumers in their minds, rush consumers, think consumers want to give consumers a very easy shopping experience, can laugh in the market when the storm comes.
Of course, at the end of the day, I think it's the people of Chongqing who have such good shopping experience and business circles that no one can imagine today's prosperity 10 years ago.
Episode: Consumerism's Carnival to Hide Real Environmental Prices
16,82.2 billion dollars, November 11, 2017, 24 hours of the "Sky Cats 11 Global Carnival", in which Skycat users pay.
Specifically, when the double 11 starts, the cat's deal breaks 10 billion in 3 minutes, over 20 billion in 6 minutes and 05 seconds, and 100 billion in 9 hours.
On that day, the total number of payments made by consumers worldwide through the payment of treasures amounted to 1.48 billion, an increase of 41 per cent over the previous year.
This consumption will bring 812 million logistics orders.
And whether Sky Cat buys platforms or pay-for-money platforms, it belongs to the Ali Group in Maeun.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that on November 11, single youth, made out of self-defeating sarcasm, the subculture of "Light Stick Day" would be incorporated by electric dealers into today's phenomenal "Boy 11" shopping carnival.
On November 11, 2009, Ali Baba used the first marketing stunt of the "Light Stick Festival": no one's in love with you, so the "single dog" come and buy it online.
It turns out, this day, Pony City had a trade of 52 million dollars, 10 times the amount of the day's daily trade.
Since then, double 11 has become a shopping carnival built by Ali Baba, with domestic buyers entertaining themselves from the beginning to the current influx of global merchants, nine years later, with Skycats trading more than 3,200 times the amount of $1 billion that year, making Black Friday too much to see.
It's a double 11 salesman, and there's a lot of power dealers, of which Kyodong is the strongest.
"Kyoto" has his own shopping festival 6.18, but it doesn't have the effect of double 11, which lasts from November 1 to November 11 this year, and the cumulative sales of "Kyoto" amount to $12.7 billion.
And after the double 11s, it's followed by a similar double 12 party, Christmas New Year shopping.
After New Year's, there's Chinese consumers waiting for the year before Spring, Valentine's Day shopping, consumption, no vacations.
The environmental implications of instantaneous consumption have been brought to the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua's daily telecommunications report, at least 300,000 tons of garbage were generated this year during the "double 11" period, based on a conservative estimate of the normal standard of 0.2 kg per box in industry.
Liu Hua, Director of Pollution Prevention and Control, Greenpeace East Asia Division, told the China-China Dialogue that this year ' s double 11-only cat order would produce 160,000 tons of packaged garbage.
In 2016, the National Post Office issued a report stating that the 2015 "Bond 11" period (11-16 November) had a fast mass of approximately 780 million pieces, using more than 3 billion woven bags, 9,922 million boxes and 16,985 million metres of duct tape, which could circle 425 laps around the Earth's equator.
And this year, the National Postal Agency expects more than 1.5 billion copies of the double 11 Express.
Wang, manager of a waste incineration centre in Beijing, told Xinhua Society that every day after two 11s, more than 2,000 tons of garbage came in, and that it exceeded the capacity of the burning station.
The express delivery company has realized that the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry is not insignificant.
A number of electrical logistics companies, including Suning, introduced recyclable plastic express boxes before "Bond 11" that could be reused as a shopping bag and a garbage bag, etc., but the troublesome consumer acceptance was not very high.
Ma Yun also called on the logistics industry to support Green Packaging and Green Logistics in his tweets.
This microblogging has generated more than 68,000 "sweet."
What kind of mobile payment do the Germans want?
Zhang Winterside: The mobile payment battle in Germany is not looking forward to it.
We don't pay and pay but we move the battlefield to Europe, and the rivals don't change, nor do they take positions — the Chinese — and it's also global?
Where there is a payment treasure, there must be a micro-payment.
Under an agreement with Wirecard, an electronic payment service provider in Germany, the micro-credit payment officially started landing in Germany in November of this year and is gradually being laid out by businesses in Europe.
This foreign encounter between the two "Once" took place in Europe.
All along, payment of treasures and micro-credits were singing on the path to globalization.
In terms of China's globalization of mobile payments, Irene's advisory study on the Chinese third-party mobile payments industry, 2017, concluded in two ways: through strategic investment, export of experience, equity and support for foreign home-grown mobile pay enterprises.
The second is the promotion of mobile payment services to foreign traders through the consumption behaviour of Chinese tourists abroad, thereby changing the perception and acceptance of China ' s move payments by foreign countries.
It's true, the Chinese have to live.
China’s rapid economic development, coupled with a large population base, is an attractive figure for Chinese tourists in Europe.
But it's also fated that this Chinese mobile payment battle in Germany is not expected.
Is it also global that the payment of micro-credit and the payment of treasures merely moved the battlefield to Europe, that the rivals have not changed, that the positions seized have not changed — or that of the Chinese?
More pioneering is the question of whether China ' s mobile payments can open its borders on European soil.
Take Germany, for example.
"The New Retail" enchanted.
Chen Jianxian: Amazon announces entry into bookstores and grocery stores, regardless of timing or motivation, as he pushes into the 10 largest retailers around the world.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first real bookshop in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and Santiago.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened a shop in New York and plans to have at least eight by the end of the year.
At almost the same time, Amazon announces that no-man supermarket (Amazon Go) will run on a trial basis, that customers will not have to line up at the store, that they will not have to close their accounts, that they will take the goods they want, and that the purchase money will automatically be deducted from the client's Amazon account.
As far as the Amazon is concerned, it's an unexpected thing to suddenly move around the real store in recent years.
Because, as early as 2007, in an "open letter to shareholders", CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that the Amazon would not open a real shop easily unless the following four conditions were met:
1. We must be convinced that this new opportunity will give shareholders a return on their investments;
2. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great significance to the company as a whole;
3. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
We must be convinced that in this market we have sufficient resources to make customer-oriented differences.
Bookshops and grocery stores are the most rocky sort of retail sales in both entities and the first to fall in the Amazon.
Amazons announce their entry into both entity markets, regardless of timing or motivation, as they squeeze into the world ' s 10 largest retailers.
Was the Amazon practice contrary to the pledge contained in the shareholders' letter?
On the morning of 13 October 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou Clouds Congress, President Maroon of the Board of Directors of Alibaba gave a keynote address.
He said, "From next year, Ali Baba will stop talking about "e-commerce."
The era of pure power providers will soon end, and there will be no e-commerce in the next 10 years, replacing it with "New Retail".
A combination of online and logistics will generate new retail sales ... "
At one point, the word "new retail" was like being enchanted and hung up by the industry.
But what exactly does "new retail" mean?
If it's just a combination of the finger and the line, then it's not a novel concept.
In 2016, eMarketer tracked 180 of the largest electricity suppliers and estimated the total sales to be about $200 billion, of which the top 25 accounted for more than $159 billion.
Of these 25, 18 are traditional retailers that have only been operating online for the last five years (e.g., Macy's department, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
The Al-Babab Group is also known for its $28.3 billion investment in Sunning.
Globally, retailers and electricians are moving from a single channel to an all-channel retail system covering real shops, electricians, mobile end and social media.
Is Mavunti's New Retail more a summary than a vision of the future?
If not, what is the difference between the whole channel concept and "new retailing"?
Perhaps the point is not whether or not there's a connection between the line and the line, but how.
Looking back at the past 20 years of retail trade, the rise of electricity suppliers, like the rise of early-year discounted retailers, focused on prices and facilities.
With these two pain spots, the electric operator moved highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, from the bottom of the line to the bottom of the line.
With the development of on-line consumption habits and increasing customer experience, electricians reach out to other groups of goods and begin to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang, "The use of Internet ideas and technologies to overhaul and upgrade the existing stock of about 30 trillion social retailers makes it possible to effectively meet the rising consumer demand of China ' s consumers, making the process of production, circulation and servicing of goods as a whole more efficient because of the Internet ... "
So the road for the electrician is a superficial asset, an actual asset-intensive road.
"Light" means that the burden of fixed assets, staffing, management processes, etc. is not high in the traditional retail trade; "heavy" means that significant inputs are needed in logistics, warehousing, etc.
The changes in logistics have ensured the efficiency of the electric power provider.

On 18 January, in Chongqing, Ali Baba held a high-level dialogue on the eradication of poverty among electricity traders, which announced the promotion of poverty eradication and rural revitalization through the exploration of a new "Internet+poverty" model.
This is a new addition to Ali's fight against poverty, following the introduction of a rural strategy, the launching of the rural treasure-hunting project, the online farmers' anti-poverty platform and the establishment of the Ali Baba Poverty Eradication Fund.
The fight against poverty is one of China's most important national strategies.
The total eradication of poverty has never been achieved in China in the last few thousand years.
" The alleviation of poverty by electronics is an innovative new round of pro-poor development and an important catch-up for achieving precision poverty alleviation and poverty eradication. "
Central attention has been given to the role that the Internet can play in contributing to the fight against poverty, promoting precision in poverty reduction, precision in poverty eradication and the release of agricultural products from the countryside through the Internet ... "
As a result, as early as 2014, Ali proposed a rural strategy with big data cloud computing and globalization as three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the Rural Treasure Project to recruit Village 2 in the village and lead farmers out of poverty through electricity dealers.
In 2017, Ali worked with the business sector to create a pro-poor channel for agriculture and agriculture, which now brings together 13 provinces across the country and 120 poor counties at the national level.
Ali's platform gave birth to 2,118 treasure-hunting villages.
Of these, close to 400 are found in poor districts in the provinces and 33 in poor districts in 13 countries.
In 2017, on the Arababa Chinese retail platform, the country ' s treasure-hunting village sold 120 billion yuan.
Zhang Yong stated that, in the face of a national strategy to fight poverty, Ali had been thinking about how to use the technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovative capabilities of the Ali economy to make a new way out of poverty.
Among them, Murakami is the main carrying platform of Ali's electricity dealer out of poverty and runs a direct Internet link out of poverty.
In the planting chain, village caterers and ants gold uniforms jointly support farming tools and micro-credits.
In 2017, 795 ants served in 832 poor counties at the national level, providing easy payment, credit, etc.
The rookie settles storage and logistics, the cat sells, and the big data on Ariyun is directed at agricultural production, further improving the standards of supply, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The growth of electricity dealers out of poverty requires not only products, marketing channels, industrial planning, but also human resources.
Ali has achieved a combination of "poverty plus mental support" through the University of Bao Po, which offers electricity vendor courses to teach farmers standardized, quality and scale-based cultivation methods to enable farmers to escape poverty on a sustainable basis.
These courses already cover about 92% of the poor counties at the national level.
And the idea of a public good mentality, business instruments, to get out of poverty, will also guarantee that Ali will be "pro-poor".
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Alibaba, Ma Yun, said that poverty eradication should be divided into three phases: poverty eradication, poverty eradication and enrichment.
It's about giving people fish. It's about getting rid of them. It's about making a fish pond for farmers.
The power-driven industry is pro-poor. It's made of fish ponds.
In the area of industrial poverty alleviation, the model of poverty alleviation in the Los Angeles Apple Industry, developed by Ali in cooperation with Tsang Si Lochuan, has been replicated throughout the country as an example by the authorities.
Ali's power provider's efforts to reduce poverty have also been recognized at the decision-making level.
The electricity company, represented by Alibaba, was sent a message to ensure that farmers increased their yields through online and offline channels.
Some village Xiaoji and ant gold uniform workers were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experiences of electricity vendors lifting out of poverty.
At present, the United Nations World Food Programme ' s China Office has been working with Murakami to reduce poverty in electricity industries such as Anhui.
The Third Congress of the New Economic think tank was held on January 16, co-organized by the Ali Institute, the Chinese Vision think tank, with Zhang Li, Director of the Academy of Electricity, Ministry of Commerce, attending and making a statement.
She believes that the most important issues that we are missing from globalization are the nature and use of globalization and the stage of globalization.
There are many who believe that globalization has stagnated and that many developed and developing countries have different attitudes to globalization in the new phase, as well as different patterns.
The second is the question of the medium-term phase of globalization, and what are the constraints on the medium-term phase of globalization?
The economic environment is constrained precisely by the changes in the economic base that have taken place as a result of globalization.
According to Zhang Lei, the global economic adjustment was largely over by the end of 2017, and a new growth period would be in place after 2018, with the next growth having to be a raw product.
The 7FRESH, the first home in Kyoto, has opened recently and plans to open more than 1,000 shops throughout the country over the next three to five years.
Add Ali's box of horses, eternal superspecies, Sonin's, the American fish, and so on, the New Retail Door started to pile up and call each other out on innovative models and even prices.
The fight for the escalation of the fresh supermarkets has become a phenomenonal issue in the new retailing field, where is the new retailing?
"In 2018, we will quickly enter the country, and in Beijing, Shanghai, by Spring Festival, Hangzhou will open a whole bunch of shops."
"The new game" of 2018 was revealed at the 2nd Retail Summit.
"As of 2018, the boxhorse was not merely a feeder, but a consumer's immediate consumer.
Underneath the core mode is the current, experience, the net is the real sale. "
It's different from the traditional big malls, supermarkets, boxes of horses, in the eyes of a lot of consumers, that's a fun red shop, and even an agency has developed the concept of boxrooms.
Both online power platforms and offline retailers have advantages and disadvantages, while consumers appear in multiple channels, so both are trying to make a full-channel model.
The industry believes that, in the larger context of rising consumption, there will be more and more shops in 2018.
And the new year, when the boxhorse has been explored from its first freshness to more consumption, promises to see more innovation in the retail market.
"e.g. a business model that combines on-line and under-line, which attracts consumer eyes, and where fresh supermarkets are called and called. "
"These relationships are too much, they don't work, and finally you've brought a good experience to the consumer, so I'm willing to pay for it. "
According to the CEO Yuanbin, in the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed and the demand for purchases has changed.
Turns out the line was cut, the line was broken, the line was defeated, the line was counter-attacked, and now the consumer is holding hands together because there is no longer a line-up distinction.
Capital races have made the new retail gunpowder, which is now represented by the Fresh Supermarket.
The analysis found that new retail competition in first-line cities is still far from reaching the Red Sea and that there are large areas of second-line cities yet to be excavated and markets still have great opportunities and space.
Different types of trades bring new retail developments into a diversified state of development for new retailing.
In conjunction with the China Institute for Financial and Strategic Studies of the Chinese Institute of Social Affairs, the Finance and Economics channel has combed a dry product, the annual development report of Chinese electricity dealers in the country.
In the past year, what kind of report card did the Chinese electricity dealer make?
What are the global trends in electricity suppliers?
Let's do this for everyone.
Total sales are back on track at record speeds.
Starting in 2006, our online retail sales can be said to have been growing at a very high rate, and I think it was so cool to think that the Internet was so fresh that we could buy things without going out.
However, the growth in online retail sales began to fall below 50 per cent starting in 2013, with the first increase below 40 per cent in 2015 and 26.2 per cent in 2016.
But this year it's not the same, and online retail sales are accelerating again, rising to 34.2% in January-September this year.
Much higher than 2015, with growth rates in 2016.
Maybe you're going around, and you're going to find it more pleasant to buy.
Of this, the value of online retail sales of goods in kind is close to $5.08 trillion, and the value of online retail sales of services is close to $149 trillion.
The share of total retail sales of social goods reached 13.6 per cent, an increase of nearly 3 percentage points on the same date.
Class, don't snooze, focus. It's a big deal to sell online.
Second, French Internet users who love to chop their hands, who buy $1925 per capita, buy the most products on the Internet, clothing, and a country of fashion.

To help you avoid the company becoming the next best starter.
Amy Erett used to want to investigate staff happiness at her e-commerce start-up company, but the investigation didn't work.
The responses received are often vague, unhelpful and even worse, misleading.
Even though she promised anonymity, some employees still don't trust the process.
Errett is responsible for 75 people's San Francisco e-commerce companies, Madison Reed, who says, "The responses received lack consistency and objectivity."
That's why she called for help.
A new group of start-ups in human resources have emerged like rain, helping the company to understand how employees feel.
They build and empower software specifically designed to measure staff participation, thus allowing companies to conduct rapid public opinion polls targeting specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for employees and, in some cases, allow whistleblowers to report directly to the board of directors.
"Now, you can track your health by using tools such as Strava and Fitbit, but where's Fitbit at the company?" Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Clint, says.Glint software analysis tools are used by companies to measure staff professionalism.
Erett said that in three years, she used Glint to gain more insight into the ideas and feelings of her employees.
In addition to a team-specific quick survey and opinion poll, Glint also provides company hot maps, which offices have the most complaints, which managers have the lowest approval scores, and it's obvious that this allows her to get a deeper idea of why.
Companies are beginning to realize that they must be skilled in the company’s workplace culture in order to avoid becoming the next vantage point. A blog post describing the circumstances of harassment was published by pre-optimal employees who were punished by the company and then caught in a scandal.
For a start-up company like Glint, the company's desire for oversight is a money-rich business opportunity.
According to the Financial Technology Analysis website, the value of the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry could exceed US$ 118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a start-up firm in Denver, Colorado, was committed to helping companies prevent and detect bad behaviour, and they saw an increase in interest and activity during the loss of the reputation for valor earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Eppid, Microsoft and Tesla.
Yuzuki's recently signed into a client.
Like Glint, it allows the company to send customized "diagnosis" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view the hot maps of its problem areas.
Convercent also provides anonymous SMS hotlines for staff to report misconduct.
If the chairman is implicated, the complaint will go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent, says: "The Court of Opinion usurps the power of the regulatory authority.
If a company is found to be ill-addressed or immoral to its employees, it may face consumer resistance and the high consequences of staff loss and involvement in litigation even if the regulatory body does not intervene, Quinlan states.
Ruby Tuesday, a catering chain spanning more than 500 places and with over 25,000 employees, has been in use for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the work code and protocols and provide easy access to company headquarters.
Prior to that, if an employee wishes to report a problem, he or she must find a telephone number or e-mail at his or her head office and file a formal complaint, and hope that he or she will take it seriously.
This is often a frightening and disturbing experience, as the Attorney-General of Ruby Tuesday, James Witrano, said, did not think there was a good way to track employees' complaints.
But now, using Convercent, the company can more quickly identify and resolve problems that were previously unknown to a remote office, city or state administration - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage behaviour.
"I can get a full picture of my work experience closer, 360 degrees," says Vitrano, responsible for Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation. "
Quinlan indicated that companies began to pay more attention to ethics, values and staff professionalism in 2002 after the closure of the Andorran accounting firm due to an eccentric scandal.
But it wasn't until "social media went into their own world" that companies realized they couldn't stop their blasts from spreading virally online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people see hope as a strategy," he said.
Glint and Convercent both provide their software as services and charge companies recurrent fees for the use of their products.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by venture investors who have already supported these two start-ups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising its total capital to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million in funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, with a total of $60 million.
Given the interlinkage between corporate, cultural and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
More and more studies show that today's employees expect more jobs than ever before.
In a highly competitive market like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that they're accepted, valued, that their time is spent on a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company and feel that their voices are heard, the work they do is good, and they're more committed to making the company succeed." Nina McCartney, vice president of Global Welfare and Staff Experience, says LinkedIn, using both Convercent and Glint software.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio is performing well; companies are performing well in their employee loyalty and professionalism.
If third party analysis tools commit to increasing staff loyalty and professionalism, it's not surprising that they're looking for financial support.
Workplace culture experts argue that it is important to have data on staff professionalism.
But these data are useless unless the company's administrator takes action.
In fact, if a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be expected that the company is undergoing change.
If change is not moving fast enough, or if there is no progress at all, it could lead to disappointment and cause employees to leave the company.
"If you're looking for 4000 proposals, then you need to be ready for 4000 conversations."
'Cause if you don't follow through, the staff will think, 'Did you really hear what I said?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why do I care?"
Eret said that Madison Reed now conducts a monthly staff survey and can take action on the day that Glint reports the problem.
After collecting feedback from staff on their frustrations due to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to resolve the problem by reorganizing her internal team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insight into its employees, and in the long run they want to be able to change in this industry, known for its high brain drain rate, to better retain its staff.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you'll lose your talent," Vitrano said.
"If you lose your talent, you lose your client.
And when you lose your client, you lose your company. "

NCAAA cancels its training twice a day and extends the daytime training of the Bears.
It's close to 11:00 p.m., and the UCLA football team is wandering around the team's new campus practice.
Some of the players have taken off their sweatshirts and showed their sweat on the first day of the training camp.
For a large part of the team, a few minutes is a break.
After three hours of practice, the participants will return to the final exam in the dormitory, then to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"The next three days are a scuffle for these guys, and Coach Jim Mora of the Bears says on Monday is coming into Tuesday.
NCAAA cancelled its practice twice a day (in order to ease the burden on the players), but actually extended their daytime training - at least by Friday.
That's why the first three trainings at UCLA are scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to adjust to the crowd's schedule.
From the cancellation of training twice a day to more training once a day, the Bears started training almost a week before the last season, and Mora first trained at summer school in six seasons in Westwood.
They plan to start 18 trainings in August 20, then start preparing for the official race for the first Texas farmer in September.
Moira said he supported the NCAA regulation, although it would add another item to the team's busy schedule.
"In three or four days, we'll give them a huge amount of training, which is very challenging," Mora said.
"They've just passed. They're grinding. They're great kids.
I think we'll have more time on Saturday. It's really great. "
As soon as the training camp is over, the UCLA will stop training. Given the proximity of the parking lot and Luskin Center's clear-sighted view, this is not an easy task.
From the end of the week, the Bears will be staying at the hotel, but Mora admits that once these rooms are empty during the season, there may be problems.
"We'll take security measures," Mora said.
"It's a real concern to think that someone might rent a room and sit in a room and record the training scene, and that's not a big deal.
If you have a training tape, it's pretty good.
But we'll take security measures there, and we'll take security measures in parking lot 8.
We'll use the available resources to do the best we can.
I wouldn't worry too much about it.
We've made plans. "
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data show that in the second quarter of this year, the value of houses in Australia increased by an average of 1.5 to 2 per cent, an annual increase of 3.5 per cent, the lowest annual increase since March 2013.

IT House reported this morning that the Wall Street Journal reported that AT&T had cancelled plans to sell China's new flagship smartphones in the United States.
We planned to announce this partnership on CES this week, and AT&T cancelled it at the last minute.

It means that, over the past five years, it has demonstrated its strength by launching high-end products on the global and American markets.

Facebook will launch a fact-checking function to counter false news.
Facebook announced on Thursday that it would send more potential prank articles to third-party testing agencies and show the results under the original post. Facebook, the world's largest online social network, is trying to crack the so-called fake news.
Facebook stated in a statement on its website that Facebook would start using an updated machine to learn to detect possible pranks and send them to a fact-checker and possibly show the results of the fact-check under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main outlets of the so-called false news, and many people believe Facebook has influenced the 2016 presidential election.
This issue has also become a major political issue in Europe, with voters experiencing a proliferation of false stories before the May presidential elections in France, Germany taking the lead in adopting a plan to support fines, and a fine if social media networks fail to remove hate posts in time for the September elections.
Facebook stated in a separate statement in Germany on Thursday that a new fact-finding functional test was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing stories that are questioned by third-party fact-checkers, people want more background to help them make informed decisions about what to read and share."
She added that Facebook would continue to test its "associated articles" function and make other changes to its press summaries to reduce false news.
Create a drawing novel: The story of the Castle of England.
Recently, Little Scottie Castle became the leading actor in a compressed music film and once the refuge of Mrs Margaret Thatcher in the '70s.
But Scotney, who witnessed 700 years of turmoil in the comfort of the Baylor Valley in Kent, is now a source of inspiration for graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes (a Yorkshire who has a special interest in historical documents and has a moped head).
"I can see the handwriting of the ancient 300 years ago, and I find it so beautiful. "
"What kind of personality can make this letter fall into my hands. "
Across the Middle Ages and through Edward, a "Call of England" read books about families living in Scottney, each story being made by future British artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book by Rhodes that uses archives as a raw material: he also wrote "The Tooth and Other Story of the Dead in 2014, a book inspired by the British Library's literature, a work that he did with uncontrollable creative passion.
He said, "I can't contain my writing impulse from the moment I saw the thumb mark left on the side of the letter, written by a double agent working for Jacobs in the 18th century."
"That's his fingerprints!
And letters always smell like smoke, because then you need to light a fire to light up.
For us 300 years later, this smell makes us feel like they're with us.
Oh, I love the archives!"
For those moved by old paper, it seems wonderful to have the support of the National Trust and Arts Council of England and lived in the castle for almost four months, and I can't believe it.
Rhodes spent days visiting Victoria's "new" castle, looking at archives, studying many of the estate's treasures and ancient games, such as hyena heads hanging on walls and bottles that spent centuries in the moat.
He walks on the land and ruins of the old castle, chats with the homeless, gardeners, sometimes with the artist who draws illustrations for his book.
And then at night, he'll "drink whiskey and write."
Scotney's hidden history is not yet clear, because the British National Trust only entered fully after the death of Elizabeth Hershey, the last heir in 2006.
Ten years later, when Roz arrived, the staff started processing the files. He described them as "The nobles of centuries ago are leaving: "Oh, put them in the attic."
The diary, a letter from the time of the British Empire, depicts maps of national boundaries: "You'll find land disputes boring," said Rhodes, but there will be two families fighting for a white birch tree.
Let go, guys!"
Some of the stories in this work, starting with castles, went to a broader level to study the history of England, including The Labor, which was traced to a man who left the new castle to participate in the peasant uprising of 1381.
The story of the book called Knights of Kent and Sussex recorded a riot in the castle in 1380.
"The peasant uprising started in that area, and I think it's a good place to start.
Maybe there's a connection between these two?"
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit pastor for seven years during the British Reform.
Or the Smuggler, the story owned by an 18th century smuggler, Arthur Darrell, who was supposed to have his own funeral by filling his coffin with stones.

Yesterday, the well-known PFC Energy Company announced its top 50 rankings in 2011 in the United States oil and gas producer ExxonMobil with a market value of $406.3 billion, followed by China Oil and the Dutch Royal Shell.

In recent years, Google, Microsoft, Silicon Valley giants such as Amazon and Facebook have been engaged in an arms race in the field of artificial intelligence.
Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be careful.
At a time when you don't think it'll be weirder in 2017, a new technology development report has been published in the field of sex robots.
Yes.
Now it's a big deal about sex robots.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report looking forward to the next five to ten years of sex robots.
According to Noel Shaggy, Professor of Robot Technology and Artificial Intelligence Emeritus of the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking seriously the emergence of sex robots.
Customers can choose robot's eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
Shaggy said in his new report: "People laugh behind their backs, but corporations do have many sex robots, and we'll see more."
Modern sex dolls have evolved from gas-filled dolls into robots with silicon skins that feel warm and deliberately use artificial intelligence to create human-like sexual reactions.
Users can also " customize" their robots to satisfy their preferences, ranging from eye colours, nipple shapes to fingernails or colours.
But even more disturbingly, many robots with "personality" would make "reproducing wife" look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicon skin.
For example, RealBotix robots can come from definitions, such as shyness, depending on what the user thinks is attractive.
And the Roxxy Gold sex robot, developed by True Company, predestined character features, including the slightly shy "Cool Fara" and the "Wanty Wendy."
"Roxxy Gold Robots have personality that matches you as much as possible," True Company website.
That's why she loves you and hates you.
She was just like normal people in those days!
She can be lazy, she can talk, she can be "sexy"!"
The rise of sex robots has caused a lot of unease — not only replacing real human relationships — but also the femininity of bowing women and the hint of rape on the cold (read as resistance) of Farah is most worrying.
True Company compares Roxxy to a man's tremor on its website.
The website says, "If a woman has a vibrating stick, why can't a man have a Roxxy?"
But these sex robots aren't just lovers, and they're not just sex toys.
Their emergence and growing maturity point to the darker and deeper parts of our culture: fleeing from perfect gender equality to sex with submission as an additional option.
Of course, most men don't have sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more popular, they are still on the edge of consumer culture.
But something that infiltrates from the edges can show us the course of our time.
A lot of people aren't weird or aggressive until the free market gives them a chance to be like this.
It is no coincidence that these fine sex robots appear in an era in which women ' s rights are threatened globally, and that a president of the White House boasts about sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the show is not about making the scene real, it's not about the body hanging, it's not about the eyes being dug out, it's about the imagination that's too real.
The Republic of Gillion is a leap, but it doesn't look too far now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create the body of a true woman as technologically as possible (though in proportion to a porn star).
The creators of these robots want them to have the human touch and imitate the real human movement.
But, frankly, their personality doesn't mean real women.
They can't break up, they can't run away.
They have no recourse, no follow-up story, no independence, no possibility of breaking a complete vision of slavery.
In other words, they're fun slaves.
Or according to the popular language of 2017: "Associate woman."

Trump's great work?
Let Mitt Romney become a common sense microcosm.
Political differences bring about polarization among American voters and, from a micro-level, undermine American family harmony, which is no surprise to the Trump era.
Before and after Christmas and Thanksgiving, major newspapers in the United States were rife with the commentary column on how to cope with the fear of the Trump family.
Usually, we're doing our best to break our filter bubble.
Even less so is Trump's power to bring his family together.
I mentioned it because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, had a long history of disharmony with our Republicans, and he was visiting me this week in New York.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
As a result of working with Trump at the White House, all the people she knew, even relatives of Republicans who had been in political strife for decades, were suddenly and strangely on the same front.
It's certainly a good thing if we're all at the table, but I'm shocked that, from a broader perspective, it's a major risk.
Although the leftist has always been encouraged by Trump, the obtrusive effect of his presidency has driven us all to the right.
When we talk about normalization and Trump, we're talking about the possibility of fear that his weird behavior might stop someday.
However, there is a more worrying and long-term scenario in which Trump would like to "normalize" his relationship with the right-wing Republicans, who had previously opposed Mr. President's standards and now suddenly appear to be a symbol of reason.
I found myself recently having some thoughts about Mider Romney's madness: putting dogs on cars, 14% of income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), and the crimes of these two moves seem to be too minor compared to Trump.
After the Trump era, the next Republican candidate only needs to be sanely qualified to make incalculable improvements.
When my cousin lived in town, we took the kids to the carousel horse in New York Park, the biggest carousel in New York Central Park administration. If you don't need coffee, the $3 tickets are the most valuable in the city.
The sound of the wooden horse is as loud as thunder, the central cylinder is designed for fibreglass, all clowns and animals turn their heads around, and they look on their shoulders with horror and evil, while the twilight music rings strangely.
Too many mediocre cities are disappointing: from the landscape of high-rise buildings, the skyline becomes too familiar to provide too much stimulus, and the reality of cities does not sustain dreams.
Thirty-five years later, I haven't completely forgotten that day, and I found out that this "Swiss House" is not really a Swiss cabin, but an old Swiss cabin in the theme bar. I can't remember, but it's near a crossroads in northern London.
However, the merry-go-round horse in Central Park is still a magical experience, and everyone has fun for two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and four 40-year-old girls.
If I could judge the carousel, I'd give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before I brush my credit card, I was asked to score one to five stars for my business experience.
In my coffee shop in the corner of the street, it's the same thing, and it's the option to score 15 percent of the tips for shopping on the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down the supposed neutral transaction, but also to put pressure on the waiter to add the personal element to the situation that is not needed.
The poor woman in the department store was sorry to laugh, and I was tired and I gave her five stars in credit card trading experience.
Oscar Pistolis was transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain.
It's the second time Pistolis left prison for hospital.
Last year he was taken to the hospital to treat a wrist cut, which the prison official claimed was the result of his fall in the cell.

In the early morning hours of Valentine ' s Day in 2013, he shot Stinkamp several times at his home in Pretoria through the toilet door until he died.
Pistolis claims that she misconstrued her girlfriend as an intruder hiding in the middle of the night.
The prosecutor has announced their intention to appeal again, this time for six years against Pistolis, which they consider to be too generous.
The National Public Prosecutor ' s Office has indicated that an appeal will be filed with the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal will be heard this year.
If the prosecutor wins, Pistolis will face an increase to 15 years' imprisonment.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

On May 18, the Ministry of Finance announced the "Advanced Fund Management Scheme for Industrial Enterprise Restructuring", which will arrange special awards to facilitate the removal of coal, with excess capacity in the steel industry amounting to $100 billion.
Many local governments, such as Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang, have recently proposed reforms to address excess capacity.
Many of these provinces have even offered to actively seek financial support from the central fiscal authorities for their productive capacity.
In support of this, only eight provinces have declared coal production targets at 90% of the national coal reduction plan.
In an interview with a journalist, Limborg, Director of the China Energy Policy Research Institute at Xiamen University, argued that the iron and steel industry and coal industry's "de-productivity" depended on the central $100 billion alone was far from sufficient, and that more funding needed to be addressed by local governments and businesses.
The recently published implementing regulations for coal production in Shanxi Province provide for the reorganization of the Shanxi Coal Group into a State-owned capital investment company, the consolidation of the assets and operations of the enterprise and the construction of a new business model.

Does the meat, dairy products and chocolate help to alleviate inflammatory intestinal disease (IBD)?
The meat and chocolate may sound like your digestive system's nightmare.
But a new study shows the opposite: diets with meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms associated with inflammatory intestines.
The incurable disease has had a life impact on about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 British, causing stomach cramps and abdominal swelling, recurrent or haemorrhage, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at Washington University usually advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products in order to mitigate symptoms, but researchers find that key amino acid-cyanide in proteins can contribute to the growth of immune cells that increase the intestation of the intestinal tract.
Dr. Marco Colonna, Principal Researcher, explained that immune cells patrol the intestinal tract to ensure that harmful micro-organisms hidden in food do not sneak into the body.
To maintain a balance between the cells that cause inflammation and those that promote tolerance, and to protect the body from all kinds of sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
Inflammation can occur when the equilibrium is too biased towards inflammation.
An immunity-promoting cell was found in rats carrying specific bacteria.
Bacteria require chromosome amino acid (a component of protein) to form a cell's appearance.
Professor Coroner said, "We have established a link between a bacterial population and the development of a resistant cell population.
The more chromosomes the mice take in their diet, the more their immune cells.
He suggested that if humans used the same method, that is, a combination of Lactacia and a diet rich in chromosome amino acid, it might create a more resilient and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Luisa Cervantes-Baraganwas, a postdoctoral researcher, studied an immune cell that could increase resilience when she discovered that a group of rats had such cells, but not when the other group of the same strains were raised separately.
She suspects that this difference is related to the intestinal microorganisms of mice (the bacteria that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract, viruses and fungi).
DNA sequenced cholesterol in mice, and six bacterial populations were found in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
The mice are raised in a sterile environment, so they lack intestinal microorganisms and cannot produce this immune cell, and the presence of Lactium gives rise to immune cells.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers cultivate Lactium in liquids and then transfer small amounts of bacteria-free liquids to immunosynthetic cells separated from young rats.
The immune cell develops into a resilient cell.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be demonstrated that the active ingredient is a by-product of chromosome amino acid, known as thorium-3-emulsifiable acid.
The number of cells increased by about 50 per cent when researchers doubled the number of chromosome acids in mice feed, but when the level of chromosome acid was halved, the number of cells was halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people, like rats, have the same resistant cells and that most of us have Lactus in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether humans can induce cellular growth from Lactus by-products of chlamydia, as in experimental mice, but genetic defects associated with chlamydia have been detected among inflammated intestinal patients.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably what we want because they control the inflammation on the inside of the intestinal surface.
It can be said that the presence of high-level cyanide in Lactium may lead to an increase in its number.
José Murinio thinks we signed the Genius Nemania Matic.
On Wednesday night, after the first appearance of Nemania Matic in the Samptolia Contest, Murinio concluded that Mansion had signed a "genius" midfield player.
Martych came from Chelsea, with a contract of £40 million and won two to one on Tuesday in Dublin in the final run-up to the European Super Bowl in the Royal Madrid, winning the favor of Paul Bogba and Andreas Perera.
However, in the pre-Brucedy Asian Tour, the Mattics were severely understated and only 45 minutes had been completed, and Murinio admitted that it needed to be improved before the British Super season began.
"He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and genius in thinking -- he thinks about football, and Murinio says.
"We'll help him prepare as soon as possible."
Murinio started arranging his hair-sharp at the beginning of the season, and like Martych, the newly contracted players Victor Linderov and Romelu Lukaku started playing at the Injevar Stadium.
The independent newspaper reports this week that Mullinio still wants to bring in three more signed players, but he insists that the club "dos a great job" and that he has four top-choice guys in his heart, three of whom have been brought in.
"The club brought in three of the contracted players, and I appreciate it." He added.
"I'd be happier if the club could bring in all four players, but they've done a great deal for me. "
Will China fall behind if it doesn't build this ship?
With the recent announcement by the world ' s major naval powers of plans for the construction of new frigates, as if one night the frigates had become the focus of the attention of the naval forces of the great Powers, first of all, when Japan decided to procure two new frigates in its 2018 defence budget, which led to a substantial breakthrough in Japan ' s frigate plan, and then when the United States of America, Lockheed Martin, recently announced the latest programme of the FFG frigate programme, where is China ' s new frigate?
With the discharge of one of the latest 054A frigates at the end of 2017, marking the construction of up to 29 frigates, nearing the sum of the 053H series of frigates, the construction of 054A has been under way for 12 years since the first 054A in 2006, and even worldwide, the construction of such a large number of high-performance common frigates, except for China, where only the United States of America, built in the 1970s and 1980s, has been able to compare them.
And the reason why so many 054As are built is simple, that's real money, good use, plus the Navy's debts over the years.
The 054A frigate, which has been favoured by the Chinese Navy for many years with a high value of value and good combat power, has a discharge capacity of about 4,000 tons, carries a 76-mm main gun, 32 units of sea red flag-16 and fish-8 anti-submarine anti-submarine missile co-launched hair-trigger system, eight eagles hit 83 and a direct-9 helicopter, although it was built in 2006 and was designed earlier, but its combat power, even today, is not too poor, and it can reach the upper-middle level among the world ' s frigates.
But this is, after all, a ship designed at the beginning of the twenty-first century, equipped with weapons on one side, with power systems and electronic radar equipment that are already very different from the current mainstream frigates in the world, such as the same frigates in Europe, which are equipped with full electric propulsion, small multifunctional radars, large helicopter decks, and it is time to develop new models.
So how China's new frigate should develop is directly related to its future location and the strategic direction of our Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will surely be a blue-water navy, and the future will be a sea of great interest for the rapid deployment of areas of vital interest to China, demonstrating the presence of force and, if necessary, strong combat power to ensure that China ' s vital interests in the region are not undermined. It would therefore appear that the new Hu Wei River will be made larger and more oceanic.
If we look at the location of the new frigate in the future sequence of the Chinese Navy, the future Chinese Navy will be similar to the United States Navy, and other major naval vessels will form carrier battle groups or amphibious attack fleets, as required.
The role of the new frigate should serve as a location for anti-submarine backbone and mid-to-centenary in the future carrier battle group, and as a frigate in the amphibious attack fleet, so that the new frigate must have strong anti-subsperial and good mid-range capability.
Based on the above positioning, a bold idea of the future of the frigate could be drawn.
First, there would be a significant increase in discharge relative to the current 054A frigate, with an estimated discharge volume of 5,000-6,000 tons from the new frigate; the power system would use an integrated power propulsion system consisting of an improved QC280 gas turbine and two diesel engines, with a maximum speed of about 30 knots and a significant increase in retention capacity; the hangar and shutdown platforms would also be increased to bring down and store two 10-ton-class helicopters, but a red flag 10 launch system would be added, and the main cannon would have a 32-48 unit with an improved red flag 16 and a fish-8 co-conservation system behind it, with a large fall-off system of 8-16 in the back of the vessel, which would be used for launching eagles 18 and new cruise missiles; the hangar and shutdown platforms would also be increased to reach the parking and storage of two 10-ton-size helicopters; and, in the case of the electronic radar system, a small fixed four-face control radar, based on 346A, could be equipped with a low-assembrear similar to the European liner.
So that the overall level of the new frigate will reach the world's highest standards, even if it's not as good as the FFG of the United States.
Of course, the concept mentioned above is merely an assumption of the new frigate of national production, specifically how we can only find out when the new frigate is underwater, so let's all look forward to it.

In recent times, there have been discussions about recent changes in real estate policy, whether real estate policy is being unbridled again. Will the diversification of land policy providers lead to a decline in housing prices?
But when we were worried about real estate prices, about macroeconomic regulation, and about future developments in the real estate market, the People's Daily wrote again. Last time we devoted our comments to the regulation of real estate, the People's Daily paper now deals with a more serious topic than buying a house, which is whether you can afford a house, even if you can afford it.
Today, let's talk about a bigger problem than buying a house: repayment.
First, the growing housing debt crisis in China
According to data from the People's Daily overseas edition, published on 17 January, "The Awards and Loans: The Joys and Concerns of Young People Fighting", in November 2017, the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the China Social Science School, the “Three Quarterly Report of China's Deleveraging Process”, published by the National Balance Sheet Research Centre, noted that the population sector's leverage rate continued to rise, rising by 1.3 percentage points, from 47.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6 per cent in the third quarter, and by 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The share of debt in the residential sector in the overall real economy has increased, and the leverage rate has risen faster.
Studies show that Chinese households ' liabilities in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, which account for about two thirds of the population ' s liabilities, approximately twice as much as their operating loans.
Of these, about 80 per cent of medium- and long-term loans, dominated by housing loans, are consumer loans, but in terms of growth, short-term consumer loans are growing faster than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition, China ' s household debt rate merely accounts for the total amount of credit that the family sector has received from financial institutions, while Chinese households also have large amounts of private loans, including loans to relatives and friends, and large-scale hidden debt.
The data show that China ' s population leveraged only 3 per cent in 1996 and 18 per cent in 2008, but since 2008 it has been growing rapidly, doubling in just six years, reaching 36.4 per cent. By the third quarter of 2017, the population leveraged as high as 48.6 per cent.
Let's compare the data again. In May last year, HSBC released a survey report across nine countries, with close to 10,000 respondents.
The report was visited by the Millennium Generation of Young People in nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
According to the report, China ' s 80-90 housing ownership rate for young people is as high as 70 per cent, leading to a second Mexico (46 per cent) and twice the United States target (35 per cent).
The data tell us that one of the most likely problems is that China's largest potential "grey rhinoceros" at this stage is probably unaffordable compared to being unable to afford a house.
Secondly, why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have previously analysed, although we have always said that housing prices are higher in China, the housing ownership rate in China is quite high compared to other countries in the world.
We look at the world's real estate markets, China's real estate markets have not experienced a major real estate crisis, except for what we said earlier about Hainan, but just 10 years ago, the financial tsunami of 2008 in the world began with the real estate crisis in the United States.
The reason for the real estate crisis in the United States is attributed to two houses: the real estate and the real estate.
In the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold their houses to low-income people in the United States in an effort to expand sales at a very low down payment level, and at a time when the United States economy was better, the real estate market was also booming, but not long ago, as the United States economy stagnated, causing the income of home buyers to fall, and so large household consumption expenditures began to fall.
However, the current situation in the United States was an integral part of the financial and real estate assets of United States household assets, almost all of which were real estate in the low-income groups of the United States, while most of the assets in the top 20 per cent of the high-income groups were financial assets, and the higher the debt ratios of the poorer households in the United States.
It is a serious fact that these people buy houses at a better time of economy, so the money to pay the mortgages is also calculated in terms of their better income, and that when income falls, the pressure on the mortgages not only does not diminish, but even because some subprime lending schemes have become more volatile, so that the real estate problems of these American families have gradually evolved into a real estate crisis.
Thus, some people who cannot afford to pay their mortgages because their income is too low to recover their property, and when banks recover their property from their defaulters, they sell it at very low prices, leading to a gradual decline in housing prices in the region, which in turn has led to a vicious circle in which, after falling to a certain extent, more and more buyers find their house worth even lower than their own loans, so that more people stop paying their mortgages and generate more bad debts.
Thus, a huge vicious circle emerges:
"The economic downturn — the decline in income — some people can't afford mortgages — banks sell unaffordable houses at low prices — house prices fall — more people stop paying their mortgages — banks sell again — house prices fall ..."
And that's more than the problem, because you don't have a debt after people stop paying the bank for the house, and if the money you owe to the bank for the sale of the house is still outstanding, then you need to pay it back, just to put it simply, assuming you bought a three-million-dollar house with the first $600,000 and the $2.4 million loan, and when the house falls to only $2 million, you don't repay the house to the bank, and after the bank auctions the house, you lose $600,000, and you owe the bank 400,000.
So, in such a vicious circle, the US economy collapsed, eventually triggering the US financial crisis of 2008.
Thus, the high level of household debt at this stage, at 46.8 per cent, is a matter of great vigilance, which is still below the level of developed countries, but the problem has begun to emerge, and the country has repeatedly emphasized deleveraging since last year, which is a very priori judgement that family debt ratios, if allowed to continue rising, will entail a huge risk, so that financial risks are prevented.
So the house was then used for housing, not for disinformation, and the State speeded up the establishment of multi-subject supplies, multi-channel guarantees, rental acquisitions and so on, to further mitigate potential risks.
For our individual families, it is important to abandon the speculation of real estate, to do everything in their power to buy a house, to avoid the burden placed on their own families, and only a reasonable assessment of their income and debt levels is a healthy path to family wealth development.

The British inventor implants a chip in his own body and waves his hand into the house.
An English inventor installs a chip for himself, he just waves his hand to open his front door, enters the office and even starts the car, becoming the first person in the country.
33-year-old Steven Northam implanted a small chip between his thumb and his finger, and is now providing this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, which is done by his company BioTeq through technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Jeff Watson, senior adviser at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Hampshire, to ensure that the implantation process meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to cat and dog chip implants, and it only takes 30 seconds.
Mr. Northham's company will also replace the locks of the rooms and vehicles in order to be compatible with the chip, at a cost of £300 per lock.

There was a great deal of excitement about this central financial workshop, which focused both on national development and on personal life.
On 10 July, the National Statistical Office published the National Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Industrial Producers ' Plant Price Index (PPI) for June 2016.
The White House props cost thousands of dollars.
According to the military records published in Time magazine, last month the White House decided to transport a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the great glory of American manufacturing at a cost of $24,000.
In a green and white light, Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine 1 when the President was travelling, was an important exhibit on the US construction project on July 17th.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Burns and senior White House officials have visited manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibit consisted of a Connecticut-made helicopter, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House Military Office has requested the helicopter to appear on a daily order (FRAGO), that is, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "special" event.
The day before the event, Commander HMX-1 in an e-mail sent to the Commander-in-Chief of the High Marines Flight said, "I just want to make sure that you know that because this event is highly valued."
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive on the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17th for an afternoon event at 3 p.m. and leave after clearing the lawn at 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on the same night.
The information also indicates that, in the event of a delay in departure from the White House, a second crew would be required to return due to the time limit on duty.
The original crew is on standby alongside the helicopter during the course of the operation, while the security forces are on standby nearby while the aircraft is on the ground.
The record in Times doesn't clearly indicate whether a second crew is ultimately needed.
The Hutch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record indicates that HMX-1 asked whether this event was in violation of the Act.
The commander wrote, "The question we ask is whether this is a violation of the Hutch Act and was told there was no violation."
"It sounds like you're locked up." Deputy Commander replied.
The White House has defined this American manufacturing activity as an official activity and is therefore not subject to the Hutch Act.
But even official events are political.
At the event, the President pursued the issue of the then Senate: medical reform and brazenly praised the control of government regulations.
The use of Marines I or Air Force I for political propaganda purposes is no longer new.
Successive presidents have been asked to travel on these planes.
But it's not common for them to be requisitioned just for taking pictures.
Trump received attention in February, when the president's jet slipped through Melbourne, Florida, and ended up in the background of his first campaign rally, and his Twitter account was filled with complaints about the use of the president's machine by the former president.
Lindsay Walters, White House deputy news spokesman, said, "The White House was so excited about this "American-made" exhibition, which showed products from all 50 states that were made by American workers using American materials."
HMX-1 crew members regularly conduct flight training near Washington and on the South Lawn to practice the accurate placement of the President of the United States in the White House.
In early July, during Trump's G-20 Summit in Germany, HMX-1 practiced 58 landings at the White House.
According to one official, this U.S. manufacturing flight was included in this month ' s crew training requirements.
The helicopter unit also flew an extra 11 hours of "non-presidential support mission" that day.
The White House says the taxpayers didn't pay for any of the other props of the event.
Sikorsky's spokesman said the company was not involved in arranging a South Lawn helicopter show.
HMX-1 does not maintain budgetary records of the Presidential flight, and it is therefore very difficult to determine the exact cost of this event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence ' s hourly costs for the 2017 fiscal year, the reimbursable costs of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D are US$ 24,380 per flight hour.
Force records recorded 30 minutes of each flight from a base at Quantico Marine Airport, Virginia.
The White House claims that the cost of operating the helicopter is much lower than the cost.
Walters claims that "an estimate of taxpayers' fees based on reimbursable fees is misleading.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other costs that are sunk in the annual appropriation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the reimbursable costs of the Ministry of Defence did not include personnel costs, but did include oil, maintenance and contracting costs.
At that time, a former White House news spokesman, Sean Speicher, used the helicopter to defend the event.
"The idea is to show this week what the United States makes,
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are both proud of this, and that they have all contributed to our national security, and I guess hundreds of people work on it without thousands.
And I think, like most Americans, we're proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the result of countless American efforts.
So it's certainly not out of date to show that. "
We don't know if Trump interacted with the helicopter during a tour of the South Lawn during his activities, but he did take the driver's seat in the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to the representative of Sikorsky, making jokes about his own company's aircraft and the media.
He said, "I know the Sikorsky plane. I have three."

13 developers vying for the price of the redized plant plot in the Tian River region or going to break $10,000/m2
Reporter Zhao Yinhua reported that no fewer than 13 developers will be fighting this afternoon for the reinforcement of the Red Chemical Plant plot, which is today being used for category II housing (R2) on Yellow River Avenue in Tianxi, with a surface area of 17304 square metres (15178 square metres of buildingable land) and a building area of 45534 square metres.
The plots contain small and medium-size housing requirements, with housing areas below 90 square metres accounting for no less than 60 per cent of the total area of residential development.
Based on the maximum size of a small or medium household, the plot will provide at least 303 small or medium-sized housing units.
The plot is known to be on the east side of Yellow Poon, across the road to the Tian River Building Design Institute, and the perimeter is well equipped for the first block of the Tian River area to be hung up this year.
In addition, the White Cloud Zone will be given a second-class housing area (R2) on the North Road with the East Python Pyramid, covering an area of 32891 m2 (30,965 m2) of building space, 92,895 m2 of building space, $6,311.1 million starting point and $6,600 m2/m2.
The plot is the first home in the White Cloud area to be launched this year, with a similar requirement of 30 per cent for small and medium-sized suites (under 90 square metres).
The three-line extension of the subway runs from the west, and the plot is located between the station and the south hospital station in Kyoto Creek.

According to the Market Star, from 2005 to 2011, I saved my GDP from the central side to the bottom.
But my provincial economic growth continues to suffer from low investment efficiency and the lack of core competitiveness of the industrial economy.
Based on some representative indicators of our provincial economy in 2005 and 2011, it is compared to the national and central regions.
In terms of industrial economic efficiency, in 2011, the energy-intensive industries, such as raw materials, which occupied a significant share of industrial energy in my province, were subject to high market volatility and excess capacity "double pressure", while the leading industries, such as domestic electricity and automobiles, were under-inventive, leading to low profits.
And the fact that large investments have not produced the corresponding economic benefits is an important reason for the poor quality and efficiency of our economic growth.
In this regard, the experts recommended that effective measures be taken to encourage innovation in enterprises and that scientific and technological achievements in higher schools and research institutes be "transferred" to enterprises in a timely manner.
With regard to the low efficiency of the industrial economy, experts said that there was also a need to actively promote industrial mergers and restructuring, optimize industrial layout and extend industrial chains.

Pladis, the owner of McVitat, says that over the past few years, the company has invested more than £5 million in the plant.
He added that if there was a change in the operation of the plant, the employees and union representatives would be the first to know.
In a letter addressed to the director of the company, the British General Union Scotland called on McVitat to "solve the issue of the non-transfer of funds to the modernization of the production line."
"We can't get a clear idea from the factory manager about the future business needs and investment plans of Tollcross, which are a source of deep concern to our members.
Generations of families working here and the high concentration of labour in the local community and Grand Glasgow are important pillars of decent employment in areas with high levels of unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, from the perspective of employment, pay and economic prosperity, the Eastern Glasgow region urgently needs the ever-expanding Mvita production network in the context of the rising cost of living and the prolonged decline in manufacturing in the United Kingdom ... "
According to the spokesperson for Pradis: "The director of Tollcross just yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of the United Kingdom General Trade Union, which will respond immediately because we attach importance to maintaining continuous contact with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and representatives of the United Kingdom Federation of Trade Unions in Tollcross to discuss a number of issues openly.
We had discussions with our employees, and then, like all other companies operating in an environment of intense competition and economic uncertainty, we reviewed the continuing business model that we applied to enterprises and factories in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We are fully aware of the historic status of Tollcross as a production base, and if there is any change in our operations at the plant, employees and union representatives will be the first to know ... "

On May 10th, environmental volunteers loaded the classified waste into the truck.
Over the last decade or so, Chinese news agency journalists have seen the environmental problems of mountain peaks becoming more acute as the number of expeditions and tourists on Everest has increased dramatically.
In the spring of 1997, the Tibetan Autonomous Region Mountain Climbing Association launched its first clean-up campaign on the north slope of Everest, cleaning up a collection of living waste such as the oxygen bottles left over from the 1960s and 1970s. The video was also broadcast at the Tokyo World Climate Conference and attracted world attention.

Three years ago, in Paris, St. Germain warned Barcelona to sign Nemar?
Nica might regret throwing an olive branch at Marco Valetti.
After an offer of £189 million had been made to allow it to exercise the immunity clause, would St. Germain, Paris, not have given up his signature to Némar, but had they warned Barcelona three years earlier that it would launch an attack against the world record raider?
This sensational approach has opened the window for the summer round, and the Al-Father Club is about to break the world round record at more than twice the last round. Paul Bogba returned to Mansion in the last season, amounting to £89 million.
Once the transition is complete, Nell will jump to the highest bidder in the world and the highest paid professional player in the world - St. Germain, Paris, provides post-tax pay of over £5 million a week.
Barcelona was outraged by the way Nemal attacked and the way out, and sources on the Catalan Board of Directors insisted that after his arrival from Santos in 2013, the club did everything possible to take care of him.
But did President St. Germain of Paris make such predictions about football three years ago?
When Man City expressed interest in signing Bryce Matedi in 2014, Nassir Al-Hlefi gave a harsh warning to any club that wanted to sign the best player in St. Germain, Paris.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they touch any of our players, we'll be against them, and we'll be in touch with their players." Alhraf says.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign on to our players, they'll have to eat their own. "
Earlier this summer, the Spanish club seemed to have crossed the line and Barcelona threw an olive branch at Marco Valetti, a midfield player in St. Germain, Paris.
St. Germain, Paris, made it clear that they would never allow the Italian foot to leave, and Barcelona would probably be affected by the loss of the genius Nemar.
