The first economic reform was led by Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China has grown 90 times more economically.
Last year, China exported more cars than Germany for the first time and went beyond the United States to become the largest market in the car industry.
China’s GDP may exceed the US in 20 years.
Hot belt storm Danielle formed east of the Atlantic Ocean, and Danielle was the fourth named hurricane in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season.
The storm is about 3000 miles from Miami, Florida, with a maximum sustained wind speed of 40 miles per hour (64 kilometres per hour).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will be strengthened as a hurricane on or before Wednesday.
The storm is still a while away from landing, and it is still difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.

"The lucky thing is I didn't do anything, but I saw a terrible scene where people tried to break the window and escape.
People hit the windows with chairs, but the windows are unbreakable.
The survivor Francesek Koval said, "One of the glass finally broke and they started to escape from the window."
Stars produce light and heat because they generate energy when hydrogen atoms merge together to form heavier elements.
Scientists are working to create reactors that can generate energy in the same way.
However, this problem is very difficult to solve, and it will take years to build a useful reactor.
The needle floats on the surface because of surface tension.
Surface tension occurs from the attraction of water molecules, more than between them and air molecules above.
Water molecules form an invisible layer of surfaces on the surface of the water so that needles and other things can float on the surface.
The blades of modern skates have two blades and there's a pit between the blades.
Because the blade's bottom is slightly bent, and when the blade is tilted to one side, the edge of the blade is bending over the ice.
If the skaters turn right, the skaters turn right, and if the skaters turn left, the skaters turn left.
To return to the original level of energy, the atom must remove the extra energy from the light.
They do it by emitting microscopic particles known as the Pyrophotes.
Scientists refer to the process as "extreme radiation" because atoms are irritated by strong light, leading to the photon in the emission light, which is a kind of radiation.
The next picture shows atoms emitting light. Of course, in reality, the photo is much smaller than what it sees in this picture.
The photon is even smaller than the substance that makes it an atom!
After hundreds of hours, the light in the light bulbs will eventually burn, making the light bulb no longer usable.
And then the light bulbs need to be changed.
First of all, you need to turn off the lights or cut the wire.
This is because if you touch the inside of the plug or the bottom of part of the light bulb still touches the plug, the current into the plug (i.e., the location of the light bulb metal part) can cause you severe electrical shocks.
The main organ of the loop system is the heart that pumpes blood.
The blood flowes from the heart to the pipe known as an artery and from the pipe known as a vein to the heart.
Triangular dinosaurs can crush not only the leaves, but even very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists think Triceratops feed on iron, a plant that is common in the white age.
These plants look like a little palm tree with a sharp puncture.
Triceratops may have taken their leaves off with their strong beaks before eating the trees.
Other scientists reject that these plants are highly toxic, so no dinosaur is likely to eat, yet other animals, such as today ' s lazy and pelicans, can eat toxic leaves or fruits.
How will the Earth's core pull me? If you stand on the surface of the Earth's surface, you'll weigh less than the surface of the Earth.
A man weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth, 36 pounds (16 kg) on Woodguard.
The sun doesn't have the Earth's crust that allows you to stand on it.
The further away from the center of the sun, the thinner the gas.
What we see in the sun is called a light layer.
About 3,000 years later, Italian astronomer Galileo Gallie used telescopes to observe Venus as a moon in 1610.
Venus (or the moon) is only lighted on the sun, so there are winners and losers.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, the British astronomer Jeremiah Horox observed Venus Day.
England went through a long period of peace after taking Denmark again.
However, in 991 Esselrad met the largest Viking fleet since the last century of the Gutrum fleet.

Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language that is the source of many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the source of European languages such as French and Spanish.
With the end of the war with France, Germany began preparations to invade the island of Britain.
The British lost most of their heavy weapons and supplies at Duncock's retreat, and the army was weak.
But the Royal Navy is still much stronger than the German Navy and can destroy any invading fleet crossing the English Channel.
However, as the Admiral is concerned that the ships will be sunk by German air attacks, very few Royal Navy ships will survive near the larger invasion route.
Let's start by explaining Italy's plans.
Even if they had just built four new ships before the war began, it still had weaker armies and naval forces.
The main objective of Italy is African countries, and in order to take over these countries, they will need a place for their troops to go so that they can cross the Mediterranean Sea to invade Africa.
They need to be removed from their British bases and ships in Egypt.
Now speaking of Japan, Japan is an island like England.
The submarine is a ship that sails underwater and stays for a long time.
The submarines were used during World War I and World War II. They were very slow and had very limited range.
In the early days of the war, most of them sailed at sea, but as the radar developed, it became more precise, forcing submarines to sail underwater to avoid detection.
German submarines are called U-boats.
Since they're very successful with submarines, Germany can have many submarines without trust after the war.
Yes! King Tutankhammen is sometimes called "King Tut" or "King of Boys", one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings of the modern age.
Interestingly, he wasn't valued in ancient times, and most ancient kings don't have his memoirs on their lists.

Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, most famous of all his theory of the trigonometric relationship.
Indian is estimated to be the second to fourth most used language in the world.
The number of people whose native language is Hindi varies depending on whether the very close dialects are counted.
It's estimated that between 340 million and 500 million people in language use understand the language, and 800 million more people understand it.
In daily conversations, users of both languages usually understand each other.
In the 15th century or so, Northern Estonia was highly influenced by German culture.
Some German monks, in bringing God closer to the local people, invented the written language of the Estonian language.
It's taken from the German alphabet and added a character called "Photo/O".
With the passage of time, many of the words borrowed from Germany have been integrated.

Turkey is surrounded by three sides: the Aegean Sea in the west, the Black Sea in the north and the Mediterranean in the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence dates back to 1839.
Some of today's Belgian soil was part of Luxembourg in the past, but it became part of the Belgian revolution in the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always tried to maintain its neutral role, but it was occupied by Germany during the First World War and the Second World War.
Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization in 1957, known today as the European Union.
Chukgyzenberg is an abandoned fort and Buddhist temple in the upper part of Phondey Village.
Zabron Awan Namgair built this fortress in 1649 in memory of his defeat of the Tibetan Mongols.
In 1951, only part of the legacy of a fire that led to Jokgyzenberg could be preserved, one of which was one of the drawings of Zabron Awan Namgair.
Fortressed and protected after the fire became one of the most attractive sites in Bhutan.
During the 18th century, Cambodia found itself between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.

Learn about creative and interactive media skills for regularity and tradition, and tools acquired in interactive classes (panel, audio and video editors, storytelling, etc.)
The interactive design requires you to re-evaluate assumptions about media production and learn to think in a non-linear way.
The interactive design requires that the components of the project be connected to each other, but at the same time it becomes a unique entity.
To reach a certain focal length, the missing point of the focal lens is that the complexity of the focus and the number of elements of the lens are more demanding.
It's not a problem, because the producers of the lens have been able to produce a higher-quality lens.
It allows the focal lens to take pictures of quality comparable to the focal lens.
The other flaw in the focal lens is that the largest halo (speed) in the mirror is usually lower.
It's making the cheap focal lens difficult to use in a low-light environment without a flashlight.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a film into a DVD format is overscanting.
Most TV shows are designed to please the public.
So, all the shows you saw on TV, tops, bottoms and sides were cut off.
It's to make sure the image covers the entire screen.
Unfortunately, when you make DVDs, it's likely that its boundaries will be cut off, and if the subtitles of the film are too close to the bottom, they won't be shown in their entirety.
The traditional castles of the Middle Ages have always inspired imagination, fought and the feast and the sight of King Arthur's knights were in sight.
Even standing in the ruins of a thousand years of history, the likeness still smells of war, hears the sound of horses on the pebbles and feels fear in the dungeons.
But our imagination is only based on reality. Why are castles created at first? How are they designed and built?
The classics of the time, Kirby was actually more like a solid house than a real castle.
Its large windows and thin walls cannot withstand the sustained attacks.
In the 1480s, the castle was built by Lord Hastings, when the country was more peaceful in relative terms and only to defend against the bandits of the vagrancy.
Maintaining the balance of power is a system in which European countries seek to safeguard the sovereignty of all European countries.
The idea is that in all European countries there must be a way to prevent one of these countries from becoming stronger, so governments often switch allies to maintain balance.
The Spanish throne was crowned with the first war of power balance.
This sign represents a major shift, because the European powers can no longer justify religion as an excuse for war. 30 years of war have been called the last religious war.
On July 20, 356 B.C., in the Atimis temple of Ephesus, Herostadts admitted that he had set fire to him.
According to his words, his motive was to get a reputation even if he did anything.
Fortunately, Greek historian Strapo wrote his name, so we only learned today that this temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander the Great offered to pay for the reconstruction of the temple, which was later rebuilt in 323 B.C. after Alexander died.
Make sure your hands are as relaxed as possible, and at the same time you strike all the notes correctly - and try not to move your fingers too much.

To increase the volume of the accordion, you can put more pressure or speed in the trunk.
Mystics seek the ultimate truth, the gods, the truth or communication with God, and seek recognition and self-consciousness.
Those who believe in it seek direct experience, intuition or insight in the divine reality/god.
Followers pursue certain ways of life or practices designed to nurture them.
Mysticism, unlike other forms of religious belief and worship, emphasizes the direct personal experience of sui generis forms of consciousness, especially for those who have peace, insight, happiness and even joy.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the Punjab region of the fifteenth century, divided from Hindu sects.

The Indus Valley civilization is a bronze-era civilization in the north-west of the sub-continent of India, encompassing most of the modern Pakistan and some parts of north-west India and north-east Afghanistan.
The civilization flourished in the Indo River Basin and came up with this name.
Although some scholars assume that this civilization also exists in the now dried-up Zarasvati river basin, it should be known as the Insa II civilization, while others named it Halapa (where it was first found in the 1920s) as Harapa civilization.
The militarism of the Roman Empire is, by its very nature, helping medical progress.
Augustus began recruiting doctors and even set up the first Roman medical team to treat the wounds caused by the war.
Surgeons have knowledge of sedatives, such as morphine in seed extracts and the epidural seed.
They're proficient in amputations, rescue patients from gangrene, and use tourniquets and arteries to stop the flow of blood.
For centuries, the Roman Empire has brought tremendous gains in the field of medicine and shaped much of what we know today.
Clean paper is limited to a single piece of paper stream, which is not allowed to use more complex methods such as introvertation, and each stack has an easily understandable stacking position.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help people with less paper experience or limited mobility.
When children were very young, they had developed racial and racial stereotypes that affected their behavior.
For example, when children know that their minority ethnic group is mostly under-characterized at school, their performance at school tends to be worse.
MySpace is the third most popular site in the United States, with 54 million users.
These sites attract much attention, especially in terms of education.
These sites have many positive implications, including the ease with which school pages can be created, which may include blogs, videos, photographs and other functions.
It's easy to visit pages with one URL, and it's easier to remember and type for students who are not good at keyboarding and spelling.
It can be customised, make it easier to read, and add or reduce colours as needed.
Focusing deficiency is a neurosystemic syndrome, typically characterized by three symptoms, including impulsiveness, distraction and excess or over-exploitation."
It's not a learning disorder, it's a learning failure; it's "an impact on three to five percent of children, that is, two million more American children".
Children with under-intensity can hardly concentrate on something, such as schoolwork, but they can concentrate on something they love, such as playing games, watching the favorite cartoons or writing sentences without labels.
These kids get in trouble because they use "dangerous behavior, fighting and challenging power" to stimulate the brain, because it can't get it in a normal way.
Focusing deficiency affects relationships with other peers, because other children cannot understand why patients behave and cause trouble, or why they have different levels of maturity.
The ability to learn and learn has changed in the manner mentioned above, and the efficiency of acquiring knowledge has changed.
The pressure does not exist in personal memory, the focus becomes the ability to remember words.
The Renaissance of Arts has changed the way in which learning and knowledge are disseminated.
The originals are different from other primates, who no longer move with their hands, carry weight or shake between trees.
The size and length of the chimpanzee's palms and toes are similar, reflecting the heavy use of the hand in the direction of walking.
Human hands are smaller than feet, and their fingers are sharper.
Two million to three million years ago, hand bones revealed a shift in hands from moving to operating.
Some believe that it's very exhausting to experience these people's sober dreams.
The main reason for this is that awake dreams prolong the time between rapid eye sleep.
The less time you sleep fast every night, the less time you get real sleep and physical recovery, the less trouble you get.
It's like waking up watching TV every 20 or 30 minutes.
These effects depend on the frequency of your brain trying to wake up every night.
The situation of Italians in North Africa has been difficult almost since the beginning.In June 10, 1940, a week after the Italian declaration of war, British 11th Light Riders took over Fort Capuzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured General Ratucci, the 10th Italian general engineer.
On June 28, apparently the successor of Mussolini, Governor of Liberia, Italo Barbo, was killed by fire from his friends in Tobruk.
There are many different degrees in this modern sports campaign, ranging from students studying in universities to professional swordfighters in Olympics.
This sports campaign is conducted mainly in a two-person mode, with a swordfighter against another swordfighter.
Golf is a game where golfers use golf clubs to hit a hole.
There are 18 holes in the standard round, and the players usually start at the first hole in the field and end at the end of the eighteenth hole.
The player who finishes all the holes in the field with a minimum number of poles or swings wins.
The movement takes place on the grass, and the grass around the hole is cut short and called fruit.
The most common form of travel may be the knowledge of most people about travel: leisure travel.
People go to places that are very different from their daily lives and relax and enjoy themselves.
The beach, the theme park and camping are the most frequent places for tourists.
If the purpose of someone visiting a place is to understand the history and culture of the place, it is called cultural travel.
Travellers can visit different landmarks in a country, or choose to visit one of the regions with a focus on it.
The colonizers saw these events and called for reinforcements.
The army reinforced the deployment of the front-line positions, including Colonel John Stark and Colonel James Reed, the first and third legions of New Hampshire, with a total of 200 soldiers.
Stark's soldiers took the north end of the colony along the fence.
When the tide retreats at a crack along the Mystery River in the north-east of the peninsula, they quickly extend the wall of small stones to the north, and then reach the water side of the beach.
Greeley or Stark placed a stake about 100 feet in front of the fence and ordered that no one be allowed to fire until the regulars passed.
The U.S. plans to launch a coordinated attack in three different directions.
General John Cadewald struck the British garrison in Borden town to the west in order to block any reinforcements.
General James Ewing led 700 militiamen across the river at the Trenton dock, took over the bridge on Assomlink Creek and prevented any enemy from escaping.
The 2,400 main assault squad will cross the 9-mile river north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one following Green and the other following Sullivan, in order to launch the pre-morning offensive.
When you run from four to one mile to a half mile, the speed is less important, and patience becomes absolutely necessary.
The first half-mile runners who can hit the line in two minutes must maintain a reasonable speed, but also have the patience to respond to all the crises.
Some run across the winter and tie up the upper half of the gym is the best preparation for the run season.
The right dietary absorption alone does not produce good performance, but it effectively improves the overall health of young athletes.
Keeping a healthy energy balance, developing effective water rehabilitation practices and understanding the various aspects of training can help athletes improve their performance and make sport more enjoyable.
Midway running is a relatively cheap sport; however, there is still a lot of misunderstanding about the number of devices needed to participate.
Products can be purchased on demand, but in most cases they have only minor or no real impact on performance.
Activists may turn to something, even if it does not bring any practical benefit.
Atoms are considered to be one of the building blocks of everything.
According to the simplified Boer model, it is a very complex entity, surrounded by electrons and similar to planets orbiting the sun.
The atomic core is composed of two particles - neutrons and protons.
Quantified charge, neutron without charge. The electrons have a negative charge.
Before you examine the injured, you must examine the environment in order to ensure your safety.
You need to be aware of their postures and any dangerous alarms when you get in touch with the wounded.
If you get hurt when you try to help, you may only make things worse.
Research has shown the relationship between depression, fear and vulnerability to back pain and disability.
Only the impact of the disaster will vary depending on the regular weekly system of physical activity, and depression and fear will not.
Those who regularly participate need more support in the negative perception of pain, so that they can distinguish between chronic pain and the inappropriateness of normal physical action.
The ability to see or to see depends on the perception organs or the eyes of the visual system.
The eyes have many different structures, depending on biological needs.
Different structures have different functions, different sensory wavelengths, different sensitivity, and they require different processing processes to understand the images entered and different numbers to achieve optimal performance.
Population or total population means a group of specific species within a given geographical range.
It's called a monolithic type when one of the objects in one group is identical.
It's a multiplicity of variations when the body shows a particular characteristic.
The ants move and nest at different stages.
In the nomadic phase, ants move at night and stop camping in the day.
When the food available is reduced, the ants begin the nomadic phase.
Every pastoral or migration will last about 17 days.
The word cell is from Latin "cella", which means "small room", originally proposed by microscopicists through the structures of the soft wood plugs.
The cells are the basic unit of all organisms, and all organisms are made of one or more cells.
The cells are the foundation and the key to the study of life, which, in fact, are often called "the cornerstone of life".
The nervous system maintains the internal balance by developing a nervous impulse in the body, which keeps the blood flow unobstructed.
These nervous impulses can spread rapidly throughout the body and help protect the body from any potential threat.
Compared to other strong storms, the tornado attacks are smaller in size, but they destroy everything in their path.
The tornado pulls trees out of their roots, rips up panels on buildings and rolls cars into the sky. Two percent of the strong tornado can last for more than three hours.
These giant storms are 480 kilometres/hours high (133 m/s; 300 miles/hour).
For thousands of years, humans have been making and using mirrors for magnifying purposes.
But the first real telescope was made in Europe in the 16th century.
These binoculars combine the two lenses and make the remote objects look bigger and closer.
Greed and selfishness never leave us, but when most people benefit from it together, selfishness always leads to more short-term benefits for others, which is the essence of cooperation.
I hope a lot of people will realize that working with each other is the best way to do it.
A lot of people dream about the day when people can travel to other planets and explore other worlds, and some wonder what's out there, and some believe that there are aliens or other life on another planet.
But if it's true, it won't last long.
Maybe one day your great-grandson will think about their ancestors in the world of aliens?
Animals are made of large cells, they eat and digest within the body, most animals move.
Only animals have brains.
The earth is full of animals, some dig holes in the ground, some swim in the sea, some fly in the sky.
Cells are the most basic structures and functional units of life.
The word cell is from Latin word cella, which means small rooms.
If you look at organisms under microscopes, you'll find that they're made of a lot of tiny squares or balls.
Robert Hook, an English biologist, observed a small block of wood in a microscope.
They look like a room.
Elements and compounds can be converted from one state to another and remain unchanged.
Nitrogen, although gas, still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen, and the density of the liquid state is higher, but the molecules are the same.
Water is another example of a compound made of two hydrogen and one oxygen atom.
No matter how much gas, liquid or solid, the molecular structure is the same.
Although their physical state may change, chemical state does not.
Time is always around us, affecting everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
Religion, philosophy and science have studied time for thousands of years.
We feel the passage of time with a series of events in the future, now in the past.
Time is the way we compare activity with activity.
You can record the passage of time by observing the repetition of periodic events.
Today's computer is used to process images and videos.
Computers can make complicated animations, which are becoming more common in television and movies.
Music is usually recorded by cutting-edge computers, processing and mixing voices.
For a long time from the nineteenth to the twentieth centuries, it was widely believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Māori, who lived with a giant bird of fear in the name of hunting a bird.
This theory also establishes the notion that Māori left Polynesia in a large fleet, took New Zealand from the Moriori and developed a farming society.

The conglomerate mode of thinking is a solution that brings together different ideas and paradigms to find solutions.
The point of such thinking is speed, logic, precision, awareness, reapplication of existing techniques and data collection.
The most important element of this thought is that there's only one correct answer.
This way of thinking is linked to certain scientific or standard procedures.
People who think like that have logic and are able to remember sequencing patterns, solve problems and conduct scientific tests.
Human beings are the species that can most understand other similar ideas today.
It means we can successfully predict other people's perceptions, intentions, beliefs, recognition or desire.
Understanding the intentions of others is particularly important in these abilities, which enable us to better understand the differences that arise from the motion of the body.
For example, if you saw someone break the window, you'd have a great chance to assume he was trying to steal someone's car.
If he loses his keys and tries to break the window, he needs a different judgment.
Magnetic resonance, based on a physical phenomenon called the NMR, was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Brock and Edward Purcell.
In this resonance, the magnetic field and the radio waves cause the atom to develop a weak radio signal.
In 1970, Raymond Damadyan, a doctor and scientific researcher, discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance images as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, it's the first time in the world that an award has been made for a magnetic resonance.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the first "Magnetic Resonance Scanner" he called it.

Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth, surrounded by the South Pole.
Travel costs are high and require good health and can only take place in the summer between November and February, and are mainly limited to the islands, the islands and the Rose Sea.
In the summer, thousands of workers lived here, about 50 of them in these areas; very few of them stayed for the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is a desolate highland covered by a 2 to 3 km ice.
A dedicated air travel group occasionally travels to the interior, climbs mountains or visits the South Poles with large bases.
The South Pole is a 1600-km route connecting the McMurdo base and the South Pole in the Rose Sea.
The road is filled with snow that is compact and cracking and marked by flags, and only by a dedicated tractor with fuel and refilled sleds.
They're not very lively, so the route has to turn around the mountains of the South Pole to reach the plateau.
Most of the most common accidents in winter occur on wet roads, pedestrian roads and, especially, steps.

Some boots have nails and some additional equipment full of nails to deal with slides, suitable for most shoes and boots, for heels or heels and soles of shoes.
The heels should be low and wide.
An avalanche is not an anomaly; steep slopes can only bear a certain amount of snow, and extra snow can fall in the form of an avalanche.

Normally, you have to buy a global number on your own so that public phone exchanges can call you.
The actual text translation application is an application that automatically translates text paragraphs from one language to another.
Some applications in this model can even translate foreign language text on smart phones when users point them to symbols or other objects in the real world.
The translation engines have undergone significant improvements and are now providing more or less correct translations in most cases (less, if not more, unwritten translations), but they still need to be careful that they may be wrong about all the meanings.
One of the most prominent of these applications is Google Translation, which allows offline translation after downloading the required language data.
