Xinhua Times Review: Xinhua Networking for Village Resuscitation
Rural revitalization. Talent is the key.
Where's the talent?
A group of good returning farmers is an indispensable force.
Xinhua Xinhua Society
Xinhua Society, Xinhua City, July 26th, Question: Rejuvenation of the village by raking good migrant workers back home.
This year, at 34-year-old Zhang's home in Sichuan Myeongsan City orchards, he resigned from Beijing in 2010 to start a business.
After several years of fighting, he now runs a family farm of grapes that earns more than a million dollars a year, becomes a small, well-known leader, and is selected to join the village's two committees.
In recent years, inspired by a range of supportive agricultural policies, such as national poverty eradication, rural revitalization and so forth, more and more excellent farmers, like Zhang Yu, have opted to return home and start their own business, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside.
In 2019 alone, in the western province of the country, the labour-exporting province, Sichuan, which has led to the implementation of the Retraining Project for Good Farmer Workers, more than 8,000 village branch clerks have been drawn back from the highly qualified peasant workers, and 61,000 village reserve members have been nurtured, more than 20,000 development party members have been named, providing strong guarantees for winning the fight against poverty and implementing rural renewal strategies.
Can't do it. It's important to the country.
Since the reform and opening up, the country ' s rural areas have seen a huge increase in the number of young and young workers working outside the country, some of whom have set up their own businesses by spelling.
But objectively it also leads to different degrees of "blindness" in rural areas, especially the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations, the "old age" characteristic of village branch secretaries and party members, namely, ageing, low academic qualifications, weak village leaders, and acute problems of lack of leadership.
It's empty words to rejuvenate a village where elements such as rural talent continue to flow in one direction to the city and where the village is in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time.
Bringing back farmers who are capable, conscious and interested in serving their homelands, leading them back home to become productive leaders, training members from among them on merit, village cadres, and enriching the cadres at the grass-roots level, is a solution to the legacy of rural party membership and grass-roots organization.
Good farmers can get back and keep them alive. Good job.
In recent years, Sichuan has set up the Farmer Labour Party to establish, on the basis of strict selection criteria, institutional mechanisms such as orientation, security of services, training and skills, selection and use of good farmers, enabling them to improve their abilities, job security, life expectancy, real roots in rural areas and a sense of achievement in the entrepreneurial activities of their officers.
This year is the year when the fight against poverty and the fight against poverty and rural renewal are won, and talent is the key factor.
The Government of the Party Committees at all levels will attach great importance to the group of highly qualified rural workers who return home, and will, through comprehensive measures, create a viable, combatable task force, a vibrant army, strong organizational security and talent support for rural poverty eradication and the revitalization of development.
As a result of the epidemic, this year's university graduates were special. On the night of July 11, the Bilibili Summers will bring a special live live live performance for graduates, the wolf, Park Tree, Lee Woo Chun, and Mao's music will send songs and blessings to the graduates.
The famous pup leader, SealWu Yifan, also brought a weed, a rap song that he adapted from Lujín's co-author poetry collection and was very popular among young people.
As a result of the epidemic, a number of graduates failed to learn the sense of ritual in the field, giving their diplomas, and they moved the ritual to the online.
The data show that this 2.5-hour concert has a peak of over 35 million people.
"Follow your heart, seize your chances, take no account of the consequences, and sometimes you will have unexpected gains."
Even though it's a graduation song, a lot of songs move non-responsible graduates.
"The whole scene really wants to cry, everyone's youth is full of beauty and regret, but it's all worth remembering.
Beijing’s natural ecology continues to attract more than 500 species of wildlife cities to "settling" - the new Chinese network.
2020-07-26 05:03:17 Source: Beijing Youth Journal.
The natural ecology of the capital continues to be good, attracting wildlife cities to "settling."
Beijing has more than 500 species of wildlife.
The reporter of the Beijing Young News (Reporter Wang Bin) learned from the Urban Park Greening Bureau that the variety and number of wildlife have increased in recent years as the natural ecological environment of the capital continues to improve.
To date, the number of terrestrial vertebrates living in Beijing has increased to over 500 species, including brown horse chickens, protected animals such as black storks at the national level, and protected animals at the national level, such as betellings, swans, cranes, tremors, etc.
Whether planted in one of the urban forests in two rings or embedded in a small wetland between buildings, it not only brings natural pleasure to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wildlife to " settle in the city " .
In the summer, the Pine Mountain National Nature Conservancy, located in the Yan Mountains in the north-west of the Yingqing region, was a vibrant community.
One by the mountainside playing, and two by the side fighting each other.
At the end of 2019, in the Green Sea, which covers a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, there were 178 species of wildlife, including State-level conservation of animal gold sculptures and second-level national protection of animal spoon chickens, falcons, where nearly one third of the city's wildlife species were seen.
"In Matsuyama, wildlife is the true master, and our staff is at best a bodyguard."
In order to gain field knowledge of wildlife in protected areas, Hoyolyi said that more than 30 professional escorts were on patrol every day along 16 well-defined protection routes, and that there was a "turning round" every month, almost all over the protected area for a day.
" During the tour, not only do we have to check the recording of biodiversity, but also the installation of artificial bird nests, the rescue of injured wildlife, the installation of wild infrared cameras, etc. ... "
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in the Matsuyama National Nature Reserve to record the state of life of wildlife in the forest.
As the biodiversity of the protected areas continued to grow over the years, more wildlife appeared in the lenses, leopards, leopards and hogs became "resident guests" and the national level II protection of animal falcons was growing.
The Head of the Wildlife and Wetlands Conservation Branch of the Beijing Park Greening Authority, Zhi Minh, described the increase in the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife in Beijing from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 today, as well as the continued increase in species and numbers of wildlife in Beijing in recent years.
The presence of wildlife in cities is becoming more common and is closely linked to the increasing greening of cities in the capital in recent years.
In particular, a new wave of million acres of afforestation began in 2018, proposing the restoration of the urban environment, the enhancement of the ecological function of green lands on forested lands and the emphasis on the concept of near nature.
The plan seeks to interact with the surrounding green areas, to facilitate the "family visits" of wild animals, and the trees are also the honey source that animals love, the source of food.
I'm dedicated to helping computers communicate with the world around us.
There are many ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers to talk about what they see and understand.
Given this scenario, a modern computer visual algorithm, can tell you that there's a woman, and there's a dog.
It can tell you that the woman is smiling.
It can even tell you that this dog is very cute.
I'm dealing with it and I'm thinking about how human beings understand and live with the world.
Those thoughts, memories and stories, in such a scenario, may draw the attention of human beings.
The interlinkage of the situation.
Maybe you've seen dogs like this before, or you've spent time running around on a beach like this, and you've raised memories and ideas of past vacations, used to go to the beach, spent running around with other dogs.
One of my guiding principles is to help the computer understand what this experience is, to understand what we believe and how we feel, so that we can begin to develop computer technology in a way that complements our experience.
So, deep digging into this, I started working a few years ago to help computers produce human-like stories from the image sequence.
So, one day, while I was working on a computer, I asked it about the trip to Australia.
It looked at the pictures, saw a bear in a tree bag.
It doesn't know what a bear is, but the computer says it thinks that a bear looks like an interesting creature.
Then I shared with the computer a series of images of the house burning down.
The computer looked at the picture and it said, "It's an amazing view!" It's amazing!
It makes my spine cold.
Computers see a terrible, life-changing and life-destructing event and think it's a positive thing.
I realized that computers recognize the contrast between red and yellow, and that it's something that deserves positive evaluation.
Part of it is because most of the computers I enter are positive images.
That's because when people talk about their experiences, they tend to share positive images.
When was the last time you saw your own photo taken at the funeral?
I realized that in the process of improving artificial intelligence, it was task-based, data-based, computer-based understanding that created huge gaps, defects and blind spots.
In doing so, I'm encoded for prejudices.
Prejudice reflects a limited view, derived from a data set that reflects the same human image, such as stereotypes and stereotypes.
And I remember that technology that made me feel the same way that day -- the first colored image was calibrated for a white woman's skin color, which meant that color photography was biased against the black face.
And the same deviation, the blind spot, continued into the '90s.
The same blind spot, even today, is still in facial recognition applications, how to recognize the faces of different people.
In today's study, I think of state-of-the-art technology, which tends to limit our ideas to a data set and a question.
And in doing so, we're creating more blind spots and prejudices, which will be further magnified when artificial intelligence is used.
At that time, I realized that we had to think deeply about how we'd be treated in five to ten years from today, when we invented creative technology.
In human interaction with the environment, humans use time to correct problems, so evolution is slow.
Artificial intelligence, in contrast, is developing at an incredible rate.
It means it's really important, and we're going to think about it now -- reflect on our blind spots and prejudices, and consider how these prejudices affect the technology that we're creating now, and discuss today's technology, what it means for the future.
The CEO and the scientists have weighed their ideas, about the future of artificial intelligence.
Stephen Hawking warned: " Artificial intelligence destroys humanity... "
Iron Musk warned that this is a risk that exists, and that is one of the greatest risks that we face as a civilized society.
Bill Gates says, "I don't understand why people don't worry more about artificial intelligence. "
But these ideas -- they're just part of the story.
That mathematics, models, the basic components of these artificial intelligence, are all we can acquire and use.
We have source code tools open to the public to learn machines and make our own contribution at the same time.
Besides, we can also share our experiences.
We can share the technical aspects of our relationship with us, and how to make us jump.
We can talk about what we love.
We can communicate with the foreseeable future, and this may be more useful in terms of technology, or more problems may arise over time.
If we all focus on opening up discussion about artificial intelligence and looking forward to the future, it will help create a conventional dialogue and consciousness, about what artificial intelligence is, what it can be, and everything we need to do to achieve what's best for us.
We've seen and understood this in the technology we use today.
We use smart phones, digital assistants and automatic vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they useful?
Yeah, so are they.
They're not exactly the same.
There you have seen the light of the future.
The future will continue to begin with what we're building and creating.
We've activated the domino effect, which opens the way to the evolution of artificial intelligence.
In our time, it shaped tomorrow's artificial intelligence.
So let's be immersed in the technology that enhances reality and revives the world of the past.
Technology helps people to share their experiences when communication is difficult.
Technology built on online visual media can be used on autopilots.
Technology produces languages based on image-based understanding, evolves into technologies to assist people with visual impairments and helps them to have a better visual world.
We also see how technology leads to problems.
We have technology today to analyze the physical properties of our birth -- the color of our skin or the look on our face to determine whether we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data, to process data on gender or race, to determine whether we can get a loan.
Everything we see now, just a snapshot of the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now, it's a moment of evolution.
This means that what we're doing now will affect the way things go, and extend to the future world.
If we want artificial intelligence to help humans evolve in a way, we need to define strategies and targets and open that path immediately.
What I want to see is the direction of human culture and environment.
Technology can help us cure neurosis or other disabilities, making life as challenging as everyone else.
Technology works without taking into account your characteristics or skin color.
Today I am concerned about technology tomorrow and 10 years later.
Artificial intelligence can appear in many different ways.
But in this case, it's not an unmanned vehicle with no destination.
This is a car we can control at the same time.
We choose when to accelerate and when to slow down.
We choose whether or not to turn.
We choose what the future artificial intelligence will be.
Allow artificial intelligence to become everything.
It'll turn into a lot of different things.
Now it's up to us to figure out what needs to be done to ensure that the results of artificial intelligence are better for all humans.
Thank you.

The Black Land's Farm Modernization - Xinhuanet.
Xinhua Society, Harbin, July 26th.
During the summer, two application aircraft ran over 10,000 acres of high-yielding fields from the second operating station in the fifth management area of the Friendship Farm, forming two white lines, and the big words "first day of the world" in the green field, which were grown with black rice.
The station's station, Long Kong, says it can spray more than 6,000 acres of arable land a day, about eight times more efficient than drones and hundreds more artificially.
This farm is located in the friendly county of Heilongjiang Province, our first food-producing province, from the sound of the past rice-cutting to the sound of today's "Lunlong" Mada, where traditional Chinese farming and farms are transformed.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in the modernization of agricultural production on friendship farms.
Confucius described, on the one hand, their use of satellite remote sensing for precision fertilization, reduction of agricultural inputs and reduction of pollution, and, on the other hand, their ability to improve the standard operating standards in agro-mechanical fields.
During this year ' s rice production, the farm expanded the area of operation of satellite navigation unmanned plugging technology from 3,000 acres last year to 30,000 acres.
This technology makes seedlings more even, maximizes the use of sunlight and arable land resources, and saves 16 dollars per acre in labour costs.
Farming tries new technologies such as informatization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the country ' s largest group of agricultural machinery from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, there are currently 49,000 farm farm machinery holdings, with an overall field mechanization rate of 99.8 per cent.
Agricultural machine operations achieved 100 per cent GPS satellite navigation, 100 per cent precision seeding in dry fields and 100 per cent operation in dry field large-powered motor vehicles.
" Green agriculture, smart agriculture, digital agriculture is the way to modernize agriculture ... "
The friendship farm chief, Liu Qilian, said...
The key to agricultural modernization is technological progress.
Farm-based Heilong River Farmer Farming has in recent years played a leading role in the demonstration of modern large-scale agriculture, leading to the initial establishment of a modern system of agro-industry dominated by scalding, standardized production and industrialization.
In the outskirts of Friendship County, there's a 350,000 square metre agricultural machine fair.
There is a concentration of more than 140 farm tools that have been introduced in Heilongjiang for many years.
These agricultural tools and farms have witnessed the modernization of our agriculture.

Xinhua Social Council, July 26th, Question: My family is here for you — the Xinjiang Xinjiang Qiang Qiang Qiang Qiang Qiang Qi Qi Qi Qi Qi Qi Qi Qi Qi Qi Qi Qi Qi Qi Qi Qi Qi Qi Qi Qi Qi Q
Xinhua News Agency journalist Chen Sang Camp, Wang Li Wu, Liu Sha Village
On July 25th, at around 4:00 p.m., Fu Quinbao was wearing muddy rubber shoes, moving to the back of the house, and his wife Zhou Yin came back and forth to pack his things.
"I got a call from the village cadres to transfer, and I'm still movin' in the field."
Fu Quinbao says he's been running over 60 acres, growing rice, and now he's looking good, and " yesterday he took drugs, he didn't even have the tools. "
Fu Quinbao pointed at the pesticide sprayer in the corner and said, "No one wants their house to be flooded.
In response to the continued high water pressure and possible heavy rainfall in the lake, the city of Fatty, Anhui Province, is preparing to open the Jiangguchi River, which is home to the Fu Quinbao family, on the 26th day.
Jiangguchi is located in Fatsi County, adjacent to the lake embankment.
There are thousands of villagers in Chennai who need to be relocated in the towns of Yanjo and Miho.
As at 1600 hours on 25th, our fifth largest freshwater lake nesting lake remained 13.2 metres high, exceeding the guaranteed water level of 0.7 metres.
The kitchen at Fu Quinbao's was clean, with a bowl of pumpkins on the table and eggs and some halogene in the fridge.
"I didn't think I'd move it, but the water at Chiangguchi is still good..."
Zhou Yin said it's a flat house and some big things haven't been ready for it yet.
"Back up the valuables, refrigerators, TVs, big ones, for the time being, can be placed at the neighbor ' s or relative ' s house. "
The village cadre Wang Quanbao gave him a good idea.
Wang Rei was responsible for the relocation of 13 villagers, and one family notified that the settlement programme was to be confirmed for each individual.
The nearest settlement to the Fu Quinbao family is a 2-km journey to the Sioux Junior Primary School.
In addition to the big ones, the headaches of Fu Quinbao are more than 1,000 pounds of food and some new furniture.
"The food is ready to be dragged to the relatives ' house and the furniture cannot be moved. "
The couple agreed to put a stool under the new bed and raise the bed about half a metre high.
At 6 p.m., Fu Quinbao started transporting things to relatives in three wheels, and Zhou Yin continued to pack at home.
At around 11 p.m., the couple looked around the house, pulled the gate and went to the settlement.
"I hope the water returns soon."
Fu Quinbao said...
At 9:30 a.m. on July 26th, the reporter saw that the area was ready to divide the flood.
Zhang Ji-Kolin's family is strong and Xinhua-Jinghua Network
The sports boy's hot-blooded game show, the sports boy, officially landed on July 11th on Lake South.
The sport leader, Zhang Dynasty, and the sports assistant Lin Mansion are all over the border, with lindane and Fu-en-A-A-A-A-A-A, and the hard core of the power-publishing device like "Big-A" is on the field, making the show "Fire" more powerful.
At the top of the game, 11 sports boys are showing their strength, and at the same time, the "strength conflict" on the arena is being watched.
Among them, "The Strong Conflict" came from Joven the SuperA Sportsman, who, before the game, openly defied Xu Ji-bin, who was known as the "fashion boy" in the same track, had to sing a dance show or even say, "Don't lose the make-up."
A word of silence for the boys and sports leaders on the scene.
And it's more like a great fight between the gods, with the same power and power against the Great Demon King's Sun Kee Cheeky.
And their identities are unexpected. Sun Kee is a gymnasium-loving actor, Zhang is a retired SWAT soldier, and three warrior medals are won.
At the start of the game, the boys tried their best to pull out their little poles, and the protracted confrontations on the big poles made the audience sweat for them.
In a tense situation, Zhang Jieko, one of the leaders of the sports youth movement, was watching the war seriously.
He's also very careful at the point where he's patiently encouraged the young person who lost the game to help with every fault in the recirculation process.
And the sports assistant's house is a flower helper, and she doesn't hide her appreciation for the young people on the front line.
It's even more admirable to learn about the daily training of sports teenagers who are overloaded.
It's also the sport leader, Lindane and Fushien, with styles such as "predictors" and "Rungirls" with smiles to spread the tension.
In addition, Jik and Liu, as sports assistants, have made a lot of laughs about sports teenagers.
Fire at Nantes Church in France: parish volunteers acknowledge arson, peace and peace - the new Chinese network.
On July 18th, according to outside media, the famous St. Peter's and St. Paul's Cathedrals in Nantes, France's religious history building, were severely damaged in a fire and the guillotine was completely destroyed.
On 26 local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer in charge of guarding the cathedral had been charged with "incendiary destruction".
He admitted to setting himself on fire in the church.
According to reports, the local prosecutor, Jonas, 39 years old, a parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he had set fire to three of the cathedrals at night.
And his lawyer says the arsonists now regret it.
He entered France a few years ago by way of refuge, was sheltered in the parish of the fire and was admitted to the church.
The prosecution noted that recently, he had tried to update his visa and was in dialogue with the police.
But the church says it still doesn't believe that a very kind and smiling believer who doesn't speak can destroy a church he loves so much.
On the day of the 18 July fire, the volunteer had already been questioned by the police for questioning and had been released because of the illogical problems in the narrative.
It's a firefighter on the spot.
On the evening of 25th, the man was summoned again as a result of new evidence obtained by a professional engineer at the Central Police Office in Paris.
This time, the man confessed to his arson.
It is reported that if convicted of intentional arson and destruction, the suspect may face 10 years ' imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
Reports indicate that the fire caused serious damage to St. Pierre's and St. Paul's Cathedrals, that the organ was completely burned and that the colored window behind the organ was damaged.
The chief architect of the French historical preservation architecture, Brune, argued that it was conservatively estimated that the restoration of the Nantes Cathedral would take at least three years.
Global news: US unilateralism undermines relations between the two countries. International public opinion supports China's anti-American-Xinhua network.
Xinhua Society in Beijing on July 26, combined with the Xinhua News Agency reporter abroad: On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the United States Embassy in China that China had decided to withdraw its permit to establish and operate the United States Consulate General in Chengdu and to make a specific request that the Consulate General cease all operations and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateralist measures taken by the United States have caused serious problems in the relations between China and the United States, and that it is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unjustified provocations of the United States and to take counter-measures.
Andrés Bolks, Director of the Chinese Research Centre of the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateralist measures of the United States had destroyed the bridge of understanding between the peoples of China and the United States and had put relations between the two great Powers in crisis.
China informed the United States that the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu was a counter-measure to the unilateral measures of the United States and was consistent with diplomatic practice.
According to Patricio Justo, Professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and Director of the Centre for Central American Studies, the above-mentioned decision of the Chinese side is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure against the United States of America.
The U.S. tries to divert attention from the U.S. by pressuring China to cover up its failure to respond to the new crown epidemic.
Bambang Suryono, Chairman of the Indonesian think tank Asian Center for Innovation Studies, said that the provocative diplomatic stance of the United States had seriously troubled relations between China and the United States and that relations between the two countries faced serious challenges.
China ' s notification to the United States of the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal counter-measure, consistent with diplomatic practice, and reflects both China ' s principled position of firm defence of its own interests and its legitimate interests in foreign affairs.
The Tanzanian current affairs commentator Francis Semwanza said that China ' s decision was a legitimate and necessary response to American provocations.
In order to return to normal relations between China and the United States, the United States should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China ' s internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to win with China economically and politically and for the benefit of both peoples and the international community as a whole.
Ali Yusuf, Executive Director of the Union of Arab-Chinese Friendship Associations, based in the Sudan, said that the counter-measure imposed by China was a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustifiable actions of the United States side, in accordance with international law and the basic norms of international relations, and in accordance with diplomatic practice.
Previously, the United States called for the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston in grave violation of international law and fundamental norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the United States will rescind its previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the normalization of relations between the two countries.
An editorial published by Singapore's United Morning News states that the greater strategic intent of the United States is to block China and prevent it from rising.
In the face of the tight pace of the United States, China, while reluctant to see the US-China relationship continue to deteriorate, has had to take counter-measures.

Xinhua Society, Guangzhou, 26 July, journalist (journalist Mao) learned from the Guangdong Sea Police Department that recently, in conjunction with Guangzhou Customs, the Public Security Department, the Xinhua Society, broke down a huge group of smuggled oil products that had been smuggling approximately 120,000 tons of oil since 2019, worth about 800 million yuan yuan and stole about 240 million yuan in taxes.
The Guangdong Sea Police Department, in conjunction with the Customs Department, has gradually figured out the division of labour and organizational structure of the group.
On 8 July, the maritime police, customs and public security authorities carried out a unified collection network operation in Guangzhou, Fushan and the waters off the coast of Pearl River. Four ships suspected of smuggling were seized on site. The vessels and oil depots involved seized a total of 4,700 tons of oil and frozen a financial account.
It is known that the joint operation involved eight ships, two helicopters, and was coordinated by several operational teams to attack the entire chain of maritime smuggling, illegal operations on land and the arrival of 35 major suspects.
The case is being further investigated.
The relevant officials of the Guangdong Sea Police Department have indicated that they will continue to maintain high-handedness in the future in order to combat all types of smuggling and criminal activities at sea and to maintain good order in the area.
Hurricane Hanna landed in Medellus or triggered a surge in river water and flash floods and a new middle network.
On July 26th, Sino-News was reported by a comprehensive outside media report that Hurricane Hanna landed in Texas, United States, at 5 p.m. local time 25th, causing storm surges in Texas, rising rivers and potentially life-threatening flooding.
According to the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Hanna is expected to carry heavy rains in parts of southern and north-eastern Occidental, which may have caused some of the streams to rise and life-threatening flash floods.
The worst affected by Hurricane Hanna is reported to be the area south of Cops Christy to the mouth of the Grand River, while the Rio Grande Valley may have large-scale flash floods.
The Governor of Texas, Abbot 25, said, "Any hurricane is a great challenge."
There are 32 counties in the state that have been in a catastrophic emergency due to the hurricane.
The city of Cops Christy, a city with a population of over 320,000, has closed down its libraries and museums and its inhabitants are waiting.
Abbot also said that, at a time when Texas is suffering from a new coronary epidemic, there can be no more casualties from the hurricane in Texas.
In southern Texas, rainfall is reported to reach 6 to 12 inches in the night of 26 days, and 3 to 5 inches in northern Texas and coastal Louisiana.
Because of the effects of global warming, Hannah was formed earlier than the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
Normally, the first hurricane in the Atlantic usually takes until mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from the European treaty on the prevention of violence against women
The Polish Ministry of Justice indicated on Saturday that next week Poland will take steps to withdraw from the European Convention for the Prevention of Violence against Women.
According to the Polish right-wing Government Cabinet, the treaty requires schools to teach students about gender issues and violates the rights of parents.
A press conference organized by the Polish Minister of Justice, Jiablo, said that the Ministry of Justice, which he headed, would make a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family to start withdrawing from the Treaty on Monday.
The Treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
And Joblow said, "The treaty contains elements of what we believe to be harmful morphological nature."
The Polish law in power has a close alliance with the Justice Party and its governing coalition partners with the Roman Catholic Church to promote a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Douda made the right to hostility to homosexuality one of the main topics during the successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, the majority of whom are women, protested against withdrawal from the Convention in Warsaw and other cities.
One of the organizers of the protest, Lempatt, in a protest march in Warsaw, said, "The purpose of withdrawal is to legalize domestic violence."
Some protesters carry banners that say, "The Law and Justice Party is the Hell of Women".
The Party of Law and Justice has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
The Convention was ratified in 2015 by the former meso-government of Poland.
The law and justice party government has stated that the treaty does not respect religion and requires teaching liberal social policies in schools.
But to date, the party has not decided to withdraw from the Convention.

Bosonaro announced on 7th of this month in a joint local media broadcast that his new coronary virus test on 6 was positive and that two more tests were conducted on 14 and 21 days, with positive results.
Jiangxi has opened a green channel for young people on the front line of the flood response.
The recruitment office of the People ' s Government of Jiangxi province, Xinhua Society Nanchang, on 26 July (Ko Dongming, Kuo), has recently made it clear that individuals or their children who were prominent in this flood disaster relief mission are eligible for recruitment, medical examinations, political tests are qualified, and priority is given to soldiers.
" After the youths are registered, priority will be given to conscripting together in the community where the youths are recruited, after verification by the Street Armed Department and the military recruitment offices in the Xiangyang district ... "
Vice-Minister Wang Fai of the Xiangyang District of Kojiang City said that they had spent three days since 25 years organizing a medical examination of the young recruits due to the floods.
The youth of Xiangyang District, Kojiang City, is a 22-year-old university graduate, whose mother is a community worker, whose father is a veteran of an Air Force department, and whose parents have been on duty for more than a decade.
"In the news these days, I see my sons and daughters fighting to defend their homeland on the flood line, and I want to be like them. "
Chow said he's had an army dream since he was a kid and through this flood he's strengthened his determination to go to the barracks.
The city of Kojiang also uses the flood risk as a "viable educational material" for recruitment campaigns. They are community-based, calling upon young conscripts to volunteer to join the patrol of Chady, on duty, etc., to recognize the nature of the People's Army and to strengthen their confidence in joining the military.
Kaoyu, the political committee of the Xiangyang district of Kojiang City, said that, by giving preference to soldiers, it was hoped that more young recruits would be encouraged and that a good social atmosphere would be created in which to participate in the mission and in which to join the army.
According to the Vietnam News Agency, Grivori believes that Viet Nam has contributed greatly to the development of ASEAN over the past 25 years.
Viet Nam is not only a responsible member of ASEAN, but also an ASEAN locomotive.
Grivory indicated that Russia and, indeed, the Asia-Europe Economic Union believe that Viet Nam contributes to the advancement of ASEAN and to the promotion of its image.
He stressed, "ASEAN should therefore thank Viet Nam."
Grivory said that the analysts had endorsed the peace initiative put forward by Viet Nam.
Viet Nam is ready to share its experience with ASEAN countries and propose constructive peace measures on the issues facing the Asia-Pacific region, including the East China Sea issue ...
With regard to cooperation between Viet Nam and Russia within the ASEAN framework, Grivori believes that Viet Nam supports Russia ' s cooperation with ASEAN to help Russia gain benefits under this cooperation framework.
The Asia-Europe Economic Union, including Russia, and Viet Nam have been able to advance into ASEAN markets by signing a free trade agreement.
Grivory proposes to maximize the scope of the ASEM free trade area with ASEAN countries, thereby creating a platform for economic and security stability.
Grivori also believes that Russia, Viet Nam and ASEAN are on track and will achieve their goals.
From now until the end of 2020, North River Province will be equipped with the necessary conditions, particularly in the areas of infrastructure, human resources and land, to proactively attract foreign capital flows, especially multinational groups with value chains and the transfer of advanced technology.
In addition, North Jiang Province will be ready to submit to the Prime Minister of the Government the idea of investing in infrastructure development and business projects in the Viet Nam Industrial Zone and to approve the addition of two industrial-city-service zones in Anshan-North and Angang Province to the overall plan for the development of the Viet Nam Industrial Zone by 2020.
At the same time, North River Province has been working to accelerate the progress of projects, in particular the infrastructure development and operation projects of industrial park clusters such as the Twin Creeks and the Crown in Fu, Guangzhou, and the formation of land funds to attract investment.
In 2020, the North River Province Department of Industry and Trade participated in the development of industrial zones, industrial cluster planning and input for inclusion in provincial planning.
The North River Province has identified the development of clusters of industrial parks as a combination of defence security, ecological protection and food security, thereby contributing to balanced industrial development; and the availability of comprehensive infrastructure such as electricity, water supply, transport and telecommunications, combined with urban construction, trade services, workers ' housing and health, and other social infrastructure such as education.
In industrial zones, North River Province has made a strong appeal for investment projects in high-tech and clean technologies in such areas as electricity, electronics, telecommunications equipment, precision machinery, assistive industries.
In industrial parks clusters, the province calls for small- and medium-scale investment projects in production, the use of local labour, especially in agriculture and food processing.
In the future, North River Province will focus on accelerating investment in the infrastructure of the North River logistics centre, developing in tandem with industrial parks to optimize goods, currency flows and help reduce production costs, improve the value of goods, optimize supply chains and develop multimodal transport, thereby creating an incentive for investors to invest in the province.
Upgraded Russian helicopter gun card-52M first released at the end of the year - Xinhuanet
According to the plan of the Russian Ministry of Defence, the upgrade of the Russian helicopter gunship (hereinafter " Wuzheng " ) card-52-M will be completed for the first time in December of this year for the conversion and commissioning of the plant and will be significantly enhanced in terms of surveillance, communications and weapons performance.
According to a recent Russian newspaper, Wuzhengka-52M, known as "Super Short-Acquisator", was developed under a contract between the Russian military and military engineering units in April of last year, and the first two upgrades are currently being modified and replaced at the Far East Helicopter Factory of the Russian company Progressive Aerospace Group, whose national testing and completion will be completed by October 2022.
According to Russian experts who were aware of the upgrade, the super-clinic "former" -- Wuzhengka-52 was officially installed in November 2011 and the model was used to reveal a number of weaknesses, and this upgrade was designed to fill the board.
It has been reported that Ka-52M will partially introduce new protective materials that do not add weight and that its pilot cabin will be reinforced with new equipment to withstand missile attacks, thereby increasing the probability of battlefield survival; assemble larger generators to provide power for more sophisticated on-board electronic equipment; upgrade the optical system to detect and identify more distant battlefield targets; equip new light multi-purpose missiles, with a range of 20 km and a range of approximately one times higher than the range of similar missiles used directly by Russian active-duty military forces; and that its defensive weapons and communications equipment will maximize their utility to the Mi-28NM helicopter, which is capable of attacking air targets, thus making the associated maintenance simpler and more economical.
In addition, card-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapon targeting systems and navigation equipment.
The Russian experts also expressed concern that K-52M would be equipped with communications equipment to communicate with the drones, thereby providing real-time access to information transmitted by nearby drones in the air, such as images of drones on the helicopter ' s cabin screen.
As planned, the K-52M pilots are able to directly control the drones with which they work, thereby improving their knowledge of the situation on the battlefield and their guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, in December last year the Russian Deputy Minister of Defence, Krivarucchiko, stated that the Russian Ministry of Defence planned to purchase more than 110 straight cards and 52M by 2027.
Under the new Act, the Campania District shall be required to wear a mask in the public area from the moment of entry, and shall be liable to a fine of up to 1,000 euros.
On June 1, local time, Rome, the Italian capital, the Roman Beast Field reopened.
According to the latest quarantine decree issued by the regional government, residents of the Campania region are reportedly required to wear masks in accordance with the quarantine requirement in all public transport, as well as in all indoor public places such as shops, bars, supermarkets and galleries.
Violation of this provision is punishable by a fine of up to 1,000 euros.
At the same time, the decree provides for the segregation of all passengers from non-Schengen countries entering the Campania region.
The regional government will authorize health agencies to coordinate the organization of specific hotels to isolate the positive persons without symptoms.
The Act entered into force on 25 July.
In less than an hour, three customers who had entered the supermarket had received a fine.
River North, 1.75 billion cubic metres of ecological rehydration of river lakes since this year - Central New Network
The Xinhua Society Ishigiang journalist, Wang Qun, learned from the Hebei Province Water Department on 26 July that, since this year, Hebei Province has implemented ecological rehydration using a combination of water and water from the local reservoirs, moving towards the river, the Tang River, the rejection of 28 rivers such as the Ma River and white sediments, and has cumulatively completed 1.75 billion cubic metres of ecological water from the river lake.
Hebei province seized the advantage of increasing the flow of water through the North South Water Central Line project, using rivers such as the Tang River, the Sand River and the Dragon River to carry out ecological recharge.
At the same time, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs, including East Wusheng, and white sediments, have been used for ecological recharge in rivers such as the Blue Dragon River, which has accumulated over 90 square kilometres of water.
In order to provide ecological water recharge, the Hebei Department Water Department actively organizes water-filling river hazard screening, fixes and cleans the riverways, refines physical measures and strengthens patrol control.
Through surveillance and intensive unannounced visits, problems were resolved in a timely manner, ensuring the safe and orderly repair of rivers.
According to the relevant head of the Water Department of Hebei Province, the orderly implementation of river lake eco-rehydration, the effective restoration of river basin ecosystems in Hebei Province, the promotion of backfilling and harbouring of groundwater along the coast, and the significant improvement of the habitat and economic development environment along the river are important for the conservation objectives of the "water clean-up, shore green, river smooth and rivery" river lake management.
You should all know what I'm talking about.
I think the intuition that inequality can cause social disintegration and corruption predates the French Revolution.
The difference is that we can now find evidence that we can understand the effects of inequality by comparing societies with societies with different levels of equality.
I'll show you some data and explain why those data are actually connected.
But first, let's see how hard our lives are.
I want to start my speech with a contradiction.
This chart shows the relationship between our average life expectancy and our gross national income (GNI) -- the latter measure the average wealth of the country.
You can look at those countries on the right, like Norway and the United States, which are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal, and others on the left.
But it doesn't affect the life expectancy of their nationals.
There's no evidence of interconnectivity.
But if we get to know within society, we'll find that there's a great difference in health within society as a whole.
This picture shows life expectancy.
These are small towns in England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
There's a big difference between the poor and the others.
Even those at the top, whose health is worse than those at the top.
So income means very much in our society, but comparisons between societies don't make sense.
The paradox is that, in our society, we see relative income or social status, identity -- our interrelationships and the size of the gap between people.
As soon as you have that idea, you should think: What happens if the gap widens? What happens if the gap narrows? What happens if the income gap widens or reduces it?
That's what I'm about to tell you.
I didn't use any hypothetical data.
My data comes from the United Nations -- like the World Bank -- on the income gap between these rich, developed markets and democratic countries.
The way we use it, it's easy to understand, and you can download it, is to compare the income gap between the previous 20 per cent and the next 20 per cent of each country.
You can see that the countries on the left are more equal -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- and that their previous 20 percent is about 3.5 to 4 times richer than the last 20 percent.
But on the other side of the more unequal -- Britain, Portugal, United States, Singapore -- the income gap is double.
In this way of comparison, our country is twice as unequal as other equally successful democratic markets.
Next, I'll show you what this has to do with our society.
We've collected data on problems arising from intra-social differences, problems that are more common at the bottom of society.
Internationally comparable data include life expectancy, mathematics and language performance of children, infant mortality, suicide rates, prison population ratios, teenage pregnancy rates, mutual trust, obesity, mental illness - all of which meet standard diagnostic classifications, including drug and alcohol addiction - and social mobility rates.
We put all this in a factor.
They're all weighted on average.
A country's score is the average of these factors.
As you can see, these scores are more relevant to the inequality I've just shown, and I'll show them over and over again.
The less an unequal country behaves in social matters.
It's very relevant.
But if you look at the same health and social issues compared to the national income per capita and the GNI index, you'll find nothing, no more relevance.
We're a little worried that people might think that we're picking specific questions to suit our theory and then creating artificial evidence, so we also published a paper on the UNICEF Child Welfare Index in the British Medical Journal.
It contains 40 different parts, summing up from others.
It includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books in their homes, how many immunizations they have, and whether there is bullying in schools.
It's all covered.
That's how the index is related to the same level of inequality.
The more unequal societies, the worse the performance of children.
Relationships and their visibility.
But again, if you look at child welfare in relation to per capita national income, you'll get nothing.
All the data I'm showing you right now reveal the same thing.
The average welfare of our society is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They're very important in poorer countries, but not in rich developed countries.
And the difference between us and our position vis-à-vis others is now very important.
I'm going to show you some of the sections of our index.
It's a mutual trust index.
It means the proportion of people who agree that most people can be trusted.
This is from the World Values Survey.
As you can see, on the more unequal side, about 15% of people feel they can trust someone else.
But in a more equal society, the percentage rises to 60% or 65%.
If you look at the level of participation in community activities or the assessment of social capital, there are very similar links to inequality.
I'd say we repeated the job twice.
For the first time, these rich and developed countries, we've changed the subject of the test, and we've repeated it to 50 states in the United States -- the same question: are the less unequal states are doing all these assessments?
This is the relationship between trust and inequality that the federal government has drawn from a general social survey.
A very similar distribution of scattered points in similar levels of trust.
The same thing goes on.
Basically, we found that almost all the confidence-related factors reflected in the international investigation were also reflected in the 50 states we investigated separately.
It's not a coincidence.
This is a mental illness.
The World Health Organization, by random sampling, uses the same diagnostic interviews to collect data so that we can compare the rate of mental illness in every society.
This is the rate of the last year's population suffering from any kind of mental illness.
It ranges from 8% to 24% more -- which suggests that the proportion of mental illness in society as a whole is three times higher than in other societies.
Likewise, these are closely linked to inequality.
This is the crime rate.
Red dots mean states in the United States, blue triangles means Canadian provinces.
But look at their numbers.
Murder rates ranged from 1 5 to 150 per million.
This is the prison rate.
This is 10 times the difference, and the index function magnifies the difference.
But the range of incarceration varies from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main reason for this relationship.
In some places, crime can explain some of the reasons.
But more severe trials, or harsher trials.
The more unequal society is, the more likely it is to retain the death penalty.
This is a picture of children dropping out of high school.
Again, there's a big gap.
If we talk about the selection of social talent, we'll find this gap very dangerous.
This is the social mobility rate.
It's actually based on the income flow rate.
Basically, what it's asking is: is there a rich dad with a rich kid, a poor dad with a poor kid, or is there nothing to do with it?
On the more unequal side, Dad's income is more important -- for example, England, the United States.
And in Northern Europe, Dad's income is less important.
There's more social mobility there.
As we used to say -- I know there's a lot of American listeners here -- if Americans want to realize their American dream, they should go to Denmark.
I've already shown it here in italics.
I can show you some other questions.
Those problems are more prevalent at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with social gradients, which are worse in unequal countries -- not just a little worse, but two times 10 times worse than anything else.
Think about the cost, the cost of manpower.
I'd like to go back to this map that was shown earlier, and we'd put everything together to illustrate two things.
First, by looking at a picture, we find that the less performing countries, whatever they are, seem to be more unequal countries, but the better performers seem to be Northern Europe and Japan.
So what we're looking at is the relationship between widespread social disorder and inequality.
Not just one or two things are wrong, but almost everything.
The other important point that I would like to point out on this chart is that if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they show in every way that they're very different countries.
The status of women, their commitment to small families, in rich and developed countries, is at two extremes.
But another important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden has a huge income gap, but it narrows the gap with taxes, state benefits, generous relief, etc.
Japan is quite different.
First of all, Japan has a smaller pre-tax wage gap.
It's a low tax.
It's also less well-being.
In our study of the states of the United States, we found a stark contrast.
Some states are doing well through redistribution, and others are doing well because of the low income gap before taxes.
So we've come to the conclusion that it's not important to achieve greater equality, it's important to achieve it.
I'm not talking about full equality, I'm talking about democracy in rich and developed markets.
Another unexpected thing about this picture is that not only the poor are affected by inequality.
There seems to be a point in the words of John Dorn: "No one is an island. "
Through a series of studies, we can compare the behaviour of every social class in different countries with more or less equality.
That's just one example.
This is a picture of infant mortality.
According to the general socio-economic classification of England, some Swedes have been very kind enough to classify a lot of infant deaths.
It's an anachronistic classification based on paternity, so single mothers make their own data sets.
But we look at the so-called "low class of society", which is manual work without technology.
In the middle are manual work that requires technology, and in the top non-manual jobs, up to professional jobs -- doctors, lawyers, managers of large companies.
It can be seen here that Sweden is doing better than Britain, at every level of society.
The biggest difference is at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society has some advantages.
We've shown five different sets of data, including the results of education in the United States and internationally, and health.
It seems that, in general, the more equal societies show the most striking differences at the bottom of society, but there are also some advantages at the upper levels of society.
I should explain what's going on.
I think I'm showing and discussing the psychological impact of inequality on society.
More concerned with the feeling of superiority and inferiority, valued and despised, respected and devalued.
Of course, the feelings that arise from the competition for status have driven social consumerism forward.
But it also leads to indeterminate status.
What we're more worried about is how people judge and see us, whether we look attractive, smart, or something like that.
Social value evaluations have increased the fear of evaluating these values.
Interestingly, some similar work in the field of sociopsychology is also going on: some people are looking at 208 different studies; in the study, volunteers are invited to a psychological testing centre and then test their stress hormones and their reaction to stress missions.
In this observation, scientists are interested in what kind of pressure is most likely to raise the level of cortex alcohol in the body, the most important of which is hormones.
The result is precisely those tasks that include social evaluation of threats -- those that threaten self-esteem and social status -- in which others can negatively evaluate your performance.
These pressures have a very special effect on stress physiology.
We've already accepted criticism.
Of course, some people don't like it, and others find it surprising.
But I should tell you, when people criticize us for picking data, we never do that.
We have an unconditional rule that if our data sources contain data from the countries being observed, then we'll analyse them.
Our data sources determine whether the data is valid, not us.
Otherwise, there's a deviation.
What about the rest of the world?
In academic peer-reviewed journals, there are 200 studies on the relationship between health and income and equality.
It's not limited to these countries, it's hiding a simple proof.
The same countries have the same inequality measurement methods, one after the other.
Why don't we control the other factors?
I've shown you that per capita national income has not had any impact.
Of course, someone else has applied more sophisticated methods in the literature, excluding poverty, education, etc. in experiments.
What about causality?
Relevance does not in itself prove causality.
It took us quite a while.
Indeed, people have a good understanding of the causal link between our results.
The biggest change in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in rich and developed countries is how important it is for long-term stress from society to affect immune and cardiovascular systems.
Or, for example, the reason that violence is becoming more common in more unequal countries is because people are very sensitive to being despised.
I'd say, in order to solve this problem, we should solve a series of post-tax and pre-tax problems.
We should limit income, curb the top income culture.
I think we have to do everything in our power to hold our leaders accountable to their employees.
The last thing I want to conclude is that we can improve our real quality of life by reducing our income gap.
In that case, we'll find out that suddenly we've solved the psychosocial problems of society as a whole, and that's great.
Thank you.

In the last two weeks, the number of new cases in Spain has risen dramatically, with thousands of new cases occurring over the past few days.
On the evening of Saturday, July 25, the British Government decided to remove Spain from the safe travel list from the local time, starting at midnight on 26th, and that persons entering the UK from Spain would have to be separated for 14 days.
British tourists on vacation in Spain were surprised, worried and even angry at the decision, because the news was sudden and unexpected.
According to reports, the British Minister of Transport, Grant Shapps, is currently on vacation in Spain.
Prior to the British quarantine measures, Norway had also announced a 10-day isolation for those returning from Spain.
France and Belgium advised their residents to abandon their plans for vacation in and around Barcelona.
The beaches in these areas are overcrowded and social distances between people cannot be maintained, and the police once needed to take measures to reduce the number of beach tourists.
Tourism is an important pillar of Spain.
Spain: It's safe here.
In response to the British decision, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Sunday that the epidemic was under control.
The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Arancha González Laya, stressed to the press: "Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards but also for tourists."
The Spanish government is trying to convince the British government to exclude the Baliric Islands and the Canary Islands from the isolation measures.
The reason is that the rate of infection in these two tourist resorts is far lower than in mainland England.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Catalan region of Spain has re-opened the ban.
Tourism is an important pillar of Spain, which is one of the most favoured resorts for British tourists.
This decision by the United Kingdom is expected to have a major impact on Spain's tourism industry.

Xinhua Network.
July 26th of Xinhua City, Beijing, is the first day of the year.
In the early morning hours of 26th, the storm surged against the weather, displacing the heat and the heat that had befallen the Beijing area for days and days.
The Beijing Meteorological Station published a report at 1100 hours on 26 June that there were scattered showers (with weak lightning) in Beijing, with a maximum temperature of 27°C per day; that there was a low-to-medium rain (with weak lightning) at night and a minimum temperature of 23°C at night.
And from 24 to 25 years ago, the whole city of Beijing was at high temperature blue warning, with the highest daily temperatures in most areas at around 37°C and temperatures above 40°C.
The sky is the highest temperature in a year, the humid, the hot, the hottest, the hottest in the middle.
At the time of the ambush, the house was filled with barns, and there was a popular word about a dumpling.
According to the current forecast, the weather in Beijing is cloudy for the next three days.
Meteorological alerts the public to minimize mountain play, to guard against geohazards.
It's known that this year's midlife is 20 days, starting on 26 July and ending on 14 August.
When you get in the middle, you'll feel weak and hungry.
The choice of green beans in the diet, food such as penthouses with the effect of heat relief, stylish appetizers, and bitter food such as veggies can help to increase appetite and eliminate the heat.
The engine may be out. FAA has an emergency call for 2,000 Boeings - Xinhuanet.
The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency seaworthiness directive on 24 April, which required an emergency inspection of approximately 2,000 Boeing 737 NG and 737 Clasic passenger aircraft registered in the United States, as the air valves of the passenger aircraft in question were corrupted and could cause an air stop of the engine.
According to the Federal Aviation Office, 4 reports of air parking of passenger engines 737 NG and 737 Clasic have been received to date, resulting in urgent inspection requests for passenger aircraft that have been parked for seven consecutive days or more and flights that have so far been flown less than 11 times after re-entry.
The Federal Aviation Office warns that if all two passenger engines are corroded, the level 5 valve may be stuck in the open, causing the plane to lose all power and not re-incentivizing the motive.
This aviation regulator has ordered that, once the decomposition valve is found to be corrosion, the aviation operator must replace this critical component before the passenger aircraft is re-used.
Boeing responded later that day that the outbreak of the new crown had led to lower demand for travel, which had resulted in a number of passenger aircraft being blocked or used less, and that the " stop valves were more vulnerable to corrosion " .
Boeing also said that it had been recommended that air operators inspect passenger aircraft covered by the directive and that if problems were identified, Boeing would provide assistance in such areas as overhauling and replacing the valves.
The Associated Press reported that while passenger flights under the flag of major United States air operators usually fly several times in a day, a large number of them stopped following the outbreak of the new crown; as the demand for passengers has grown slowly recently, some of them have returned to operation.
The Federal Aviation Department has not issued any details on four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines revealed one of these incidents later on 24th.
In a statement, the airline operator stated that a passenger aircraft under the flag had suddenly turned off fire on 15 July from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, and that it had finally landed in an emergency at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines states that the engine of the passenger plane has been replaced and six passenger engines have been checked in accordance with the Federal Aviation Office ' s instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said, respectively, that there was no engine shutdown on the flag passenger aircraft associated with the air stop valves.
Four American Airlines passenger planes will be inspected and 28 United Airlines will be inspected.
Dharma Airlines said they'd check 20 passenger planes under the flag, but did not indicate whether the engine was out.
A lot of media reports indicate that the FAA emergency airworthiness directive is another shock to Boeing.
A Boeing 737 MAX passenger aircraft each crashed in October 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines in March 2019, resulting in a total of 346 deaths.
This series of passenger aircraft then stopped flying around the world, stopped production in January this year and resumed production in May.
Steve Dixon, Federal Aviation Director, admitted in June that the Federal Aviation Authority had made a mistake in regulating Boeing with regard to the 737 MAX passenger plane.
Xue Mo Fong's intellectual founder, Xinhuanet, is on the line next week.
There's a new art on the line.
The interactive knowledge-sharing program "Ding Up: Teacher" will be broadcast on the Hunan Vigilance from July 20th.
It is understood that the programme will create a new age-old class, with a group of talented and talented teachers coming up and challenging the production of interesting knowledge.
Unlike the serious impressions of the previous group of teachers in the minds of the public, "Tink on the line! Good teacher" gathers together a group of intellectual representatives of face and talent.
They're both youth role models from all disciplines, or a bunch of full-time "students" who shake their loads and are good at playing.
In the show, these excellent youth knowledge models, as "knowledge sharing officers", will challenge interesting knowledge classes.
They need to show the most interesting aspects of their discipline through an attitude of knowledge to reach out to the audience.
And the whole-age audience's question-and-answer group raises questions about how difficult it is for the knowledge-sharing officer to teach, and gives the programme a somewhat exciting atmosphere.
It has been revealed that among the "knowledge sharing officers" are high-school physics teachers Lee Yong Lok of the Chinese People's University, leading teachers Chang Shek Feng and history teachers Wang Ping with 10 years of experience, who will show their field viewers in an unexpected way the "hard core" knowledge of various disciplines.
In addition, Professor Xue Mofoon was invited as the "Knowledge Launcher" of the programme, to join the "Tinging Assistant" and "Duh Hae-tao" to talk to the audience about youth and to create the "Public Youth for All" class.
Chief of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: The situation is critical.
Xinhua Society, Hong Kong, 26 July, and the Chief Secretary of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Zhang Jianjong, 26 July, said that Hong Kong ' s new crown pneumonia epidemic continues to be critical and that if the epidemic breaks down, the HKSAR Government will decisively take more stringent control measures to further restrict the operation of its premises and reduce the space for citizens to leave the country.
But at this stage, the government has no intention of introducing a home order or a restraining order to restrict citizens from leaving the country.
On the day of Jang-song's launch, "The situation is critical and the disease is being combated."
He said that the epidemic had been the worst in six months and that the next two weeks would be critical in trying to prevent the virus from spreading further in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the HKSAR Government, self-regulation and cooperation by the citizens are also important.
He called on citizens to stay home as much as possible and to reduce social contact and meals.
Citizens should cooperate with the coercive measures of wearing masks to protect themselves and others, and focus on personal and environmental health and hand-washing, in particular by suspending non-essential family or friends ' gatherings or dinners and reducing them to the streets.
He stated that the Central Government had been keenly interested in the changes in the epidemic in Hong Kong and had supported the efforts of the HKSAR Government to combat the epidemic, and had responded positively to the Administrator's latest request to assist in the expansion of detection capabilities and the adaptation of the International Expo in Asia to work like the "Franck Hospital".
According to Zhang Jianju, the free virus testing provided by the HKSAR Government to specific high-risk groups, namely, homes for the elderly, homes for the disabled and nursing homes, restaurants, taxi drivers and property managers, has been fully implemented, involving up to 400,000 people.
He was very concerned about cases of infection in residential homes, and the HKSAR Government had arranged specific temporary quarantine centres for residents of residential homes.
He indicated that the HKSAR Government was constructing quarantine facilities near the Bamboo Bay quarantine centre located on the New Frontier Hills, with an additional 700 units expected to be available by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on 19 that the HKSAR Government would build 2,000 additional isolation units at the Bamboo Bay quarantine centre, with the aim of completing them by the end of this year.
With the 800 already operational quarantine centres, the Bamboo Bay quarantine centres are expected to provide a total of 3,500 isolation rooms by the end of the year.
There are currently four functioning quarantine centres in Hong Kong, providing approximately 2,600 isolation units.
In addition, on 24th, the HKSAR Government reactivated the Carpgate Park Resort on Hong Kong Island as a community isolation facility for patients under 50 years of age who are self-reliant.
"The Nutrients" of New China's History - the New China Network.
Source: People ' s Forum Network.
In recent days, General Secretary Xi Jinping, during his visit to the Four Pixie Memorial Museum, stressed that " more than 1.4 billion people, 90 million members of the Party, especially at all levels of leadership, will be well educated in the history of the Communist Party of China, the history of the New China ...

"Yang River Dream" - The Chinese Net
"Sai Qiangnan" search for poetry "The Yellow River Dream"
The Sino-China news agency, Sino-Kingkawa, called Yeon-dee on July 26th.
The Yellow River, which inspired so many humans, was the birth of a beautiful and rich Ningxia plain, and now the beautiful Ningxia, who has the name "Singnan" is insisting on the concept of "eco-priority, green development" in pursuit of the poetic "Yang River Dream".
"Bippo Dreams" by the River Clearwater Show.
"The Yellow River Forningxia." The Yellow River, 397 kilometers through Ningxia, is the Mother's River that raised one side.
But with industrialization, rapid urbanization, uneven exploitation and management of river lakes, excessive drainage, surrounding of fields, encroachment of waters, etc., leading to black odours, excessive water quality, environmental degradation and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is pushing for the restoration of the diversity of the water, trying to return the Yellow River to Qing.
Water has to be treated from the source.
In Ningxia Silverkawa, where the local approach is "Punishment plus Decontamination plus Tight Pipeline", the entire industrial park has been treated centrally, municipal sewage treatment plants have achieved all level-A standard discharges, cities have been built with black and stinky bodies largely eliminated, and the third batch of Chinese black and stinky water demonstration cities have been successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia ' s full implementation of the river lake system in 2017 has now achieved full coverage of the district and district village level V lake system, and the river lake cruise has become the norm.
At 64, he lived in a village by the Yellow River, where he witnessed the change in the Yellow River: "The previous water stinks, and after it's been fixed, it doesn't smell anymore."
He says that the environment is better and his life is easier, and now he walks with his family to the Yellow River to feel the blue sky.
"The Dream of the Wetland" by the sand gulls.
Flying birds, green trees, insulations, water... the beauty of Van inundation of the sand gulls has become a reality in the Yellow River wetlands park in Ningxia Silver River.
Yellow rivers, through Ningxia, form river wetlands, lake wetlands, marsh wetlands, etc., which play an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and the ecological balance of water, while also serving as an important international migration route for birds.
Since 2009, the departments concerned in Ningxia have accumulated funding for wetland conservation projects in the order of RMB 34.5 billion. At present, the area of Sinakawa wetlands is 19.2 million hectares, the rate of wetland conservation is 78.5 per cent, there are natural lakes, marsh wetlands are close to 200, there are five national wetlands parks, one national urban wetland park, six autonomous area wetlands parks and eight municipal parks.
The Deputy Director-General of the Swat Conservation Centre of the City of Shinchuan told reporters that wetland conservation has increased biodiversity and is particularly evident in birds, "The gulls are a endangered bird, with over 20,000 birds in the world, of which more than 2,000 are sheltered in the Henchuan wetlands."
At the same time, Ningxia has established by law a red line of 500 metres between areas protected by both sides of the river ' s Milky Way sector, stipulating that no unit or individual may develop or operate within the scope of protection except for public goods.
The Deputy Director of the Water Service Centre in Sinakawa City, Zhao Shao Yong, introduced the integrated management of river lake ecology and the construction of the last wetland through the management of the source of pollution, and now that the nine predominantly yellow drains have water quality of 100 per cent of the IV standard in Ningxia, "now the water is clean, fish is swimming and flowers are blooming."
It's a drinking dream for all of us.
Ningxia Silvergawa used to have an awkward title: the only city in the yellow city where the Yellow River is waterless.
Since 2010, the city has been faced with a continuing water shortage at the peak of the summer, and the "water shortage" of nearly 10 years has been a painful experience for many high-rise residents in the summer, but it is at the limit of the major water sources, which have created large areas of groundwater overflowing areas under urban areas, and water scarcity has become a challenge for the city.
As a result of the improvement in the water quality of the Yellow River, the drinking of the purified Yellow River water has become a good solution to the drinking problems of the local population.
Ding Ming, Deputy Director-General of the Water Authority of the City of Shinchuan, explained that, in order to improve the production of water for urban and rural residents of Shinchuan, Ningxia had, in due course, launched a water supply project along the urban and rural western routes of the City of Shinchuan to replace existing groundwater sources with high-quality yellow water.
" On 29 December 2019, the water supply project officially reached the third district of Shinchuan City, and in 2020, in the town of Guanning, residents of Herland County drank yellow river water ... "
Ding Ming said that the Singchuan water sector will take an integrated approach to regional rural water and urban water supply integration, "Next, we will integrate the rural dispersed water points into the West Line, and we expect to achieve largely integrated rural-urban water supply by the end of this year... "
Increased counter-reaction efforts in all sectors - the new network.
Increased response to disasters in all sectors
Goliath News Network (News): news from the Ministry of Water, today (25 July) at 1200 hours, at 0.64~3.31 metres, at 0.05~2.02 metres in the river area below the King Huai River Dam, at the middle and bottom of the Yangtze River.
It's been 28 days since Tai Lake was overguarded on June 28th.
Today, at 1200 hours, the average level of Tai Lake is 4.67 metres, exceeding the guaranteed level of 0.02 metres.
Today, the National Council of Defense agreed to continue to maintain the Yangtze II level response, demanding that the local authorities take full responsibility for the further implementation of the disaster response.
Today, the National Preventive Office, the Ministry of Emergency Management and Emergency Management have deployed Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian professional drainage trucks to help Jiangxi solve the problems of flooding in the city caused by heavy rainfall.
For the first time, the U.S. launched a countervailing investigation into China at the RMB undervalued rate.
In response to a recent announcement by the United States Department of Commerce, it was decided to launch an anti-dumping countervailing investigation into the Chinese-origin strap products and an investigation into the "undervalued renminbi" project.
According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, this is the first time that the United States has investigated the so-called "undervalued currency exchange rate" project in a countervailing neutrality case, which China is firmly opposed to.
In particular, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued a press release in this regard on the evening of 23 March, stating that China had adopted a market-based supply-and-demand-based approach, regulated by reference to a basket of currencies, managed floating exchange rate regimes, and the market played a decisive role in the formation of exchange rates.
The press release stressed that, overall, the renminbi exchange rate was reasonably balanced and not underestimated.
Since 2005, the renminbi has accumulated an appreciation of over 17 per cent against the United States dollar.
According to data published by the Bank for International Settlements, between the beginning of 2005 and May 2020, the renminbi appreciated by 38 per cent, the effective real exchange rate appreciated by 49 per cent, the strongest currency in the G20 economies and one of the most appreciated currencies globally.
According to the Ministry of Commerce, exchange rate issues are beyond the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with World Trade Organization rules.
In February of this year, the United States amended its legislation to conduct countervailing investigations into foreign exchange rates.
According to the press release, even under United States regulations, the applicant ' s claims are subject to numerous errors, lack of financial support, grant of benefits and anti-subsidy elements such as exclusivity.
China urges the United States to comply with existing international rules and to stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called undervalued currency exchange rate.
A further rise in tensions between China and the United States affected by the offshore departure of the renminbi, which was once devalued in the 22-day exchange rate between the United States and the United States dollar, and two-fold collapse of the dollar against the 7.0 renminbi.
Whether the US Department of Commerce is trying to push up the renminbi is a matter of concern.
The renminbi went up to 7.0 on 23 days against the United States dollar, at 6.9961.
Officially controlled median exchange rate of the renminbi against the United States dollar, revised downwards by 17 basis points on 24 days, at 6.9938.

Lewis' family: John Lewis is a warrior who fights for the weakest.
U.S. Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights fighter, was remembered as a soldier at a memorial service for him on Saturday, July 25.
Lewis' public memorial service has been in Alabama since Saturday.
There are two memorials on the first day.
On Saturday, at a public memorial service at Troy University, Alabama, Lewis' five brothers and sisters and a grandson spoke of him as a man full of love, fearless and family-oriented.
Henry "Grand" Lewis, the youngest brother of Lewis, said at the meeting: "He's dedicated his life to helping others."
Samuel Lewis said that his mother had warned John "Don't get in trouble, don't get in trouble."
He added that John didn't listen to mother's warnings, and he said, "We all know that John is always in trouble, always in trouble, but that's because he's sticking to the right thing, and that's a good trouble."
Lewis' brothers and sisters reminded the people at the memorial that John's most famous argument was to create "good troubles", that is, to do justice, to avoid provoking things.
John applied for Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, which was a white school, refused his application for admission.
As a child, John Lewis, who preached the Gospel to his chicken on his farm, was awarded a degree in Religion and Philosophy from Fisk University.
Many years later, the University of Troy awarded Dr. Lewis the Honorary Doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones from Alabama said that the current protesters were "peaceful and non-violently protesting", as Lewis had done in the civil rights movement.
Jones says: "Even if President Trump beats a shipman and calls all protesters thugs, he's wrong.
The protesters were patriots who wanted the United States to move towards a more equal country ... "
A six-day series of events to commemorate Lewis, which will culminate this week at Georgia's funeral.
On Saturday, Lewis' coffin was placed at a public memorial event at Troy University, where people came to pay tribute to the pioneer of the civil rights movement.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public tribute.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass through Edmund Pettus Bridge.
In 1965, he and the black demonstrators who demanded the right to vote were beaten up by Alabama police, who also threw tear gas at the demonstrators.
Lewis was almost killed.
This day will be called Bloody Sunday.
The remains of Lewis will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk and finish this last journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials require the public to wear masks and maintain social distance when engaging in events.
The Governor of Alabama, Kay Ivey, ordered a half-flame down on Saturdays and Sundays to commemorate Lewis.
During the week of commemoration, Lewis' remains will be divided into the Alabama State Congress Building in Montgomery, the Georgia State Congress Building in Atlanta, and the United States Congress Building in Washington, D.C., for public tributes.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and Mitch McConnell, Majority Leader of the Senate, announced last week that people could come to the United States Congress Building on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
As a result of the coronary virus epidemic, the public event to pay tribute to Lewis will take place outside the house.

According to the consultation draft, the school is required to arrange for physical activity for more than one hour per day.
In the case of cyber games, public security, cultural wide-television sports, cyber-monitoring, health and other sectors such as health should improve the system of health supervision of Internet Internet service establishments, establish a health review system for cyber games, and create a good space for interaction and a culture of interaction for the healthy growth of young people.
In addition, the consultation notes that patients with influenza have to wear masks to enter or leave public places, and that health care institutions are fined $20,000 for leaking patients ' privacy without consent.
It is worth noting that, in addition to the physical and mental health of the population, the consultation draft also requires that the Shenzhen departments assess the impact of public policy implementation on the health of the population before planning and building urban spatial planning, industrial park planning and construction, resource development and eco-environmental protection, development of the biomedical industry, regulatory documents and approval of major construction projects and implementation of major public service projects.

To raise the level of governance at the grass-roots level, to insist on the leadership of the party, by strengthening political leadership, building forts of battle, uniting red forces, promoting the party ' s political superiority, organizing its strengths and the strength of its people ' s work into governance, passing the party ' s strengths and claims to the end of the nerve, the last kilometer.
Focus on calcium casts and strengthens political leadership.
Political leadership in strengthening governance at the grass-roots level requires that calcium casting be done.
To make it a priority to learn from the socialist ideas of the Chinese character of the new era of the near-peace, to make it a permanent and permanent party-building and mission-building theme, a lifelong subject for cadres, to strengthen the principles of original studies, to conduct seminars, seminars, conferences, etc., to continue to promote the party's innovative theory of armedness, to promote greater awareness among its cadres, to strengthen the four consciousness, to assert the four self-confidences, to maintain the two of them and to perform their duties better.
To broaden access to learning through an online and under-line approach to learning, and to guide grass-roots party organizations and party cadres to genuinely integrate learning into everyday life, often.
Focusing on practice and focusing on issues of priority in the field of governance at the grass-roots level, focusing on the concerns of the population, resolving them well, stifling party nature and ability.
Let's get the rules up. Let's build the fort of battle.
Grass-roots party organizations are both an important part of the system of governance at the grass-roots level and an important vehicle of governance capacity.
To promote the normative development of grass-roots party organizations, starting with the rules governing the work of the Party's branches, the weakening of the leadership of the Party's organizations, the collapse of their leadership and the promotion of development through the establishment of mechanisms for networking, the creation of innovative branches, the normalization and consolidation of weaknesses, the establishment of sound decision-making mechanisms, and the provision of services to the population.
In rural areas, the standardization of the organization of village parties is strengthened, building standards are standardized against party branches, organizational forms are regulated, learning activities are regulated, management mechanisms are put in place, and systems such as "three sessions" and thematic party day events are promoted.
In cities, focus on street communities, explore innovative subsectors, focus on weak areas, blockpoints, pain spots, actively build a coalition of city parties to achieve effective coverage of the party ' s work.
At the same time, the establishment of institutional mechanisms for good governance at the grass-roots level, the consolidation of ideas, the sharing of ideas, the negotiation of ideas, the negotiation of ideas, the negotiation of ideas, the negotiation of decisions, the organization of decision-making mechanisms led by grass-roots parties, the improvement of mechanisms for the communication of party cadres and the servicing of the population, the gathering of people in the service of the people, the enhancement of access, happiness, honour, pride and the warmth of governance at the grass-roots level.
Play the vanguard, gather the red force.
Basic party cadres are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.
To improve governance at the grass-roots level, focusing on upgrading the governance capacity of party cadres at the grass-roots level, focusing on the role of "red cells" as a model leader in grass-roots governance, bringing red forces together at the forefront of reaching people.
The promotion of governance as a compulsory subject for members of the party at the grass-roots level, the continuous strengthening of intellectual and professional training, practical exercise, the spirit of commitment in the difficult task of the job, and the contribution to the development of the foundations for the modernization of the State ' s governance system and its capacity to govern.
The "Community whistle-blowers, party members report" campaign should be widely implemented, involving members in community building, management and service, including through participation in party days, contacting people in need, defining service lines, making modest offers, making reasonable recommendations, etc., and allowing them to play a role in community governance.
To play its full role as a non-member in rural areas, and to promote the active participation of a wide range of grass-roots members in the fight against poverty, in ecological development, in the maintenance of stability and in the fight against burning, among other things, through the creation of a pioneer non-membership and the formation of a task force of non-membership, and to improve the integration of red forces in the service of the people.
The foundations are strong.
The grass-roots party organization is the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by insisting on close party-group relations and increasing people's well-being as fundamental ways to promote innovative grass-roots governance can the party leadership be built on, and grass-roots party organizations can be brought out, tops, grass-roots party cadres can come up, push on, and grass-roots governance has a spirit, order, strength, effectiveness.

Coco Sicily's antelope is back in the season - Xinhuanet.
Xinning, Xining, Xinjin, Xinhua Society, on July 25, was informed by the Sanjiang National Parks Administration at the five-way station of the Coco Sicilian Administration in the Yangjiang Park District, that the monitoring showed that the Xiaomai goats who had previously travelled to the heart of Coco Sicily to the area of Treaan Lake were on their way to the end of their children ' s labour and had begun to return with their young children to their places of origin.
Surveillance footage near the five beam protection station shows that on 25 July, about 40 females and three young children led by the herds began to move back through the 302 km of the Blue Artillery Road, and that the five-lane railway bridge north of the beams had begun to move back.
Experts have analysed that, in recent years, the number of children with antelopes in the re-migration herds has accounted for between one quarter and one fifth of the total number of herds.
The Deputy Researcher of the Northwestern Plateau Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences stated, "In the early stages of the relocation, Tibetan antelopes faced a higher risk of being arrested for food, so that the number of cubs in sheep would be relatively small, and perhaps even without them."
According to the Sanjiang National Parks Administration, the number of returns of Tibetan antelopes has been on the rise in general, up from 4860 in 2019, 338 more than in 2018.
Even the new words: "It is expected that this year ' s return of the herd will be completed by the beginning of September, and the number of returns is expected to continue to increase."
The hidden antelopes are protected animals at the national level.
At the end of May each year, Tibetan antelopes from the three rivers of the Qinghai, Tibet Pond, Xinjiang Alkin Hills, etc. are going to produce lambs from Lake Cheonan, in the heart of Coco Sicily.
Our expert in the protection of the herds, Wu Xiaomin, researcher at the Institute of Animals of the Province of Tsangxi (the Institute of Endangered Animals of the North-West Province), said: "The return of the herds is the process of returning to the habitat with the young when the herd ends. The group of those who initially left the land is larger, but the herds will then return to their respective habitat along different geographic routes according to the population."
In order to ensure the safe return of the herds, the journalists learned that the former National Parks Administration in Yangtze Park has arranged for staff to conduct continuous video surveillance and area patrols in the main areas of the relocation.
In the event that antelopes are found trying to cross the road, the rangers will conduct temporary traffic control for the first time, allowing them safe passage through wildlife routes and ensuring that they are as little disturbed as possible by humans on their way back.
So, how do we get out of the summer in our everyday lives?
The experts suggested that it would be better not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, as the sun is the strongest and heat is more likely to occur.
If you have to go out at this point, you have to do protective work, such as umbrellas, hats, sunglasses, conditioned best sunscreens to prevent sunburn.
The clothes are as light as possible, fresh cotton, numb, silky as possible, less penetrating fibre-optic clothing, so as not to be able to spread the heat in a timely fashion while sweating, causing the heat to heat up.
When the heat is hot, you have to prepare enough water to drink in time, and don't wait until you're thirsty, because once you feel thirsty, you need water, you can drink water at 150 ml to 200 ml per drink, you can drink hot open water, you don't drink ice water.
Based on the high temperature, average staff drink 1.5 to 2 litres of water per day, and high-temperature operators drink 3 to 5 litres per day.
If you sweat more, you can refill some salt water and make up for the loss of salt due to sweating.
In addition, the summer body is prone to potassium deficiency, leaving people tired. Potassium tea is an excellent drink.
During the summer, more water-bearing vegetables, such as raw vegetables, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc., fresh fruit, such as peaches, almonds, watermelons, and melons, with water content of 80 to 90%, can be used to supplement water; dairy products can both replenish water and meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high-temperature environments should be appropriately supplemented with drinks containing potassium, magnesium, etc.
The summers are short, the temperature is high, the human body is rich, it consumes a lot, and it's easy to be tired.
Adequate sleep relaxes the brain and the system, both for work and learning and for prevention of heat.
According to the experts, the best time for bed is between 22 and 23 p.m. and the best time for bed is between 5.30 and 6.30 p.m.
Don't lie under the air conditioning vents and electric fans while you're sleeping, so you don't get air-conditioning and hot wind.
Experts suggest that people who are outdoors or perform high-temperature operations may carry with them 10 drops of water, humans, Xanax or Xanax or other anti-summer medicines, or be placed in a nearby workplace and be used at any time to prevent the outbreak of heat.
I want you to take some time to think about a very simple fact that, so far, much of what we know about the universe comes from light.
We stand on Earth looking at the night sky and we see stars in the sky with our eyes.
The strong sun so stings the eyes,
We can see the light coming back from the moon.
Ever since Galileo set his humble astronomical telescope on celestial bodies in the universe, to this day, the universe that we know is present through light before our eyes.
With the help of modern astronomical telescopes, we have been able to gather spectacular images of the universe -- a series of images dating back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent play, because it's not really silent.
I want to tell you that the universe has its own chords, and the universe itself is playing on and on, because space can be as vibrating as a drum.
So when something big happens, it can make a series of noises to the universe.
Now, we want to be able to add sound to this magnificent visual work on the universe.
Although we've never heard a sound from outer space, we should be able to turn it up in the next few years to hear what's going on there.
For this ambitious goal of capturing the sound of the universe, we focus our attention on the black hole and the prospects it shows, because black holes can hit time and space like drums and drums and make a very special sound, and I'm very happy to show you some of the voices we predicted.
One day in the future we might see a shadow, a black hole that can leave a shadow on a very bright background, but not yet seen.
Although black holes can't be seen, they can be heard, because they hit time and space like drums.
The idea that the universe can sound like drums comes from Albert Einstein, and in fact many of our ideas come from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe was empty, if the universe was empty, it would look like this picture, except for the help lines that were painted on it.
But if we're free to fall in the universe, if we don't have these guides, we're going to draw these lines, because we're going to find us moving along a straight line, along a straight line that doesn't bend through the universe.
Einstein also realized -- this is really the most critical part -- that if you put energy and matter in the universe, the universe will bend.
That's Einstein's great broad relativity.
Even the path of light will be bent.
When it bends to a certain degree, it turns around the orbit of the solar motion, like the Earth around the sun, the moon around the Earth.
It's a natural curve in the universe.
But Einstein didn't realize that if you compress the sun into a ball of 6 km in diameter -- that is, you compress the mass of the Earth one million times into a ball of 6 km in diameter -- you're going to create a black hole in which the density of the object is so great that if the light is too close to it, it will not be able to escape -- leaving a huge black shadow in the universe.
But Einstein always thought black holes were just a mathematical singularity.
He doesn't believe in a black hole.
He believes nature will stop the formation of black holes to protect us.
It took decades to use the term "black hole" and to realize that black holes are real objects -- in fact, they are very high-quality stars that die after catastrophic collapse at the end of their lives.
Our sun doesn't collapse into a black hole.
It's not really big enough.
But if we do some thought experiments -- Einstein very much likes it -- we can pretend to crush the sun down to a six-km radius, and then put a little Earth around it, like 30 km from the black hole sun.
The Earth will shine itself, because now that the sun is gone, we have no other source of light -- so our little planet has to shine itself.
You'll find that you can even put the Earth in orbit 30 km from the black hole and make it go around the orbit happy.
This black hole is actually about the size of Manhattan.
Before it destroys the planet, it could swell to Hudson Street.
But that's basically what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object half as big as Manhattan.
So we moved this planet close to the black hole -- 30 kilometers away -- and we noticed it orbiting the black hole in perfect orbit.
There are rumours that black holes will devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to be very close to actually fall in.
But impressively, from our point of view, we can always see the Earth.
It can't hide behind a black hole.
Light from the Earth, part of it falls into a black hole, but part of it is bent by a black hole and we see it.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If that's the story of Galactica in the Fortress, and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Our sun doesn't collapse into a black hole; it's not big enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them was eating up the galaxy, it would look like this.
We'll see the shadow of a black hole cast into the galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars and dust belts brightened by stars.
If we fall into this black hole, we see the light being refractured around the black hole, and we don't even feel that some big changes are happening at all, even as we begin to enter this shadow.
If we try to start the rocket and get out of there, it won't work well, because we can't run away, not even the light.
The black hole looks dark from the outside, but it doesn't, because the light of all galaxies can fall into the black hole with us.
And even so, due to the relativism of the time expansion, our clocks seem to be slower than the time of the galaxy, and it looks like the galaxies outside are accelerating, just before we're destroyed by the black hole.
It's like experience of dying, you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a complete death experience.
You can't tell anyone you saw light at the end of the tunnel.
So far, we've never seen the shadow of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they can't be seen.
Imagine, in a real astronomer vision -- imagine two black holes that have existed together for a long time.
Maybe they used to be stars, and then they collapsed into two black holes -- 10 times the mass of each sun.
Now we're compressing them within 60 kilometers.
They can rotate hundreds of times a second.
At the end of life, they approach each other at speed of light.
In the process, they not only bend space, but they also create space vibrations in the tail stream behind them, a real space and time wave.
When the black hole strikes the universe, it squeezes space and stretches.
These vibrations spread in space at the speed of light.
This computer simulation was done by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Relativist Group in Goddard.
It took almost 30 years to solve this problem.
It's one of many teams.
It shows two black holes spinning around each other, and these are imaginary curves.
As you can see -- it's probably a little blurry -- you can see the red waves coming out, and these are gravitational waves.
They're the sound of the real universe, and these sound will spread out of these black holes at the speed of light as black holes merge into each other, until these two black holes merge into one black hole, which is a quietly spinning black hole.
If you stand close enough, your ears will interact with these space squeezes and stretches.
You can really hear these voices.
Of course, you'll find out helplessly that your head is squeezed and stretched, so you may not understand what's going on.
But I'd like to play the sound of our predictions for you.
This is the research of my team - a relatively simple calculation model.
Imagine a smaller black hole falling into a larger black hole.
The sound you hear comes from a small black mass hole colliding with space as it approaches a big mass black hole.
If they're far away, they'll sound very small.
But gradually the sound became like a drumming hammer to the space, and it was as vibrating as a drum.
We can predict what this sounds like.
We know that in the fall, the little black hole will get faster and louder.
In the end, we'll hear the little black hole fall completely into the big black hole.
I've never felt that sound so loud - it's actually magnified here.
When I heard it at home, I felt it was a little weak.
Sounds like, uh, ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound of our research team simulation.
I'm not showing you images here, because black holes don't leave any useful trails, and real spaces don't show you the virtual curves.
But if you hear that sound while you're on vacation in the universe, I suggest you run.
Better get away from this sound.
Both black holes are moving.
Two black holes approaching each other.
In this case, they're all rocking.
Then they'll all be one.
That sharp sound is a sign of the black hole's integration - it will sound sharp when it's over.
That's what we're going to see.
Fortunately, we're very safe on Governor Garrett.
There's no doubt that, somewhere in the universe, two black holes have merged.
And it goes without saying that the space around us can feel the vibrancy that travels over a million light years, or a million years ago, and they spread at the speed of light and finally meet us.
But these voices are too small for us to hear at all.
Some of the world's experiments take a lot of effort to build -- one of them is called Ligo -- and it detects space vibrations that are less than one atomic nuclear range at a distance of every four kilometres.
It's a very bold attempt, and its sensitivity will not be overtaken in the next few years -- it will be used to detect space vibrations.
Another research project on the universe is expected to be launched in the next 10 years.
LISA will see super-mass black holes -- millions or even billions of times the mass of the sun.
From the images from the Hubble Telescope, we see these two galaxies.
Looks like they're still hugging together.
There may be a huge black hole in their center.
But they're not static, they're actually merging.
These two black holes will collide, and their integration will go through billions of years.
So collecting their voices is beyond the limits of our human perception.
But LISA can see two super-mass black holes starting early on, which is 15 minutes before they merge.
This detection is not limited to black holes, but it can also be used to detect any major disturbance in the universe, the biggest of which is the Big Bang.
When that word was created, some people mocked -- "Oh, who would believe in the Big Bang?"
This is an animated short film by my friends in Proton Studios showing an external view of the Big Bang.
We would never really want to do that; we want to be inside the universe, because there is no such thing as being outside the universe.
So, imagine you're in the Big Bang.
The universe is ubiquitous, and everything is around you, and space shakes in order.
14 billion years have passed, and this voice is still around us.
Galaxies are formed, and a group of stars are formed in galaxies. At least one of these planets exists on a planet, suitable for living.
Here, we're going crazy to build experiments, make calculations, write computer codes.
Imagine a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
It's been moving all the time.
We didn't even show up here.
It's getting closer and closer - 40,000 years ago, we were painting on the stone wall of the cave.
If we're going to get a sound from the Big Bang, it sounds like this.
Technically, it's noise.
It's a white noise, a chaotic bell.
But it's everywhere around us, as long as it's not offset by some other process in the universe.
If we can detect these sounds, it'll be like music in our ears, because the quiet echo comes from the moment we were created, from the universe we looked forward to.
So in the next few years, we'll be able to turn the music up a little bit, so that the universe will be in audio form for us.
But if we can detect the earliest moments, it will further our understanding of the Big Bang, allowing us to ask the most difficult questions, but also the most remote ones.
If we play the universe backwards, we can know that there was a big explosion in the past, and we can even hear its noise, but is the big explosion the only big explosion in the universe?
I mean, we'd have asked if there had been a similar explosion before that?
Will it ever happen again?
I'd like to say that if we raise this issue to the point that TED is advocating to trigger people's rethinking, at least in this last minute, we can ask some questions that we may never be able to answer.
But we can't help but ask: will our universe be just an episode in a bigger history?
Or maybe we're just one of the branches of the multiplicity universe -- each of which has experienced its own big explosion -- and maybe some of them have black holes buzzing, some of them not -- and maybe some of them have conscious lives, some of them may not exist -- that they do not belong to our past, or to our future, but are linked to us in one way or another.
So we can't help but guess if there's a multiplicity of universes, in other branches of this multiplicity of universe, there's life?
This is life in our diverse universe.
Is there any other life in the multiplicity of universes, and would they also be guessing about our existence, thinking about their own origins?
If that's the case, I can imagine them, like us, doing calculations, writing computer codes, building experimental instruments, trying to detect the faint sound from their origins, and wondering who else was there.
Thank you.

During the year of graduation at various universities, a rare on-line graduate art show was a warm opening on the weekend.
But it's not in the gallery, it's not in the campus, it's in the public space of the city of Yoo-yang, and it's open to the public free of charge until August 23.
The journalist learned that the 2020 graduate art exhibition gathered 50 pieces/groups of 57 young artists from the Central School of Fine Arts, the Chinese Media University and the Tianjin School of Fine Arts, and that the exhibition space was extended from two to six floors, making full use of the building ' s lightbox for the presentation of the graphics and maximizing the artistic atmosphere during the graduation season.
This exhibition is particularly relevant in the context of the epidemic.
"We have chosen to bring back underline the graduation exhibit headed towards the "Townside" and want more people to see young people discover their own exploration and understanding of the world, and to magnify the healing power of art for society and the mind."
She revealed that the exhibit had been collected from graduates of several art colleges and that it had been chosen from among the most suitable for commercial displays in the form of traditional racks, sculptures, new media devices, interactive drawings, VR landscapes, size and abundance.
Among them, Li Yun-shaw expressed his feelings in the epidemic through a combination of mechanical and manual creative language during the first battle of 2020; Liu Jia-Ying explored the themes of "encrypted currency", "credit creation", "trade" through the work "Sound Money" written in the Tee-Team chain; Zhang's cat forest and Quixian's "links" are animals often associated with human beings, where it can be seen that young artists understand the relationship between humans and animals; and Zhu-jun's work "The Winter of Faith" is a reminder to young people growing up, and remember that when one day a career is successful, remember that simple and sincere. "
Of the few graduates who have made their own displays, there are Lee Jung-goon from the sculpture department at Tianjin School of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7, when I was a little worried about the epidemic, and I did a nucleic acid test three days ahead of schedule with alcohol cotton and test reports."
His work, "Today's Enigma" is complicated and must be personal.
At the same time, he has the task of helping his classmates repair damaged works.
"Show till 4:30 a.m., then fix it. It's tight, forgets to take a picture of the work, and it's a little sad."
He hoped that when the epidemic became more stable, he would come to Beijing with his classmates to see his work show.

That morning, 65-year-old Bossonaro sent a photo on Twitter of him wearing sneakers, without masks, sitting in front of a table with breakfast, smiling face, holding his thumb up with one hand and lifting a box of hydroxychlorine drugs with the other hand.
He wrote in his tweets: "Good morning, everybody! New coronary test results: negative."
But there's no indication as to when the new coronary virus will be tested.
On July 5, there was a new coronary pneumonia in Bossonaro, the virus tested positive on July 6, and he announced on television on July that he had been diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia.
On 14 and 21st, Bosonaro twice tested for the new coronary virus, and the results were still positive.
During the isolation period, Bossonaro gave a number of live social media coverage of the hydroxychlorine drugs he was using and stated that hydroxychlorium was very effective in treating the new coronary pneumonia, that it was very good after its administration, and that its good health was due to hydroxychloron, which was advocated for new coronary pneumonia treatment in Brazilian medical institutions.
According to Brazilian media reports, to date, five cabinet ministers and 10 governors have been diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia in Brazil.
A small plane crashed in the Swiss Alps, and all four people on board were killed.
On July 26th, Sino-New Network reported by the European Union News Agency that on July 25th, local time, Swiss police informed the media that a small plane had crashed in the Swiss Alps.
Two Swiss and two Austrians were killed in the accident.
It was reported that the canton of Wallis in southern Switzerland had stated that a small aircraft crashed more than 3,000 metres above sea level near Mount Alpine, Valais, and that rescue personnel had arrived at the crash site and confirmed that all four people on board had been killed.
According to the Valais police, witnesses called the police on 25th at 12.25 p.m. to report that he had witnessed a small plane crash from the sky.
A few minutes later, the witnesses told the police again that the crash site was full of smoke.
The police quickly coordinated firefighters, medical and rescue personnel and took a helicopter to the scene of the accident.
After the rescue arrived at the crash site, it was discovered that all four people on board had been killed.
The police verified that the victims of the accident included two Swiss men aged 50 and 66, as well as two Austrians aged 46 and 50.
The police indicated that they were currently working with the Swiss Transport Security Investigation Commission to investigate the cause of the crash.
In Chongqing, 33 districts were hit by heavy rains, and flood yellow and orange alerts were issued.
On 26 July, a journalist from Chongqing City Water Department was informed by Chongqing that heavy rains had occurred in 33 districts in Chongqing during the past 24 hours, including 16 districts.
Heavy rains have caused 71 small and medium-sized rivers to rise, and two flood warnings have been issued.
According to monitoring by Chongqing City Hydrological Monitoring Station, from 0800 hours on 25th to 0800 hours on 26th, there was heavy rains in most areas of Chongqing.
There were heavy rains in 33 districts, including Kanaan, Kaizhou, and Soho Creek; the largest daily rainfall occurred in Yongshan village, Jinshan Town, Nanchua, at 197.5 mm.
There's a 1-7 metre water surge in 71 small and medium-sized rivers, including the South River, in Xiangzhou, where the maximum level of water is not overguarded.
Between 0800 hours on 26 and 0800 hours on 27 July, it is expected that small and medium-sized rivers in the Greater Chongqing region may experience different degrees of water-upgrading processes and that individual small and medium-sized rivers may experience super-police flooding.
At the same time, attention will be paid to the possible flooding of the Yangtze and Kaju River.
The CBA has come back to its first audience and wants to watch the end of the season.
20:26:01 Source: China News Network.
On July 26th, the C.N.N.C.N.C.A.C.A., official sources say that the Qingjia area has finally met the first fans to come back today.
On-site fans included Qingdao mobile staff and doctors, teachers, public security personnel, etc. who made an outstanding contribution to society during the epidemic. On July 31, the CBA Quarter is officially at war, and will officially resume selling tickets to Qingdao fans.
As a result of the epidemic, the CBA game resumed on June 20 after a break of almost five months.
Although there was not a lot of viewers on the 26th afternoons, the feeling on the scene was already clear: someone was applauding and someone was silent.
It's been a long time since the players on the field fought against each other, and the fans on the ground fought against the court.
In the after season game, if fans want to watch the game live, these are the ones that need to be noticed.
The venue for this open-bargaining game is the Qingshima State Sports Center Diamond Stadium (Shangshan District). The sale of tickets is made on-line, with a system of on-line real-name entry, and all fans must be 12 years of age and have a test certificate for nucleic acid for 48 hours.
I'll reward you for $50,000, and I'll pay you a compliment on the landslide of the sand dam, "Alarm First."
On 26 July, the Hubei Daily News (journalist Lin Jing), Ensch City informed Chen Xian, the geohazard site monitor who had made an important contribution to early warning of the landslide of the sand dam, and sent him a $50,000 bonus.
At the same time, it calls on the entire cadre of the city to learn his dedication, his commitment, his initiative and his dedication.
On 21 July, a landslide in the sand dam of the village of Tumburg commune of Nsh city led to the formation of a lake in the Qingjiang Riverway, and Chen Xianqian, age 58, was the first person to warn of the landslide.
On the afternoon of 17 July, Chen Xian became aware of the breaking of the walls of the villagers' homes and immediately visited the scene.
Just five or six hundred meters from his home, he saw the village road cracking four or five centimetres and stretching along the road to the corn floor about 50 metres long.
Chen Xiang Teng was alert to send photos of the road breaking to the local Geological Disaster Monitor Contact Group.
After on-site inspection and judgement by the relevant officials of the Tumburg National Natural Planning Institute, the possibility of landslides is high and a decision is taken to evacuate the population.
Chen Xiang ' s timely warning has earned 36 hours of valuable time for the safe evacuation of 1,339 people from 315 families in the affected area.
No one was killed or injured in this major geological disaster.
Chen Xian's responsible professionalism was praised by the public.
Faced with praise, he said, "There's no saver, it's my responsibility."
New drugs developed by the University of Australia are expected to be used to treat new crown-induced vascular congestion - Xinhuanet
Xinhua Society in Sydney, on July 26th, researchers at the University of Monash, Australia, are developing a new drug that will help prevent heart disease and stroke and hope that it will be used to treat blood-vascular congestion caused by the new coronary virus.
Researchers found that an enzyme in the blood plate accelerates blood plate condensation before a heart attack or a stroke.
So they develop a drug that temporarily inhibits blood plate condensation and thus avoids blood-vascular congestion and prevents heart disease and strokes.
According to researchers, this drug only inhibits the condensation effect of the blood plate in the event of a heart attack or a stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar vascular congestion is one of the leading causes of death among patients with new coronary diseases, researchers hope that this drug will be used in the future for the treatment of such patients.
At present, the drug has worked well in animal modelling experiments and researchers are preparing the next stage of human clinical trials.
The results of the research were published in the U.S. magazine Science Conversion Medicine.
He became the first audience to come after the CBA recommence allowed the audience to watch the game.
On that day, during the second phase of the Chinese Men's Basketball League (CBA) re-election competition in Qingxie Island, Shandong, 2019-2020, medical staff, teachers and public security front personnel came to watch the Shanghai Jiuqiang team's battle against the Mountain East and West Kings after completing the related process, including nuclear acid testing, through the official ticketing platform.
During the game, the contestants must wear a mask throughout the race, cross the sign and keep a strict distance of one metre.
When you leave, the audience will have to move forward, in the order between the two sides, and maintain an orderly exit from the social distance of one metre.
Xinjiang's Deep Farming To Sunflowers with Clean Energy - Middle New Net

Xinjiang Harmi, Sino-China News Agency, on July 26th.
More than 6000 pentagonal sunglasses, 48 square metres each, round and round, like a silver "Sun-Sun-Sun-Sun-Sun-Sun-Sun-Sun-Aunfield" , are reverberated with the sun to reflect the sun into the center's 200-metre-high pyrotechnic towers to generate electricity.
Reporter 25 saw this scene at the Harmi Molotov cocktail light thermal power plant in the town of Lake Chu in Xinjiang Hami district.
" The so-called molten salt tower light generation is the reflection of solar light through mirror concentration into the straw towers to form heat, and the conversion of thermal energy into electricity through traditional power generation technologies ... "
Jang Yong, Deputy Managing Director, China-Hami Solar Power Company Limited, introduced the idea that its design was similar to the solar stove used in rural areas in the north-west of China, and that it would bring the sun together.
The plant began construction in October 2017 and was connected by the end of last year, accounting for 6,600 acres of land, with a planned installation of 14,500 sunglasses.
"The greatest advantage of a conventional solar power generation technology is that the concentrated heat can be stored and generated at night ... "
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour thermal storage system set up by the project would allow the generator team to operate in a continuous and stable manner, free from light changes; it could also participate rapidly in the power-connected peaks, depending on the needs of the power-loading valley.
When fully completed, the project will achieve an annual power generation of 198 million degrees, saves standard coal by more than 60,000 tons per year, reduces sulphur dioxide by more than 60 tons, nitrogen oxides by more than 60 tons, soot by about 20 tons and carbon dioxide by more than 150,000 tons, and provides local clean and continuous energy sources.
In addition to that, there's another silver sunflower in the Rock City Park in Hammi City.
The Hamifor Solar Solar Power Station occupies more than 2,300 acres and the 714 installed power generation units also follow the sun and always maintain the Sun's light and the polyluminium surface at 90 degrees straight.
" We use two-axis tracking polyphoto-electric power, and through integrated integrated control, all power generation equipment will maintain the power generation efficiency from the Sun ' s altimeter-adjusted angle... "
The station's chief, Monky, said that the power generation technology could increase by about 20 per cent in light weather compared to traditional photovoltaic power efficiency.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million degrees of electricity, supplementing local electricity demand.
Ishigami Photovoltage is the largest single site in Xinjiang and the most Xinjiang-type photovoltage demonstration park in 38 projects with a total of 820,000 kilowatts installed.
In the first half of the year, more than 110 million degrees of electricity was produced, a 6 per cent increase over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the best places in China with solar energy resources.
The annual average total solar radiation is more than 6,200 MJ per square metre, which is around 3,200 hours per day throughout the year.
In recent years, the city has been developing a dynamic light industry and growing sunflowers.
With more than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power installed, the city generated more than 1.4 billion degrees of photovoltaic power in the first half of the year, an increase of about 14 per cent over the same period.
At present, Xinjiang has more than 330 optical voltage stations with a capacity of over 10 million kilowatts.
Photovoltaic power generation is expected to reach 15 billion degrees throughout the year, replacing the standard 6 million tons of coal.
The police informed us about the missing female college student tour in the Qinghai.
On July 26th, Xinning, the Xinhua Society called "A female student who lost her connection after travelling to Qing Hae-kook".
The Public Security Bureau of the City of Germu, Haisi Mongol Autonomous Province, Qinghai Province, informed that a student at a university in Nanjing is still in a state of disharmony, and that the police are actively engaged in search work along a lost land in the Yellow Sea.
On 10 July 2020, the Security Branch of the City of Germu, Heissi State, was informed by their superiors that a student of a university in Nanjing, from Nanjing to Germ, was travelling in a Z164 train on 5 July, and that on 9 July, at the Sonamdaj protection station in the Tamale district of Tamaki, Qinghai Province, the south-west part of the river, was not connected and requested assistance in locating the unit.
According to the investigation carried out by the Public Security Bureau of the city of Germ, Huang Xiang had entered the territory of Qinghai province at 1954 hours on 6 July and arrived in the city of Germ at 0400 hours on 7 July.
On the same day, at 0800 hours, one of the missing persons took a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in the city of Germ towards G109, and at 1200 hours he arrived at the protection station in Cissonan Daj, Coco, and the taxi driver returned alone, and at 1500 hours on a certain 7th, he arrived in the area of the river near the protection station in Sonam Daj until 1800 hours on 9 September.
In a further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed the Nagyu checkpoint at 1707 hours on 13 July.
In view of the lack of video surveillance at the checkpoint in the city of Naque, Tibet Autonomous Region, which was set up at the south entrance of the city, it was impossible to determine who was involved and the vehicle in which he was travelling, the police were able to search by car and coordinate with the public security department of the city of Görgömong if any of the checkpoints along the Tibetan route were found.
According to the latest information, at 1 a.m. on 26 July, the city ' s Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment to the protected spring station along the Qingzhou road, which was searched for and actively contacted the Sichuan police, the Tibetan police, the Nanjing police and worked together, and search and rescue work is continuing.
The local police are hoping that if there are any relevant leads from a wide range of online and social groups, they will provide them with information in a timely manner and with the Nanjing Gangning police in an effort to locate the missing person at an early date.
At the same time, the experts suggest that tourists conduct their outdoor activities in a regular, rational, civilized manner, keep an eye on the signs of roadside alerts, do not venture into an uninhabited area, encounter an unexpected situation, and call the police in a timely manner.
The American media revealed the truth about the unprovoked demand by the US to shut down China's Consulate General in Houston.
2020-07-26 14:40:44 Source: Yoon Vision Network.
The American media uncovered the fact that the US side had no reason to demand that China close its Consulate General in Houston.
On 24 September, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the United States Embassy in China that China had decided to withdraw its permit for the establishment and operation of the Consulate General of the United States in Chengdu and to make a specific request to the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities as a counter-measure to the United States party ' s sudden demand for the closure of the Consulate General in Houston on 21 January.
This act of the United States Government is a source of concern, and its political motives have been questioned by outsiders and scholars.
Why do you ask China to close the Consulate General?
According to many foreign agents, it is not clear why the United States would choose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, the foreign media has made a forthright statement: for the sake of the general election...
U.S. CNN 23 reported that the US side’s call for China’s General Consulate in Houston to close had raised questions about its political motives.
According to the article, the United States government’s response to the devastating new crown epidemic caused President Trump’s low voter turnout in the run-up to the elections.
White House officials privately claimed that the hard-line strategy against China was to save Trump's support and also to shift responsibility for the failure of the White House epidemic.
According to the article, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston was chosen by the United States as a "politically driven and cautious target", and the United States Government chose it as "in order to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflict".
The BBC also believes that when the US election season comes and the US economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that "Chinese cards have a political advantage".
The current state of affairs is "a spiral-up, back-to-back struggle", driven in part by the United States Government from a domestic point of view, which only exacerbates tensions between the United States and the United States.
According to the United States Colombian Broadcasting Corporation (CBS), Trump's prospects for re-election have been strained by the outbreak, and he has repeatedly accused China of the epidemic.
The United States has almost every day a new action against Trump's absurd claim to "China exploits America".
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries."
The Associated Press commented that the United States demand that China close its Consulate General in Houston had increased tensions between the two largest economies in the world.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic influence, Chinese citizens in the south of the United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as do United States citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston expressed regret that the United States had asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston, stating that the Consulate General played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of the Chinese economy.
The American Foreign Policy Journal website considers this move by the American side as part of a series of provocative initiatives that only worsen US-China relations."
Reuters quotes Jonathan Polak, an expert on East Asia from the Brookings Institution of the American think tank, who, since the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, has not thought of anything comparable to the United States operation against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
According to Hong Kong's "South China Morning" report, this move by the United States was unprecedented in diplomatic relations between China and the United States for more than 40 years.
According to analysts, this move could cause persistent damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 and was the first Chinese Consulate General opened in the United States.
At present, China has an embassy and five consulates in the United States.

In 1696, the Tsar Peters made the history of the Russian Navy by forming a marine fleet.
The last Sunday of July of every year is the Russian Navy Day.
In response to new changes in the prevention and control of the epidemic, since 17 July Xinjiang trade unions at all levels have been actively involved in the prevention and control of the epidemic, in response to the call of the General Trade Union of the Autonomous Communities.
North-South trade union cadres, workers, model workers walk into the street community, and among the population, they carry out activities such as feeding, disinfecting and disseminating information about the disease, and they serve the public and demonstrate the union's hard-core forces with practical action.
In recent days, the Tianshan General Trade Union in Urumqi has sent a much-needed supply of disease prevention and control supplies to staff in 12 isolation points.
In the wake of the epidemic, the Tianshan region has invested more than 1.05 million yuan for the first time, allocating to 23 straight trade unions on an emergency basis.
Deputy Secretary of the Xinjiang Construction Worker I Party Committee, the president of the trade union, Zhao Sang-guk, after receiving notification of the company ' s control of the outbreak, offered to stay on duty and escort the workers.
He delivers cookers, food and day items for workers living in the dormitories and new entrants, and arranges for them to be provided every two days with essential items for life.
"As of 21 July, a survey was carried out of the cadres on the front line of the war and, by means of an on-line list, the merchants delivered the goods to the house, first of all, the 704 first-line workers in the Urumqi region to supplement their purchases of anti-epidemic supplies and living materials... "
The head of the Xinjiang Transport Union told journalists that, in the face of the outbreak, they were fully committed to providing protection against the epidemic, steadily advancing transport development efforts and creating a strong climate for the fight against the epidemic.
At the height of the summer, unions at all levels are focusing on frontline workers in priority areas of epidemic prevention and control, putting "Cool" care into practice.
On 19 July, the General Union of Urumqi County launched a "sweet-down" condolence campaign for frontline workers on disease prevention and control. The county police station, card points and the health system received condolences such as drinks and fruit.
"Commonists need to further improve political positions, strengthen their responsibilities, care for their hearts and minds, and inspire action.
To ensure that trade union organizations are able to unite their workers, unite them, provide protection against the epidemic, actively defend the health and interests of the workers at large and bring care to first-line workers ... "

Speaker at the British Embassy: The Chinese Government is a firm defender of cyber security - China New Network
On July 26th, China-Newsnet reported on the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom that on July 25, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom asked journalists about the false comments about the attacks.
The Chinese Government, as a firm defender of cyber security, had always opposed and combated cyberattacks and cybercrime in any form.
Questions were asked by journalists: according to the media, hacker organizations linked to China had interfered with a British company network system, launched attacks on British-American technology companies with proprietary data and invaded the European Union national government network.
The Chinese Government, as a firm defender of cybersecurity, had always been firmly opposed to and combated any form of cyberattacks and cybercrime.
The virtual nature of cyberspace, the difficulties of traceability, the diversity of actors should be supported by sufficient evidence in the investigation and qualitativeization of cyber-events.
According to the speaker, the past series of events such as the Prism Gate proved that the United States had been conducting the largest cyber-sealing operation in the world.
It is in the common interest of all States to maintain peace and stability in cyberspace.
China ' s achievements in science, technology and innovation had not been stolen, but had been made through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted some 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), an annual growth rate of 10.6 per cent, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a major innovation and intellectual property power.
According to data from the Urumqi Central Branch of the People ' s Bank of China, in the first half of the year, new loans from Xinjiang-based farmers and micro-enterprises were increased by more than 2019.
In the first half of this year, the People ' s Bank ' s Ulrumzi Central Branch, using a variety of monetary policy instruments, led the banking sector to increase lending and provide adequate financial guarantees for the prevention of the epidemic and the resumption of work.
Most of the Urumqi free nucleic acid tests are almost complete.
On 26 July, the Director of the Urumqi Health Care Commission of Urumqi (journalist Sun Tinwen Zhao Yamin), Zhang Wei, in a briefing on the latest outbreak and test of nucleic acid in Urumqi city, said that most areas of Urumqi were now almost complete.
The development of the epidemic is being further assessed by experts from the State Council and the Autonomous Region, Urumzi City, based on the results of the nucleic acid testing and epidemiology survey.
The Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region Press Office held a press conference on Xinjiang outbreak and control.
According to him, between 000 and 2400 hours on 25 July, 22 new cases of coronary pneumonia were diagnosed in the city of Urumuzzi (of which 5 were confirmed cases of non-symptomatic infections), and 38 new cases of non-symptomatic infections.
As at 2400 hours on 25 July, 135 confirmed cases and 147 cases of non-symptomatic infections were available in the city of Urumuzzi.
Twenty-five days of new non-symptomatic infections have also been actively screened through free nucleic acid testing throughout the city.
The Director of the Health Care Commission of Urumzi City, Zhang Wei, stated on 26 days that most of the free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi city had been largely completed.
He added that, from experience in other parts of the country, there were a number of factors that affected the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of test agents, the time of infection and discharge of the person being tested, the cooperation of the person being tested at the time of sample extraction (which could lead to the absence of specimens) and the environment for testing, and the operational proficiency of the person being tested.
For a variety of reasons, the nucleic acid test also produces false negative results.
A false negative means that the person being tested is actually infected, but the nucleic acid test results are negative.
In addition, in the case of a suspected close contact, it usually takes two nucleic acid tests to exclude.
For those who have been to high-risk areas of the epidemic, it is possible that a negative nucleic acid test may be false if there is heat and respiratory symptoms, and therefore two nucleic acid tests are required to exclude it.
In the light of the above, he states that, for the sake of the health of the entire population of the city, the city of Urumqi will, as of today, conduct a second free test of nucleic acid in the Tian Mountains, the Shaybak district and other priority areas, together with a "recovery " .
In Tianshan, Shaybak district is known to be a high-risk area.
On-line, we're cutting the clouds down, and Shanghai International Film Festival has a very unusual industrial confidence - the new medium.
2020-07-26 06:52:39 Source: Reports by Wang Shih-seok, responsible editor: Wang Shih-seok
We've got a lot of industry confidence in Shanghai International Film Festival.
Yesterday, in the context of strict quarantine measures, the Shanghai International Film and Television Festival 2020 was launched as an industry summit forum on the theme "A full-scale journey to a new era of dreams", opening the scene of the twenty-third Shanghai International Film Festival.
This year ' s Shanghai International Film Festival is of great significance as the first international film festival since the continued spread of the global epidemic and the normalization of our epidemic prevention and control.
The Shanghai International Film and Television Festival, based on good efforts to prevent and control the epidemic, is both a sign of confidence and a signal of determination – the determination to overcome the epidemic, the determination to hold a people's day, the determination to build a global centre for film creation, and the determination to sound the "Shanghai Culture" brand.
Every year, the Shanghai International Film Festival, in its innovative and progressive gesture, is a new beginning.
Therefore, every step needs to be taken to serve the spiritual well-being of the population and the high-quality development of the film industry.
It's more this year than ever.
In order to value the hard-won epidemic prevention and control situation, Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, has strictly adhered to the quarantine requirements and implemented measures to prevent and control the epidemic; on the other hand, it has set in motion a multi-platform campaign that has been carried out on the line with the vision of gathering wisdom for Chinese film creation and meeting the needs of visions.
On the first day of the opening, from the under-line viewing to the industry forum, film festival-related events strictly implemented the relevant vaccination policy.
Forum activities are controlled within 50 persons, with each sighting partition being secured at a maximum of 30 per cent.
As the Film Festival Committee holds, it's a big premise, however, to put people's lives and physical health first.
There's a lot of thinner activity on the line, and "on the clouds" is a lot of fun.
To follow up on the important idea of "People's Cities: People's Cities for People", this year's Shanghai International Film Festival is a festival for the general public to innovate, seek transformation, use the online " Cloud Show" and the "Mount Sharing" initiative to meet the diverse needs of fans.
On the first day of the festival, the official partners of the film festival, Mt. Mt. Goo, and the East Menghurst, each of them will be in the clouds with a "Scree of Videos" back to the fans.
On that evening, the King's opening forum and Master Jashuko Ban were also video-taping, learning about powerful countries, and using several platforms such as Human Resources App to keep the population informed about the latest developments in Chinese films.
At yesterday ' s opening forum, the Deputy President of the Central Radio and Television Party, Jin Xiao Minh, delivered a message and declared the opening of the film festival, which was delivered by the Standing Committee of the Shanghai City Council, the Minister of Advocacy, Zhou Hye Lin, and the Deputy Mayor, Zong Minh.
White House Epidemic Specialist Foggy: Be cautiously optimistic about the vaccine that was developed in early 2021.
Forge 25 made the above statement on a web-based videoconference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation.
He cautioned that it was not yet clear how the new crown epidemic would develop in autumn and winter and how the final effects of the epidemic would end, and that the only way to end it was for each and every one of us to choose to be part of the solution."
According to data from Johns Hopkins University in the United States, the number of confirmed cases in the United States had reached 4,176,000 at 2100 hours on 25th, with 146,000 deaths.
Foggy says that some parts of the United States are struggling to fight the rebound.
Although the epidemic varies from one region to another and requires a tailored response, a diversified response does not mean that there is no close connection between the regions.
The epidemic in one region will eventually affect the rest of the world.
"This is not the time for complacency," Foggy said, "Our work is not done, we must step up our efforts, and we must be vigilant about the uncertainty of the future."
A Chinese medical expert, founder of the AIDS cocktail therapy, noted at the conference that America's new crown epidemic has not yet reached its peak.
"Every one of us must do our part to slow the spread of this virus... "
What's the big call for the public to use their own practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up the development of new canopy treatment drugs and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization aimed at promoting international exchanges between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region, dedicated to promoting Asia-Pacific citizenship in the United States and nurturing international youth leaders.
On the same day, U.S. Secretary of Transport Zhao Xiaolan, U.S. Congressman Mon Zhao Wen and President of the International Leadership Foundation, Dong Ji-Ling made statements.
They paid special tribute to the Asia-Pacific medical workers and volunteers on the front line of the epidemic and called on the American public to continue to adhere to preventive norms such as "social distance" to curb the spread of the epidemic.
Dalian: No new cases of coronary pneumonia diagnosed locally, 24 new cases of non-symptomatic infections - Xinhuanet
On July 25th, the Xinhua Club released a message from the city of Dalian (journalist Choi Chou-ho), and between July 24-15 and 1400 hours on July 25th, there were no new cases of coronary pneumonia diagnosed locally in Dalian city, 24 new cases of non-symptomatic infections and no new suspected cases.
Between 22 and 25 July, at 1400 hours, the city had cumulatively reported 12 cases of local diagnosis of new coronary pneumonia, all of which were treated centrally in isolation at the Sixth People ' s Hospital in Dalian City.
According to Zhao Lian, Deputy Director of the Department of Health and Health of the city of Dalian, in response to the epidemic, the city organized the presence of medical personnel from the city-wide level-III hospital in street communities, opening more than 600 sampling sites along Dalian Bay, workers ' villages, light tracks and some of the focus areas of the new Qinpu district, making every effort to promote the screening of personnel for nucleic acid, and launching nearly 2,000 medical personnel per day to test for nucleic acid.
By 1400 hours on 25 July, over 210,000 samples had been taken across the city.
10 out of 12 confirmed cases in Dalian City are employees of the World Seafood Co. Ltd.; 46 out of 54 cases of no-symptomatic infections are employees of the company and their relatives; 85 per cent of all positive cases of nucleic acid testing are accounted for by the company ' s employees and their relatives.
As a result, Dalian City decided to strengthen strict control over close contacts with all employees of Dalian Kayin World Seafood and close contacts, and to implement 14 days of centralized quarantine medical observation and at least 2 tests of nucleic acid.
At the same time, the city of Dalian decided to further expand the implementation of centralized segregated medical observers, and to implement all 14-day centralized medical observation, at least two tests of nucleic acid, for close contact with persons who test positive for nucleic acid (including cases and those who have no symptoms of infection).
At Dalian airport, Dalian railway station, 25 days ' notice that city-wide personnel who, in principle, are required to carry out non-necessary, non-necessary tests of negative nucleic acid within seven days are required; the bus bus terminal has been suspended from all lines throughout the city since 1200 hours on 25th day, with a specific recovery time to be notified.
Brazilian studies show that hydroxyl chloride is not effective for the treatment of new coronary pneumonia.
In recent days, a Brazilian study has shown that hydroxyl chloride is ineffective against new coronary pneumonia.
The study was published in New England Journal of Medicine.
Bar researchers divided 667 patients in 55 hospitals across the country into three groups, conducting clinical trials; analysing whether this would help to improve the condition of the mild and moderate patients of new coronary pneumonia, mainly by comparing the treatment effects of the use of hydroxyl chloride alone or with other antibiotics, Achirocin.
The results show that hydroxyl chloride not only has no therapeutic effect, but can have damaging side effects on the organ.
The study was carried out in conjunction with the Brazilian Clinical Institute (BCRI) and the Brazilian Critical Care Research Network (BRICNet) by various authoritative hospitals in Brazil, such as the Hospital of Einstein, the Heart Disease Hospital (HCor), the Syrian Lebanese Hospital (Hopital Sírio-Libanês).
On the 25th of local time, Brazilian President Bossonaro declared the fourth nucleic acid test negative on social platforms.
At the time of the infection, Bosenaro was on hydroxyl chloride and was active on several occasions.

On 25th, the first Red Tourism Culture Festival in Hunan 2020 and the first Red Industry Fair will open in Tianshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has grown.
However, the development of the red tourism industry also faces the dilemma of small youth groups, homogenization of tour projects and single channels of commercialization.
In particular, this year's outbreak hit the country's tourist industry with severe setbacks and red tourist attractions facing serious challenges.

A representative of the US-China Trade Conference, speaking of August.
On 25 August, Hong Kong's "South China Morning" newspaper quoted an anonymous source who reported that the head of China's trade negotiation team, Deputy Prime Minister Liu Wu and the co-leader of the US team, Trade Representative Rae Hae-chul, were expected to hold a formal meeting in August to assess both sides' compliance with the first phase of China-US trade agreement.
It has been reported that while China has significantly increased its procurement of United States agricultural products over the past few months, the volume of Chinese procurement is still some distance from the amount promised in the trade agreements due to, among other things, the new coronary virus epidemic.
Analysts say that the recent closure of each other ' s consulates, coupled with other disputes, could undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the China-United States trade agreement, which entered into force one month after its signing on 15 January, provided for a high-level trade framework group of the two parties to meet every six months.
According to sources, this meeting will be an important turning point for the parties to assess the progress of the agreement.
But he also said that if the US-China tension led to a lack of willingness to talk at this time, both sides might agree that the telephone conference between Rae Hae-chul and Liu Gang on 8 May had met the provisions of the semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since this year, relations between China and the United States have deteriorated rapidly, and disputes between the two sides include a range of issues such as the origin of the new coronary virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
President Trump, while boasting at the beginning of the year about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement, has recently changed his attitude.
At a White House press conference, he said that, although China had recently bought a record number of corn from the United States and had bought a lot of soybeans in one day, "this trade agreement is no longer as meaningful to me as it was at the time of its conclusion."
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also argued that a new round of trade negotiations was unlikely to take place due to poor US-China relations and that "trade issues have lost weight in US-China relations".
However, he revealed that China ' s trade-related units still met on 23rd to discuss a number of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "we've done our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
The Vice-President of the China-China National Trade Commission, Peng Jianning, said that maintaining the first phase of the agreement was "more important than ever" and that China had made progress this year in further opening financial markets to US companies.
The analyst from the independent research firm Plium said, "It's better to talk than to talk, even though it might just be a routine."
Xinhua Society, Beijing, 26 July, journalist Wei Yu Gon, was informed by the Ministry of Emergency Management that the National Preventive Office, together with the National Food and Material Reserve Agency, had recently again urgently transferred 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million m2 of woven cloth, 130,000 m2 of earthwork cloths and 6 types of central stocks of anti-septic materials to support flood rescue efforts.
According to the head of the Emergency Management Department, at present, the Yangtze river basin maintains high water level volatility in the middle and downstream of the Yangtze River, and the riverine flood No. 3 of 2020 was formed in the upper Yangtze, with increased local risk.
Meteorological services expect heavy rains in the middle and downstream areas of the Yangtze River in the next three days of Chongqing, Guizhou, and the situation with regard to anti-mony protection remains serious and complex.
It was reported that, since its arrival, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed integrated national fire rescue teams to pre-position specialized rescue units in priority areas of protection, participating in a total of 10364 flood rescue operations involving more than 130,000 fighters, 17778 fire trucks, 11887 boats, 37777 people in distress and more than 107,000 people in need.
Xiao Seong, Chief Representative of NASDAQ, China: It's now the best time node for Chinese companies to go to the US IPO - Economic Watch - Professional Financial News site
The economic observation network, journalist Zhang Bin, has imposed stricter regulation on China General in the United States market due to the counterfeiting of the Richmond coffee, coupled with long-term valuation pressure, stress on the United States listings, Internet access, and the recent return to Hong Kong by the Chinese generals.
And recently, Shells, Ideal Motors and others, have gone to the United States of America with a lot of enthusiasm.
Is it now the best time for Chinese businesses to go to the United States in the midst of the epidemic and China’s crisis?
" In the case of recent IPOs and the companies that are going to the US market next, IPOs are essentially not affected, but are now very well marketed, even now the best time node for Chinese companies to go to the US IPO in the last 10 years. "
The Chief Representative of the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, China District, Xiao Sheng, said at the World Summit of Leaders of Listed Companies, 2020, hosted by Snowball.
In April of this year, the SEC and the Accounting Regulatory Commission of American Public Companies (PCAOB) issued "A Statement on the Role of Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information — Discussion of the Challenges of Access to Current Information for US Listed Companies with Large Businesses in China".
The statement states that, despite the significant increase in international cooperation and coordination in recent years, problems with access to information persist in the United States regulatory sector and that both SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; in response to this document, the PCAOB website details the list of listed companies that have encountered audit barriers and their auditing institutions, with a large number of such companies listed.
In addition, in May of this year, the Senate of the United States Congress passed the Foreign Companies Accountability Bill, imposing additional disclosure requirements on foreign companies listed in the United States.
In his opinion, the crisis did not affect the appetite of investors.
"When this news came out, everyone started to wonder if it would be possible to go to the United States in the future, but later we found that these problems were not with investors, who might have asked them or even become standardized in their recent trip to the United States IPO, but they were not seen by investors as an important factor in not voting for a Chinese company.
It is recommended that you take a normal view of the current situation as much as possible.
Of course, this looks like the worst situation in the last two years, but in terms of the investor's appetite, it's not affected at all.
So the trend towards the US IPO will continue from now until the end of this year or before the United States elections. "
On 9 May this year, Kim Shanyun was officially listed in Nasdak, United States, as the first Chinese company to go to the US IPO after the outbreak.
"The Chinese company behind Kim Shanyun's listing is very confident in preparing IPOs. "
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
In the first half of the year, snowball released a report of mid-year 2020 statistics showing that there were 20 IPOs going to the United States, an increase of 17.6 per cent over the same period last year; 20 enterprises raised a total of 2.725 billion in total initial funding, an increase of over 52.4 per cent over the same period last year; and the number of IPOs in the health care sector was prominent in the first half of the year, a 100 per cent increase over the same period last year.
According to Xiang Seong, Chinese companies that went to USIPO in the first half of this year are of high quality, with strong basics and growth-oriented quality companies, and will be more favoured by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Chang Sheng continues to be optimistic about Ming Chinese companies going to the US IPO.
"In the short term, the trend towards IPOs is continuing; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices, A shares, Port shares, United States shares, and the United States shares, all of which are expected to take account of the United States general elections and Chinese-American relations as market choices and timing; in the long run, everything will return to normality, with market fluctuations being cycles, both political and economic, which will eventually return to the normal phase, and stock markets have always been precipitating. "
At the same time, "There are many uncertainties this year, but for high-quality companies, regardless of whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are strong and grow to be seen by investors, other factors are relatively minor, and investors need to invest in good Chinese companies."

People's Daily Commentator: Focusing on getting things done, building new advantages for future development – the Secretary-General of Xi Jinping's important speech at the Entrepreneurship Symposium – Xinhua Network
Xinhua News, July 25th, Beijing, July 26th, commenter, People's Journal, July 26th: Focusing on doing what's best for you, building new advantages for the future.
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation remain serious and complex, and the challenges facing our development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic stamina, building confidence and concentrating on our own business are key to addressing the various risk challenges.
At the recent Entrepreneurship Symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that, in the current external environment of increased protectionism, a depressed world economy and a shrinking global market, we must concentrate on our own efforts to maximize the advantages of the country ' s mega-markets and evolve new patterns of development based on domestic cycles, which are mutually reinforcing at both the domestic and international levels, to upgrade the supply chain of industrial chains, to boost science, technology and innovation, to accelerate the closing of key core technologies and to forge new advantages for future development.
You're smart. You're smart. You're smart.
In an external environment characterized by deep economic globalization, markets and resources have played an important role in the country's rapid development.
Now, the world under the shock of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, with more instability and uncertainty, and economic globalization is reversible and backsliding.
Preparing our economy for a long period of time to respond to changes in the external environment, and driving it to take advantage of the windfalls and distance, one of the most important aspects of which is to bring about the economic recovery of the world by making the expansion and satisfaction of domestic demand the strategic basis for development, maximizing its strengths and giving it a boost to the country ' s economic development through the prosperity of the domestic economy and the opening of the domestic cycle.
We need to be deeply aware of the fact that building a complete system of domestic demand is a matter of long-term development and long-term security in our country.
The Party's central review of the situation and the clear indication of a firm strategy to expand domestic demand are the need to respond to the impact of the epidemic, to sustain the long-term healthy development of the country's economy and to meet the growing needs of the people for a better life.
The advantage of large economies is internal circulation.
Our country has one of the most complete and largest industrial systems in the world, a strong productive capacity, a well-developed complement of more than 100 million market subjects and more than 170 million highly educated or skilled people, as well as a super-large domestic demand market of 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups, which is in the phase of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and rapid agricultural modernization, with great potential for investment demand.
Proprietary systems, co-development of various forms of ownership, distribution of labour, coexistence of forms of distribution, socialist basic economic systems such as socialist market-economy systems can stimulate the dynamism of the various types of market subjects, freeing and developing social productivity, promoting efficiency and equitable organic integration, and continuing to achieve common prosperity.
We need to firmly grasp the strategic basis for expanding domestic demand, enabling production, distribution and greater reliance on domestic markets for a virtuous circle of flows, defining strategic directions for structural supply-side reforms, and promoting a dynamic balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand at higher levels.
It is important to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, to promote innovation in science, technology and all other aspects of innovation, to accelerate the advancement of the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, health of life, new and strategic emerging industries such as new materials, to create new and more growth points and poles, and to evolve into new patterns of development based on a large domestic cycle and mutually reinforcing domestic and international cycles.
Openness leads to progress and closure is always behind.
Secretary-General Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's open doors will not be closed, but will only be larger.
Focusing on the domestic cycle is by no means a closed door, but rather a stronger and more sustainable development by harnessing the potential of domestic demand to better connect domestic and international markets, making better use of both international and domestic markets, both sources.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between the expansion of domestic demand and openness, and the smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to the construction of new patterns of openness and the more conducive it is to the formation of new advantages for participation in international cooperation and competition.
While there is now a rise in international protectionist thinking, we must stand on the right side of history by insisting on deepening reforms, expanding openness, strengthening open cooperation in science and technology, promoting an open world economy and building a community of human destinies.
The Chinese nation has experienced many hardships in its history, but it has never been crushed, but has grown stronger and stronger, growing from it.
With the strong leadership of the party centre, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the remarkable strength of the socialist system of China, its strong mobilization and strong combined strength, and the unity of the nation's entire army, we will be able to overcome all the hardships and obstacles, maintain the momentum of the country's economic and social development, fully build a small and prosperous society, and successfully launch a new journey towards the full construction of a modern socialist state!
The balance of money goes down after 90, but "retaliatory" savings?
As the balance goes down, not only did "after 90" not escape the balance, but instead started to "retaliate" the savings?
According to the Chinese Institute of New Economics, the "Breaths after 90 report" (2020 edition) issued before the time of the joint payment of the Treasure, the first half of the year, after 90 was much more inclined to save: the amount of money saved per person was nearly 40% more than in 2019.
Interestingly, after 90, it's more likely to start with a little money, with 60% of the average savings below $20...
Save the money with the balance, it's also the "after 90" way of saving the money.
The data show that 134 million of the 700 million balance users are after 90 million.
China has 174 million after-90s, which means about three out of every four "after-90s" in China are saving their money.
At present, the annualized seven-day rate of return for monetary funds, such as the balance, has fallen from over 2 per cent at the beginning of the year to around 1.5 per cent.
Even so, it doesn't affect the pace of post-90 savings.
And in the context of the "saving effect" of the balance, a number of young people who used the balance money were directly transformed into "Kimin".
Data on payment treasures show that, as of 13 July, the number of new "geese" on payment treasures had increased by more than one-fold over the month, and that more and more young people were making progress on payment treasures.
According to some analysts, the flow of funds from the balance sheet to the stock market was also an important reason for the clear decline in the IMF share in June.
The report also shows that "after 90" girls tend to save more money, on average 20% more than boys; 60% of the users holding funds on payment platforms are men, and women tend to choose more prudent ways of managing money than men.
After saving money, what's the plan after 90?
Data on payment treasures show that after 90, there is a habit of saving money, and travel is the largest user to save money.
As a result of the epidemic, many "after 90" save money to prepare for post-epidemic travel; the re-opening of cinemas also provides a new way to move from savings to consumption.

Pali said that she would officially announce the formation of this space force when she visited a military school in Salon, Provence, later.
Pali said that the space force belonged to the Air Force and had 500 troops by 2025.
She said, "The idea that space served the common good of science was gone, and now space is a place for nations to compete for global hegemony."
Pali reiterated his earlier statement that the French side had no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are not engaged in an arms race, but it is my duty to fully understand the threat we may face."
Pali repeats the surveillance of a French-Italian military satellite in 2017.
She said, "Peeping" was a Russian satellite.
The Russians deny it.
Pali said that France would soon have a small patrol satellite capable of detecting and locking in the back of those unfriendly acts.
According to the French press, the reason France sought to establish a space force was because United States President Donald Trump asked the United States Department of Defense last February to draft a bill on the establishment of the Tai Air Force.
Trump signed the Defense Authorization Act last December, authorizing the establishment of the sixth largest United States army, the Tai Air Force.
Some experts are concerned that these American initiatives have accelerated the militarization of American space and could trigger a new arms race in space.

The shared accommodation market was reported to have been heating up since March - the new medium network
The "China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020" (hereinafter referred to as "the Report" ) published by the National Information Centre for Sharing Economic Research (NCC) shows that the share-in-loan market fell by 72.1 per cent in the first five months of 2020 as compared to the impact of the epidemic.
However, the shared accommodation market has been warming since March, and the volume of market transactions, orders and reception numbers have gradually recovered.
The "Report" shows a significant decline in the volume of transactions in the shared accommodation market due, on the one hand, to a significant decline in demand for travelling accommodation under the control of the epidemic, a sharp decline in the number of orders, a 65 per cent decline in total orders over the previous five months and a 63 per cent decline in the number of customers over the same period; on the other hand, the weakness of demand has also led to a more marked decline in overnight prices, with a 16 per cent decline in average overnight prices over the previous five months.
However, in March, April, the market turnover ratio increased by 78 per cent, 199 per cent, 35 per cent, and the number of orders increased by 141 per cent, 152 per cent, 50 per cent, and the number of reception links increased by 81 per cent, 112 per cent, 28 per cent.
The report notes that the shared accommodation industry has developed well in the long term, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
In response, the Deputy Director of the Centre for the Sharing of Economic Research of the National Information Centre in Fengxia stated to the daily reporter "Workers" that shared accommodation development required stronger policy support, on the one hand by putting in place the policies that had been put in place in the previous period, on the other hand by further strengthening policy coherence and focusing on the creation of a better business environment, and on the other hand by further strengthening policy guidance and support in various areas, such as stimulating consumer demand, enriching the provision of tourism accommodation services, innovative service delivery and strengthening cooperation between government and platform enterprises.

On July 26, China's famous vascular Surgery Centre, Shanghai Longhai Hospital of the Naval Medical University, signed a contract with the Xiamen University-affiliated Xiaoshan Hospital for vascular Surgery to set up a collaboration centre to promote communication between the two sides in the field of vascular Surgery, particularly in the field of arteries.
According to the Nakayama Hospital, after formal collaboration between the vascular surgeons of the two hospitals, remote consultations will be conducted, treatment programmes will be developed with the real-time online consultations of the Changhai Hospital, training will be provided, weekly joint exchange of surgical techniques, study rooms etc., and, in complex cases, experts from the Changhai Hospital will be invited to operate in the hospital according to the patient ' s needs, thereby enabling patients from the southwest to benefit from the best medical resources available in the country if they do not leave the province.
The two hospitals will also work together on innovative surgical research, anorexic disease science and early screening.
The workshop was hosted by the Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by Nakayama Hospital, affiliated to Xiamen University, which was held in Xiamen on the day of the workshop.
During the same period, the two recognized hospitals held a signing ceremony for the collaboration centre for blood-vascular surgery and announced the formation of a joint unit to raise the level of care for angioplasty-related diseases in the south-west of Guan.
The vascular Surgery of the Shanghai Long Sea Hospital is the only vascular Surgery Institute in the army and the only clinical centre for vascular system diseases in Shanghai City, as well as the first major national vascular Surgery programme, leading the establishment of a professional committee on intra-uterine vascular science of the Chinese Association of Doctors, which is the top team with a deep-seated industry.
Professor Wong Xiaozheng, Director of Cardio Surgery, Midsan Hospital, Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
Angioplasty is the first independent vascular surgeon in Fujian province, with a long-term commitment to the treatment and treatment of anorexic and peri-vascular disease, and the construction of a provincial clinical focus in 2018 was approved.
In the treatment of anorexic diseases, in addition to mesothelioma and anorexia treatment, there is considerable experience in the treatment of aneurysm in emergencies.
" From the history of development, the breadth, difficulty and complexity of the operation of the vascular surgery at the Central Mountain Hospital attached to the University of Xiamen, we have been very successful in the region. We have therefore established a collaborating centre which, in addition to the aorta, has been able to provide in-depth medical, pedagogical and scientific cooperation in the treatment of diseases such as the lower limb artery, the carotid artery, etc. ... "
The Deputy Director of Cardiovascular Surgery at Shanghai High Hospital, Prof. Feng Wei, said...
The Nakayama Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, and the Shanghai Hospital contracted to set up the digestive internal medicine "Li Mo Shen's Hospital" in 2018.
Professor Huang Xiaozheng, head of the vascular Surgery at the Institute, in an interview with a journalist from China and China, said that the Institute ' s vascular Surgery had also been sharing its origins with the Changhai Hospital for a long time, and that the two hospitals had been formally formed as a collaborative unit to bring them together to the new steps.
He said that the Institute would regularly invite experts from Shanghai to exchange surgical techniques, study rooms, discuss difficult cases, etc., while further remote consultations were being conducted, and that a weekly remote consultation was currently planned; in addition, the Section would also select personnel for further exchange to enhance the development and development of the teaching staff.
At the meeting, journalists learned that vascular disease was the leading cause of death in China and that the artery was the main artery of the human body ' s various organs, moving from the heart to the whole body and assuming an important role.
The occurrence of an arterial disease is often accompanied by high risks, high mortality rates and the difficulty of treatment, with the widest segment of the artery having a diameter of up to 4 cm. If an vascular tumor is formed, there is a break-up, or if an intra-vascular membrane is broken into a membrane, it causes haemorrhage, which is dangerous.
In recent years, as the lifestyle of people has changed and the pace of life has increased, China has become the world ' s largest country with high blood pressure, and there has been an increase in the number of anorexic diseases. Today, with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, treatment of anortic diseases has been minimally, rapidly and efficiently developed.
The doctor can be a proper "transformation" of the bloodstream by piercing the thigh and putting it in the rack in the aorta so as to avoid the impact of an aneurysm or a break-in lacuna and achieve a good therapeutic effect, some of which require a local anesthesia.
The symposium invited more than a dozen national experts to discuss new developments in the treatment of anorexic diseases and to conduct cutting-edge technical training in the form of a conference salon and a discussion of problematic cases.
During the meeting, journalists learned that with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, the treatment of the aortic disease is now developing in a small, rapid and efficient way.

The longest high-iron tunnel in the tri-fjord zone runs through the Chinese-new network.
2020-07-26 17:34:48 Source: China News Network.
It's a construction site for the tri-firth tunnel.
I'm looking for a supply from the Sino-Congress Chamber of Commerce.
On July 26th, the Chinese Internet journalist Chongqing (journalist Han Yong) learned from China Railways Chengdu Group Ltd. that the entire 18.9-km length of the Jung Mangong Three Gorge tunnel became fully operational on that day.
It is understood that the tri-firth tunnel is not only the longest high-iron tunnel within the tri-firth bank area, but also the maximum single-clan double-line high-trail tunnel designed to reach 350 km/h per hour in the country as part of a project currently under construction.
The arrival of Jung Mangong, located in Henan, Hubei, Chongqing, the city of Chongqing, the north of Chengzhou, and Xu Langhai, the north of Chengzhou, in Chongqing, the north of Wanzhou and the north of Wanzhou, and the arrival of the ten thousand high irons, is an important part of the riverway and the Honan corridor in our "eight-and-eight-way" high-speed railway network.
Jung Mangau, the three canyons tunnel is 26 days in line.
It's on the ground.
Zheng Wanqiang started in the city of Zhengzhou, Henan Province, and built new lines of approximately 818 km in length, 350 km/hour, and approximately 184 km in Chongqing for the city of Ping Pingshan, south-west and Xiaoyang in Hubei Province and the city of Chongqing.
Of these, Chongzhou to Xiaoyang became operational early on 1 December 2019, and Chongqing is stepping up construction.
The 26-day-long, fully-wired tri-firth tunnel is a full-line control project for Jung Mangau, located on the border between Chongqing and Sooshan counties, which is approximately 18.9 km long and is buried at a maximum depth of 890 m.
The tunnel began construction in February 2017 and became fully operational on 26 July 2020.
According to the Royal Army, the director of the design of the Chinese Central Iron II Engineering Group of the Survey Design Group of China, Cheng Wangong, the Royal Army, the chief of the design of the tunnel, the three canal tunnels are located in a highly complex terrain, exposed to the risks of rock soluble, mud pouring water, soft rock mutatis mutandis, high-risk tunnels of level I, which are extremely difficult to design and build.
" In the course of the construction of the project, we have adopted special designs for over 30 types of soluble holes, using geologic, object-search and super-drive predictions, such as the design of bridges 24 metres long, crossing large soluble holes over 10 metres long and over 55 metres deep inside the tunnel, to avoid tunnel deposition. "
According to the Central Steel Tunnel Agency, the construction of the tunnel was carried out by means of a combination of decomposition, the construction of cross-clans, slurry and water, the reinforcement of the tunnel structure and the construction of sewage treatment stations, both to ensure an orderly advance of the work and to avoid damage to the water bodies of the three canyons, while successfully overcoming difficult geological conditions such as a 7-km soft rock mutation, with a maximum daily influx of 157,000 cubic metres of multi-murage water.
The completion of the entire railway line will make it important for the country ' s south-west, north-west and north-east regions to have a new easy and fast passenger main route to China, north-west and north-east, to improve the capacity and quality of the railway routes to the north-west, improve the regional road network, accelerate the development and urbanization of tourism resources along the routes, promote coordinated regional development and promote the implementation of the Western Greater Development Strategy.
Experts say immigration data is collected through the United States census for the unconstitutional distribution of seats in the House of Commons.
A number of civil rights organizations and several United States cities and counties have brought charges against the United States federal Government, claiming that the Trump presidential office's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the United States census is not feasible and unconstitutional.
The United States census will determine the distribution of seats in the House of Representatives of the United States Congress.
Sarah Brannon, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union executive lawyer, said to the American voice, "It's not gonna work."
She went on to say that Trump called for the determination of the citizenship of the persons to be surveyed in the census to be difficult and "not very reliable."
Another Civil Liberties Organization co-worker filed a lawsuit on Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
In New Jersey, some of Georgia's cities joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, joined the lawsuit on Friday.
The Chairman of the Governing Board of Arlington County, Garvey, said, "The United States Constitution requires an accurate inventory of our population every 10 years. We must take an accurate inventory of everyone living in Arlington County.
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
The Attorney-General of Alabama, Marshall, said that the executive order was a victory for the state.
He said, "The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and electoral groups of the States must be based on the number of residents residing in the States and the number of residents legally residing in them."
The United States Supreme Court last year prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship issues in the 2020 census table.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week instructing the United States Census Bureau's Business Secretary, Ross, to regulate the submission of data on the undocumented population from the census, so that the Administration would exclude these undocumented populations from the census figures of the states and thus determine whether each state would increase or reduce or maintain the number of members of the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats to the House of Representatives every 10 years, depending on demographic changes.
In Chongqing, 33 districts and districts were hit by heavy rains, and local emergency response level IV was activated.

According to monitoring by Chongqing City Hydrological Monitoring Station, from 0800 hours on 25th to 0800 hours on 26th, the area of Chongqing was hit by heavy rains in 33 districts, including Huenzhou, Yunyang, Nankawa and 16 districts.
The largest daily rainfall occurred in the village of Longshan in the town of Jinsan, Nanchuan, at 197.5 mm.
High-security flooding in four small and medium-size rivers in Yunyang County Bay due to heavy rainfall, as well as donkey streams in Jiangjin district, oil rivers in Kaiju district, and water levels are still rising.
The heavy rains also led to landslides in the village of the land commune of the Mulong district, disrupting road traffic on the village road, slipping into the tributary of the river, blocking the riverway to form a lake of Quasi, and urgently organizing a downstream mass transfer.
In response to the storm, at 1300 hours on 26 June, the Chongqing city drought-resistant command issued an early warning message on level III of the river flood and launched an emergency response level IV, requesting the districts and units concerned to increase their surveillance, mobilize emergency relief teams and supplies in a timely manner and evacuate the population in threatened areas.
In response, move forward with industrial project construction - visual headline - HUNNAN Daily News - Chinese Voice Online
Summer's Hunan, hot waves on the surface.
And the enthusiasm unleashed by the Department-wide industry project to build and promote a live viewer, built over three volts of heat, inspired by the clear direction of the industry versus the hero of the project.
The development of Hunan always depends on building projects, training industries.
In the very unusual first half of the year, under the strong central leadership of the party, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the province insisted on playing a game of chess, fighting the disease, fighting the two tough battles, and using industrial projects as a front hand game to implement the Six-Step Six.
From a 1.9 per cent drop in GDP in the quarter to a 1.3 per cent increase in GDP in the first half of the year, the difficulty of the period, the magnitude of the effort, is self-evident.
On this valuable report card, industrial construction is the key underpinning for the accelerated economic recovery of Hunan and the stabilization of development.
It's good. It's irreversible.
Industrial projects must be built in a way that is dynamic, dynamic, aggressive and responsive to change.
In the context of the current complex and serious international situation, in addition to the enormous effort to attract resources, there is a need to study the new features of the current situation in order to achieve greater regularity, scientific precision and integration into new patterns of development based on a large domestic and international cycle that is mutually reinforcing.
More attention is being paid to upgrading the infrastructure of the industry.
In the first half of the year, not only did I save a large number of heavy-weight investment projects in new and emerging industries from breaking ground, but also from hope and from the traditional advantage of industry enterprises that accelerated their placement in digital, intelligent, green industrial transformations.
The Xiyang Oscon III Science Park project has adapted existing production lines and advanced high-end print circuit smart production lines; the new site of the Changde tobacco factory in Hunan is dedicated to the intellectual transformation and the construction of modern plants, and is also a living picture of the "old tree's sprouts" . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Greater focus on fostering new business models for the development of the new economy.
The sudden emergence of the new crown epidemic, which has brought a red light to the cloud economy, has inspired the potential of the digital economy and provided a new opportunity for industrial change: in the first half of the year, I increased 12.6 per cent in the manufacturing of computers and office equipment and in the manufacturing of electronic and telecommunications equipment, 32.2 per cent in the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the limit, and 35.6 per cent in the online meal billing of catering businesses.
In the midst of the crisis, new opportunities have been created in the transformation process, and the digital industry has been actively promoted, industrial digitalized, leading to the integration of the digital economy and the real economy.
Greater focus on optimizing and stabilizing industrial chain supply chains.
Engineering machinery is the main force in Hunan industry, but two thirds of the supporting companies are out of the province and there is still room in the chain.
Strengthening the industry chain thinking project to achieve technological breakthroughs at key points in the industry chain, not only through continuous accumulation of head enterprises, but also through the subliminal nurturing of local chains to trigger chain chain chain reaction, facilitate coordinated layout of the relevant supporting industries, and accelerate the building of autonomous, secure and secure industrial chain supply chains.
We still have a good business environment in Hunan.
(b) The "shareholder" service was implemented by Xiaoyang, which did not push the business, failed the policy, solved the problem at night... In the process of recovering the damage caused by the epidemic, there were a lot of "species" that could be found to make it happen.
A mind-searching industry, nurturing industry, developing industry, solidly optimizing the business environment will win the favor of more investors.
The wind is still on the front, but the state of the wind has become the norm of building industry projects across the province to advance high-quality development.
At this critical time, it is important to learn from and follow the spirit of the series of important directives of Xi Jinping Secretary General, to respond effectively to external uncertainties with certainty in his work, and to continue to promote industrial projects, passion, sweat, and ensure the successful completion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and the full realization of the Sino-Kang society.

The overall level of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature" - a new net.

The overall level of employment and prices shows that there's a temperature in the economy.
Journalist of the Daily Economics of China Economic Network
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, our country has taken a comprehensive approach to the prevention and economic and social development of the epidemic. The situation has continued to improve, the economy has been recovering steadily, employment and price performance, which are closely related to human life, has generally stabilized, and the Chinese economy has handed over a report sheet on its economic performance with temperature.
In the first two months of the year, there was an increase in the unemployment rate of the survey.
In particular, in February, many enterprises had essentially ceased their productive activities, reduced demand for employment in enterprises, delayed or cancelled recruitment, and increased unemployment in urban surveys.
As the situation of disease prevention and control gradually improves, the entire society has been able to restore order in its productive life.
The Party ' s central centre maintains the general thrust of the medium-term job search, further strengthens the macro-policy ambivalence, strengthens employment priorities across the board, and actively promotes employment stabilization efforts.
We have stepped up our policy to stabilize jobs by giving a combination of "reduced and suspended return" policies, a phased reduction of the contributions of three social insurance units, a moratorium on the payment of social insurance contributions, an increase in the return of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises, an increase in the benefits of the policy of job training, subsidies for the inclusion of priority groups in the employment of enterprises, apprenticeship subsidies, etc.
With the implementation of stable employment policies, the demand for employment in enterprises has risen steadily, the employment situation has gradually improved, the unemployment rate in urban surveys has declined gradually, and in June it was 5.7 per cent.
The Director of the Population and Employment Statistics Division of the National Statistical Office, Zhang Yi, said that employment policies had continued to work in the second quarter, with the return of former workers who had withdrawn as a result of the epidemic, and that the urban labour force participation rate in June had risen by about 10 percentage points from February, close to last year ' s level in the same period.
According to the data, the total number of urban jobs in June was more than 19 per cent higher than in February, with most industries reaching pre-epidemiological levels; the average weekly working hours of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than in February and 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Prices are the same for thousands of families.
In January of this year, the CPI increased by 5.4 per cent on the same date, and it's been high for years.
In February, the CPI experienced a slight decline in the same increase, but it was still in Zone 5.
The CPI is high at the same rate of increase, with both pre-spring consumer demand pull factors and spring staggered and same-year base factors.
However, the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly pronounced.
In January and February, there were logistical delays throughout the country, delays in the supply of goods, increased costs of transportation of goods, and a marked increase in the price of some of the basic necessities of life, as a result of the build-up of some citizens.
In response to the disruption of the price situation caused by the outbreak, the authorities have included vital goods in emergency transport guarantees to ensure that they are transported smoothly.
A series of policy initiatives have resulted in a strong guarantee of market supply of vegetable fruit.
In response to the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of the year, the central policy of price stabilization was followed by rapid implementation in all regions, with a marked improvement in the supply of pork reserves, an orderly resumption of pig production and a gradual improvement in the order of production and distribution.
Prices of pork fell continuously from March to 10.6 per cent in May, which led to a similar increase in food prices; in June, the price of pork was slightly higher than the price of pork, owing to a slowdown in the production of raw pigs, a decline in imports and a recovery in demand for group consumption.
Seasonal changes in the prices of fresh food are evident, with an average increase of 3.4 per cent in the first half of the year.
Owing to the higher comparison base over the same period last year, the price of fresh fruit continued to decline in the same year, with an average decline of 13.3 per cent in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the population is effectively guaranteed and the economic and social situation is stable and orderly.
Market supply and demand have improved as transport logistics have gradually recovered, supply has increased everywhere.
Beginning in March, the CPI ring declined for four months in a row, with the same increase falling from 4.3 per cent in March to 2.5 per cent in June, and price levels returned to overall stability.
In the second half of the year, prices will continue to remain moderate, with moderate overall inflationary pressures, but will continue to contribute to a return to productive life in the context of the normalization of disease prevention and control.
Effectively respond to food, floods in agricultural production areas such as fruit and vegetables, natural disasters such as droughts, strengthening market regulation, and determinedly combating the destabilizing of markets, such as the accumulation of wonders and the uplifting of prices.
Ma Yun was summoned by the Indian courts?
Ali: official response from non-Ari sent - Chinese new network
Ali: Online "official response" from the non-Ali side.
In the afternoon of July 26th, a foreign media report reported that a court in New Delhi, the capital of India, had summoned UC India, the founder of Alibaba, Maun, and a dozen other executives for a former employee suit.
In response, the chairman of the Public Relations Committee in Alibaba had a humorous message in a circle of friends that UC India was following the process, but as far as Ma Yun himself knew, he said, "I don't know.
I've been looking for him all day... and I'm going to visit HHB tonight. "
Ali also confirmed to the central and new latitude clients that the previous official response from Ali, known as the UC, had been firmly committed to servicing the Indian market and protecting the welfare of local employees, and that the policy was in line with local law.
As the matter is still at trial, no further comment can be made on this issue ... "

The Heilong River has launched a special campaign to clean up and clean up a well-known hospital - the China-New Network.
In recent years, irregularities and inappropriateness in the names of some health-care institutions have led to the misdirection of the population to seek medical treatment by using the names of well-known health-care institutions without legal authorization ...
In the name of the registered medical institution in Heilongjiang province, the name of a well-known medical institution such as "college and" appeared in the name of the national credit information system and operated abroad under the name of a well-known hospital such as "college and" which disrupted the normal medical order and had a negative social impact.
At the same time, it will serve as an opportunity to conduct a variety of legal literacy campaigns to raise awareness of the responsibilities of market subjects, to defend rights and to operate in compliance with the law.
By opening up channels for reporting complaints, the public is exposed to a number of typical cases with adverse effects, which have a deterrent effect.

The script was read entirely by the Beijing Young Actors class and was rehearsed for two weeks under the leadership of the director Tang Xiao, each of whom created a novel to deepen the profile of the characters so that, after nearly 40 years, it could be re-examined and the realist drama re-emerged.
Today, the opening ceremony of the Huanan Red Tourism Culture Festival and the opening of the first Red Culture Industry Fair is held in Tianshan.
On the occasion of the opening of the Red Tourism Cultural Festival by Zhang Hongsen, Minister of Communication of the Provincial Council, Deputy Governor U Guiying.
The Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival has successfully held 16 sessions and is a well-known brand name for red tourism across the country.
The festival was co-sponsored by the Ministry of Communication of the Provincial Councils, the Department of Culture and Tourism of the Provinces and the City Council.
He said it was important to follow up on the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping to "use red resources well, build on red traditions, pass red genes well" and further catch my red tourism development, promote the revival of the Brunei market, and bring "red forces" together into a broad-based alliance to build a rich, beautiful and happy new Hunan.
The promotion of red culture, the transmission of red spirit, the stimulation of cultural consumption and the promotion of high-quality development in the Hunan Brigade will certainly play a more active role.
At the opening ceremony, the "Red Man's Man's Man's Man's Mandarin" Red Dance Invitations, "Returning the Long March, Crossing the End" two events were launched simultaneously.
During the festival, there will also be events such as the launch and signing ceremony of the industrial project, the Red Tourist Forum and the Red Education Training Seminar, the Red Wisdom Brigade Experience Fair and the sharing of new technologies, "The Same Water, Culture and the Hunan Song Invitations. "
During the opening ceremony, leaders and guests such as Zhang Hong-seng and Wu Gui Ying visited the site of the first Red Industry Fair and watched the "China Out of Mao Zedong" scene.
As an artist, communication is very important to me.
Through my art work, I try to make it clear that human beings are not separated from nature, but that everything is connected.
I went to Antarctica for the first time about 10 years, and I saw the iceberg for the first time.
I'm afraid.
My heart is beating fast, my head is dazed, trying to understand what this is in front of me.
It's just strange that a snowflake is covered in another snowflake, formed year after year.
The icebergs are formed when they break apart from the glacier or from the ice shelf.
Each iceberg has its own unique personality.
Their interaction with their surroundings and circumstances is in a clear way.
Some of the icebergs refuse to compromise and stick to the end, while others can't stand the bursting of passion.
When you look at the iceberg, it's easy to think that they're all isolated, they're separate, they're separate, they're separate, they're more like the way we humans sometimes think about ourselves.
But it's more than that.
As the iceberg melts, I breathe its ancient smell.
As the iceberg melts, it releases mineral-rich fresh water that feeds everything.
I started filming the icebergs as if I were filming the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that the icebergs existed in that way at these individual moments, but would never exist again.
When they melt, it's not death; it's not an end, it's a continuation of the path to life.
I've filmed icebergs, some of which are very young -- thousands of years old.
Some ice over 100,000 years.
The last picture I want to show you is an iceberg that I filmed on Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
It's a very rare opportunity for everyone to actually witness an iceberg roll.
So that's what it says.
You can see a boat on the left.
It's a boat about 15 feet away.
I want you to look at the shape of the iceberg, and it's deformed on the water.
Here you see it roll, the boat moves to the other side, a man standing there.
It's an average size Greenland iceberg.
It's about 120 feet high or 40 meters high.
This video was taken in real time.
Like this iceberg, they show you different aspects of your personality.
Thank you.

Qinghai Lake's Flower Sea Live Room: "Sweet" with aid for farmers - New and Middle Network
2020-07-26:43:50 Source: China News Network.
This is a picture of the promotion of the green bee product by the President of the Beijing Hyde Bee Industries Ltd., Sina (left).
Marvelism, take a picture.
On July 26th, China's new network, Qinghai Hainan called "The Flower Sea Live Room on Lake Qing" with "Sweet" aid for farmers.
Author, Hu Guilong, Pan Yu Jie
" On the shores of the summer Qinghai lake, with its golden flowers, its bees flying, high elevations, high night and day temperatures, low air pollution, strong light giving birth to the most tenacious, generous bees, high activity, high proteins, nutritional values, low sugar and low lipid characteristics... "
26 Jianhoon Zhang, Deputy Director of Industry and Information Administration, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Province, Qinghai Province, stated that
On that day, a live delivery of the "Single Splash Helping Farmer" bee product was held on the edge of Lake Qinghai, where representatives of the Chinese Bee Products Association and entrepreneurs, as well as bee farmers, came together to promote the Qing Sea-specific bee product, selling nearly 10,000 bottles of the Qinghai Plateau bee magma under the line, bringing goods to nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The map shows bee products at the bee farmer's site.
According to information received, the live feed was facilitated by a network of Beijing-based chains of bee businesses, fast hands, treasure-grabbing and other well-known domestic bee businesses, live broadcasts, electric platforms, the exchange of business + bee farmers + growers, and through online and offline channels, the ongoing distribution of the Qinghai Plateau Spring Slender Certificate to consumers is expected to yield a total of nearly $5.28 million worth of profits throughout the year.
In response, the President of the Beijing Hyde Bee Industries Ltd., Xuana, said, "It's worth it," which would increase the visibility of the green bee products, attract more consumers to know, enjoy the absence of pure natural bee products, and boost the harvest of bee farmers."
At present, the company has entered into a production cooperation strategy agreement with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industries Co. Ltd. and the Qinghai Boro Bees Corporation, which seeks to promote the growth of local bee industries in the Qinghai Sea.
It's like a bouquet on a Qinghai lake.
In the spring, roads were blocked by the need to prevent and control the epidemic, the way the bee farmers "get after the honey" was blocked, many bees died because they missed their seasons and lacked food, and their income was severely affected.
"A year after year, the humming farmers traveled long distances from Yunnan to Sichuan northwards to the northwest, and they were living in a place without a place to stay.
As businesses, we have a responsibility to help them ... "
"Honna."
"The bee is an environmental scout, and the bee in a highly contaminated area cannot survive. " The Vice-President of the Chinese Bee Products Association, Zhao Xiaochuan, introduced that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and that it plays an irreplaceable role in preserving plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase the quality of crops, especially in widely grown and poorly managed areas.
Research data show that pollination can increase the production of oiled vegetables by 15% - around 30%.
The Chinese Bee Products Association's Managing Vice-President Zhao Xiaochuan (right) introduced the Qing Sea Bee product.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits of bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves, and the bee industry has great potential for human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction, and ecological protection, which has been poorly known ... "
Zhao Xiaochuan said...
Today, the number of beekeepers is decreasing, and there are many poor households that have been unable to move beyond the year-on-year hives, opting for beeboxing as stock cooperatives.
"The State has financial support, we contact technicians to help guide, and the bee farmers lack knowledge and judgement about the market environment, and they also need the help and coordination of the Government, enterprises, industry associations... "
Zhao Xiaochuan said...
"I want you to pay more attention in the future to help the bee-keeping community, "Sina says, "Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict compliance with national standards, ensuring quality and protecting consumer rights while helping the bee farmers."
As a result of the continuing rains, since 22 July, in the middle of the village of 6 wells in the land commune of Chongqing district, there has been a break-up of the earth behind the landslides of the bunkers in the central group of the village of 6 wells, resulting in a massive slide and deformation that completely blocks the river, forming a 13-metre water level in front of the dam, with an estimated reservoir water content of approximately 550,000 cubic metres.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, Chongqing maritime authorities decided to impose temporary traffic control over the Yangtze stone plate to the waters of the beach.
According to monitoring by the meteorological and hydrological services in Chongqing, from 25 to 25, heavy rains have been widespread in the Mid-West and North-East districts of Chongqing, heavy rains in some parts of the country and heavy rains in all parts of the country.
On the evening of 26th, the Xiaojiang dam will have the highest water level, the highest level approaching the alert level.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, Chongqing Maritime Department decided to impose temporary traffic control over the Yangtze stone plate to the waters of the Zaiwan Beach ...
Following an emergency meeting between the Chongqing City Defence Office and meteorological, hydro, hydrological and other departments and units, the Chongqing City Drought Control Command decided to issue early warning information on level III of river flood and initiate emergency response level IV.
The Chongqing City Drought Control Command has requested that the districts of Chongqing, north of Shap Dam, Xiangnan, Wulong and Chongqing should pay high attention to rainwater conditions, particularly the Yangtze, Ka Mahang, Wu River and Water Changes, advance analysis, early warning, enhanced inspection values, determined evacuation of people in threatened areas, timely mobilization of emergency relief teams and supplies, rapid and efficient disaster management and avoidance of mass casualties.

Seventy-four years ago, on January 23, 1946, 28 fighters of the Viet Nam Fighting Coalition were bravely killed when they attacked the Phonehe stronghold.
The attack was won as a historic victory between the two countries in the early stages of the struggle for the national liberation revolution.
Ms. Chung stressed that the peoples of the two countries will always remember the dedication of those who have sacrificed their lives in the cause of their national liberation struggle, while stressing that the young regions of the two countries will continue to build on the heroic and strong traditions of their elders and make their due contribution to the continued development of their relations and prosperity.
Milestone crossing!
International Milan unlocked 3,000 Jail Competition - China New Network
In the early morning hours of July 26th, Beijing Time, the New and Chinese Internet client was at a milestone battle in the Yikat tradition of Iloan International.
According to the Italian media, the spot against Genoa was the 3,000th A.A.A. match for the international Milan team, and the Blue Black Army was the first team to unlock this milestone.
Since the re-establishment of the League in 1929, Milan International has been the only team that has never been absent, and the only team that has never been downgraded.
According to the Italian media, the international match between Milan and Genoa is the 3000th game of the Blue Black Army.
In this milestone battle, the international Milan resort won Genoa with three goals.
This time, Luca Kume, he's playing twice, and he's giving a ball for Sanchez.
From the beginning, the game has entered the rhythm of international Milan, and the assault finally turned into a goal in the 34th minute.
Bilage left route. Lucacu's halfway through the door.
The 82nd minute of international Milan, after the right-hand break of Moses, was passed, with the Sanchez Middle Pass, and the last time Lukakou finished two degrees of Meri, fighting against Brozović was delivered from a long distance, and Lukaku broke into the restricted area and then pushed an empty door score at 3:0.
In Milan, the international guesthouse won Genoa at 3:0, and the scores went up against Atlanta to 2, falling behind the lead sheep, Uventus 4, in a multi-challenged race, with the hope of winning the championship.
So, of the 3,000 A.A.A.s that crossed nearly 90 miles of light, Milan International won 1,489 of them, flattened 834 and lost 677 with 49.6%.
In the meantime, the team hit 5038, threw 3102, and the field hit 1.68.
The Blue Black Army won the League 18 times and never demoted.
The statement states that the drone crashed into Lebanese territory while on mission near the Blue Line on the Israeli-Lebanese border.
The statement doesn't mention the cause of the drone crash.
According to Israeli media reports, this drone may have crashed due to a malfunction.
It was reported that Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Ganz, during his visit to northern Israel that afternoon, stated that Israel would continue to take action against Syria and Lebanon in order to ensure its security interests.
Israel has long regarded Hezbollah in Lebanon as a major security threat and has accused the Iranian side of sending weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon through the Syrian land corridor, and there has been some tension near the Israeli-Lebanese border.
Israel has repeatedly carried out air strikes against targets in Syria on the grounds of attacking the organization.
The old face of the play, Concierge Dragon, plays a stun leading man, Xinhuanet.
"The Winner" by Liu Yunlong, the director of Yin Fei, Liu Yunlong, Su Qing, Liang Hua, Li Li Qun and others, landed in Guangdong Vigilance at 7:30 p.m. on July 16th.
The play tells of a Chinese Communist underground member of the Japanese fake police, Tang Fei, united with Soviet agents, assassinated the Japanese operative leader and crushed the Japanese army's amazing plot.
The winnings are based on historical adaptations, taken from Soviet military archives that have been sealed for many years.
During the Moscow defense battle, the Red Army of the Soviet Union marched in the sharp west, while the Japanese Kandong Army "North March" considered it to be a good thing and intended to be a soldier.
In order to release the enemy from danger, the Communist Republic of China and the Soviet intelligence forces have joined forces to implement the Mudanura plan.
According to this historical background, the famous screenwriter, Deng, has been grinding his head a few times.
Liu Yunlong is also the producer and lead man in winning the game.
In his play, Tang Fei was the head of the Criminal Section of the Lim River Police Department, a stun police officer with great pleasure and even a bit of a rash, and he was a member of the Communist Underground.
The head of the Lim River Security Bureau, Mr. Choi, and her leading actress in the competition, were highly appreciated by Japan's superior Fuyuan, and there was a delicate relationship between Tang Fei and his enemies.
Su Qing has tried a lot of different roles in recent years, ranging from Rui Yuen in "We were Young" to "Yan-Yan-Yun" , which impressed the audience and was recognized for acting.
This time Su-ching and Liu Yun-Long were the first partners, and the stun police chief was set up with the Maid Maid.
In addition to the two leading players, the winnings include the champions, Li Li Qun, Chan Po, Lei Han, Xin Sorority and many powerful actors, and the old drama is one of the sights of the show.
It's also known that the winnings were very well produced, and that the team was able to film the scenes about 2,000 km across Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Liaoning, 3 provinces.
In order to restore the city's landscape during the era of the North-East Sun, the team of art props worked day and night, carefully grinding every detail of the scene and the props, making the scene in the theater very good and historic.
Floods in two western governorates of Yemen resulted in 16 deaths - China New Network
Xinhua Society, Kuwait City, 26 July, news from Sana'a (journalist Nie Yunpai Wang Wei): According to local Yemeni media reports on 26 July, Al-Hoodaida and Al-Haji governorates in western Yemen have been hit by heavy rains and floods have killed at least 16 people in the last 48 hours.
It was reported that floods caused by rainfall in Hodeda province killed 13 people and that 3 people in the neighbouring province of El Hadj were killed in the floods.
In addition, dozens of houses were destroyed by flooding in the northern part of Hodeda and in the southern part of Hadj province, and parts of roads and agricultural land were damaged to varying degrees.
The military conflict, which lasted several years, caused the near collapse of Yemen’s health system.
According to United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs statistics, more than 1 million people have been infected with cholera in Yemen since 2017, with more than 2,000 deaths.
Yemeni medical institutions are concerned that continued flooding will lead to a renewed cholera epidemic.
"The Jedi Strike" is on the show, and the Battle Box is on Dream Life - Xinhuanet.
Liao William, Dong-woo, Yang Hing-hoon, Wang Yae-bong, and other leading online films, "The Jedi Strike" are officially on the show in Aichi.
The film tells the story of the fallen boxer, Venus, returning to the ring and fighting for dignity, and shows a bloodthirsty journey of dreams.
The film "Thai Box" was driven by Thailand as its main case, using Thai boxer as the starting point for the dream, and the whole story was carried out under the adaptation of traditional Chinese cultural values, be it the determination of Venus to play fake fists for his master's sake, or the efforts to re-energize his fight for dignity later with the support of friends and loved ones, which demonstrated the desire and love of men for their families and dreams in China's traditional culture.
In combination with the classic Hollywood sports film story model and the strong combination of the Chinese and Thai professional teams, the Jedi strike not only has an international effect, but also has a different audience.
At the same time, the Jedi are showing a lot of Thai boxing and training scenes, intense and hot blood.
In the video, Chang Xiaoqiang, a game designer by Dong Woo, helped the Vienas, played by Liao William, to return to the ring and take off the crown by combining the new curious high technology with the hot-blooded competition, and also showed what Zhang and Venus looked like "unlike", a true brotherhood with the same goal.
In addition, the love between Venus and Crystal is very touching, and the silent support of Venus and the firm commitment of Venus to the crystal have made the viewers see the "treekness" of Venus, adding a lot of emotions to this champion.

I've got a reporter.
On the green side, a new mix was launched, and Shanghai State funds proposed to transfer 17.5 per cent of their shares.
On July 26th, Greenfield Holdings (600606.SH) issued "an indicative announcement that state-owned shareholders are to agree to transfer a portion of the company's shares and re-cards by means of a public call to the transferees".
The announcement indicates that, in order to further deepen the reform of State-owned enterprises, optimize the restructuring of State-owned enterprises, and improve the green land equity structure, the proportion of shares to be transferred from the company held is not more than 17.5 per cent of the total stock of the Greenland stock, to be transferred by agreement between the Upper Haiti Products (Hungarian Products) Ltd. (hereinafter "Shanghai Capital") and Shanghai Towns Throws (hereinafter "Shanghai Throws") Ltd. (hereinafter "Shanghai Towns") Ltd.) through a public call to the transferees.
The value of the proposed share transfer is not less than the average arithmetic average daily weighted average price for the first 30 trading days (27 July 2020) of the indicative announcement day; and the last accounting year ' s audited net asset value per share.
At present, new strategic investors in greenfield remain open and, according to the announcement, it is estimated that the new strategic investors will have to pay about $14 billion for 17.5 per cent of the stake transferred from greenfield in this mix.
It is worth noting that after the completion of this transfer of shares, it is expected that there will still be no controlling shareholders in the Greenfield and the actual controlling person, but that the control structure may change significantly.
Since its creation, greenhold holdings have undergone a number of institutional reforms: from 1992 to 1997, they operated under purely State-owned systems in accordance with market-based rules; from 1997 to 2013, State-owned holdings were established and continuously improved; from 2013 to 2015, strategic investors were introduced into cross-stocking of State-owned and non-public capital and integrated mixed ownership; and from 2015 to date, the whole market became a public company.
The current blending scheme in Greenfield is similar to Gravity, which in December 2019 took over 15 per cent of the shares of the Glycerine (000651.SZ) with the high capital title Joo-Hing-Hing-Hing in the amount of $4,162 million, the Gretchen Group retreated to small shareholders, and completed the mix, which led to the implementation of a high-level incentive scheme, modern business management such as anarchic structure.
Shanghai, where Shanghai City is a well-owned consortium of state-owned enterprises held by the Shanghai State Council, the Chairman of Greenland Holdings and the President of the Board, Zhang Yu Liang, stated that Greenland was an important initiative to promote comprehensive reform of state-owned enterprises in accordance with the Party ' s central requirements and to accelerate the reform of State-owned enterprises in the new phase. The new approach to reform, tailored to suit local circumstances, has been fully demonstrated by introducing new strategic shareholders to listed companies, supporting enterprises in further enhancing marketization, enhancing the freedom of business management and accelerating the full release of the dynamic of reform.
Xinhua Network, the first trip across the country to travel by car.
On 25 July, at 1220 hours, the Xinhua Society (Reporter Li Ping), on 25 July, more than 200 Shanghai tourists travelling on D771 motorbikes arrived successfully in the city of Randu, Zhejiang Province. This was the first cross-provincial (district, city) tour of the country since the resumption of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism ' s team tour on 14 July.
It is located in the middle and west of the Zhejiang city of Lang Creek, where there are many attractions, such as Gossip Girl Villages, Rivers under the ground, and Chisingu Village, and during two days and a night, more than 200 Shanghai tourists will draw a glimpse of these sites.
Li Li, Deputy Managing Director of Shanghai Railway International Tourism (HIG) Ltd., said that the company, in line with the latest policy, was focusing on trans-provincial requirements and first contacted Langbrook City to carefully launch the products Shanghai to Lang Creek and Summer Hattori, which were sold out less than a week after the launch.
Aunt Sun from Shanghai said because of the epidemic, she hasn't been out this year.
"As soon as you've been at home, you've seen a team tour, you've shared the news with your friends, you've never been to Lang Creek before, and you've been looking forward to this trip." Aunt Sun said.
It is known that in September last year, Langbrook City signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Shanghai Railway International Tourism Ltd. for the High Iron Travel River project, which plans to launch 12 trips of high-speed tourism from Jiang Quan to Ran Qui within one year.
I hit myself in the face?
It's too early to get back to work in the White House.
It's too early for the White House counselors to come back to work in the States of Bite.
On July 23, local time, 4 million cases of new coronary pneumonia were diagnosed in the United States, representing 30 per cent of global cases.
For months, US President Trump has repeatedly asked the states to resume their studies until recently, when he changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear a mask in public, while his advisors called the state governments "bite back a bite" and said they were premature.
In a press conference on 22 February, the White House presidential adviser, Karen Conway, stated that some state governments had failed to comply with the criteria for resumption of work and had reopened the bar prematurely.
Conway also mentioned earlier rumours that the President had "absolute authority" to decide the state's return to work.
"The President is a federalist who believes in state autonomy. "
She argued for Trump.
However, the rumours in Conway were made by Trump himself at the White House outbreak briefing on April 13th.
This self-punishment was mocked by the Internet as "rew history."
Karen Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump called the Governor of Michigan Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on a stoppage.
Trump wants to get back to work so he can hold a rally.
It's not the first time Karen Conway's been in dispute.
On April 15, Conway, in an interview with Fox News, said: "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, my friends!"
She seems to have understood "19" as a version number that the netizens are crazy about: reading newspapers without common sense!
Recently, we have seen the impact of cyberattacks on the commercial world.
The data leaks from companies like Morgan Chase, Yahoo, Jitbao and Taggets have led to hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions of dollars in losses.
One more attack like this, the world economy will collapse.
It's not safe in the public domain.
From 2012 to 2014, the U.S. Personnel Management Office experienced a very serious data leak.
Security clearances and fingerprints were stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
You may have heard that some government-funded hackers, trying to use stolen data to influence election results in some countries.
The most recent two were a large-scale theft of data by the German Bundestag, and an e-mail theft by the National Democratic Council of the United States.
Cyberthreats have affected our democratic process.
And there's a growing trend.
The more computer technology is developed, the more vulnerable the means we use to protect the data.
In particular, a new computer technology called quantum computers, which uses natural microparticles to significantly increase computer capacity.
It's so powerful that it can decipher many of the encryption systems we use today.
So are we hopeless?
Shouldn't we start packing electronic survival equipment to meet the coming end of the data?
I don't think it's that far.
Quantum computers are just in the lab, and it's gonna take years to actually operate.
More importantly, there have been many major breakthroughs in encryption.
For me, this is a very exciting time in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago, I learned that we unlocked new skills to create quantum effects that did not exist in nature.
The idea of using the basic laws of physics to advance the development of encryption technology is exciting for me.
Today, some of the selected companies and laboratories, including mine, have advanced this technology to the stage of practical application.
That's right.
We're going to use quantum against quantum.
How do we do that?
First of all, let's get a quick look at the encrypted world.
You need a briefcase, you have some important documents to give to your good friend James Bond, lock it up and keep it safe.
Because these materials are top secret, we're going to use a super advanced briefcase.
It's equipped with a special password lock, and once it's locked, it converts the contents of the file into random numbers.
So you just put the files in, lock them, and this time the files have been converted to random numbers, and you give this briefcase to James.
When the briefcase isn't delivered, you call him and tell him the code.
Once he's got the briefcase, entered the code, and the document was deciphered, it was perfect, you managed to deliver a encrypted message to James Bond.
One interesting example, but it's a three-point focus on encryption.
Passwords -- we call them encryption keys.
You can imagine it as a code.
The phone that told James the code.
We call it key transmission.
This ensures that the key is safely delivered to the designated location.
And the locks used to encrypt and declassify the files.
We call it the encryption algorithm.
Through the key, it converts the contents of the document to random numbers.
A good algorithm can do this, and it's hard to break the password without the key.
The significance of algorithms is that if someone gets a briefcase, opens it, doesn't have a key, doesn't know the encryption algorithm, they can't read the contents of the document.
It's just random numbers.
Most of the security systems rely on secure key transmission, passing the key to the right place.
However, the rapidly growing capacity for computing jeopardizes many of the key transmissions that we currently use.
By way of example, we're now applying a very extensive system -- RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it took about 4 trillion years to break a 426-bit RSA key.
And in 1994, 17 years later, the code was broken.
As the computer becomes more robust, so do the passwords we need.
Now we often use 2048 or 4096 codes.
As you can see, the battle between the cryptographers and the conflits is ongoing, and they all want to beat each other.
In the next 10 to 15 years, the arrival of quantum computers will quickly decipher complex mathematical algorithms that form the basis of the encryption systems we use today.
In fact, Quantum computers will turn our safe castle into a card house that's a touchdown.
We're trying to protect our castle.
In recent years, there have been a number of research institutions working on how to use quantum effects to enhance encryption.
People have made some exciting breakthroughs.
Remember the three priorities of encryption: quality key, secure key transfer and strong algorithms.
However, advances in science and engineering have jeopardized two of these priorities.
It's the key that comes first.
Random numbers are the basis for the key.
But by today, they're not really random anymore.
At present, we generate secret keys, based on random digital frequencies, generated by software, which we call false random numbers.
Programmatic or mathematically generated numbers, there's always some, maybe not so obvious patterns in it.
The lower the randomness of these numbers, or in terms of terminology, the lower they contain, the easier they are to predict.
Recently, some casinos have been attacked in creative ways.
They shoot the tiger for a while, and then they analyze it.
Cybercriminals use reverse engineering to create a fake random digital generator behind the drive.
So they have a big chance of predicting the turn of the wheel, making a lot of money.
The key is also not safe.
Having a real random digital generator is important for generating a secure password.
For years, researchers have been trying to create real random digital generators.
But most designs are either not random enough, not fast enough, or difficult to reuse.
But the world of quantum is really random.
It's very important to take advantage of this real randomness.
A device capable of measuring quantum effects can produce a very fast flow of random numbers over and over time.
There's no possibility of casino crime.
Several universities and companies from around the world are concentrating on making real random digital generators.
In my company, our quantum random digital generator was born in an optical table 2 metres long and 1 metre wide.
Then we narrow it down to a box size.
So far, we can put it on a PCI card and stick it on an ordinary computer.
It's the fastest, really random digital generator in the world.
By measuring quantum effects, it produces 1 billion random numbers per second.
Today has been widely used around the world to enhance the security of cloud service providers, banks and government agencies.
But even with a real random digital generator, we're facing the second major cyber security threat: the security transmission of the key.
The current key transfer technology is unable to counter quantum computers.
And the quantum solution to this problem is called quantum secret key distribution, short QKD, which uses the intuitive properties underlying quantum mechanics.
Observing microparticle behavior changes the particle.
I'll give you an example.
Let's think about it again. Give James Bond the code.
But this time, we don't call him, and we use quantum effect to carry this code with a bunch of lasers and pass it through normal fibre-optics to James.
Let's assume that Dr. Nobbs wants the code.
Fortunately, in trying to intercept this quantum secret key, Dr. Nord will leave electronic fingerprints, which you and James can see.
That's how the intercepted key is disabled.
And the key left behind can provide a powerful protection for the data.
Because this safety mechanism is based on physics fundamentals, quantum computers, or any supercomputer in the future, it's impossible to crack it.
My team and I are working with many of the top universities and the defense department to improve this exciting technology and develop the next generation of safety products.
The Internet fortifies the advent of a highly interconnected era, with 25-30 billion devices expected to be connected to the Internet by 2020.
If our society is to function properly in the world of the Internet, then trust in these interconnected systems is vital.
We believe that quantum technology will be very important in building this trust, and it will ensure that we fully enjoy these wonderful innovations, the innovations that will enrich our lives.
Thank you.

The 3-year-old kid was hit in the playground.
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Rule of Law Journal.
The playground's been smashed. The kids get paid and then they file a lawsuit against the school.
□ Correspondent of this newspaper, Zhao Yifan
Three-year-old Von was accidentally hit in the head by a softball team when he was playing in a university playground.
After Chen's compensation, Mr. Yuen's father, as his legal representative, brought the school before the court, asking for an apology for the school in which the place of play was located, and paid medical expenses, moral damages, etc., for a total of $20,000.
In recent days, the People ' s Court of Haidian District of Beijing, after considering the case, held that the school had set up a safety net on the playground at the time of the incident, that it had done its proper safety and security duty and that Chen had paid compensation, and that the plaintiff ' s application had been dismissed.
Mr. Wen complained that during the summer of 2019, he was playing in the school playground with little Man, while the softball team was training in the playground.
In order to avoid the risks involved, Mr. Wen and many other small friends and parents are operating in the safe areas designated by the softball team.
But after that, the softball team player Chen left during the pitch, causing the softball to fly across the fence to the above safe area and hit the back of Man's head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Wen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with a head wound.
In Mr. Wen ' s view, the school field facilities did not meet the relevant safety requirements and did not effectively manage the team and associated facilities.
The school ' s negligence led to the above-mentioned incident, causing great physical and psychological suffering and causing greater suffering to the family, for which the school is legally responsible.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up a safety net on the playground and posted regulations, training notices, informing that access to the playground must be safe from the training site and alerting itself to safety, and that the plaintiff could not prove that the school had "unsatisfactory security obligations", and therefore did not accept compensation.
The court concluded that the university in question was open to the public free of charge and that while the school had an obligation to ensure safety and security in the management of the playground, such a duty of security only met the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school had set up a safety net on the playground and had fulfilled its proper duty of safety and security, and Chen had also paid Siu Man damages of over $2,000 in accordance with the earlier compensation agreement. The parties had agreed to a one-time settlement of the dispute.
After the incident, the minor parents again claimed school compensation, and the court ruled against all the plaintiffs ' claims.
Neither of the parties appealed the sentence, which is now in force.
According to article 37 of our Tort Liability Act, schools, as managers of public places, have a duty of security; in cases where the actions of a third person cause harm to others, a third person is liable for tort, and a public administrator who fails to meet the obligation of security shall be subject to additional liability.
The judge stated that since it was most likely, as the administrator of a public place, to have an understanding of the actual situation in the place as a whole, to foresee possible dangers and damage, and thus to take the necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of the loss or to mitigate the extent of the damage, and to avoid and mitigate the lowest cost of the damage, the law provided for the corresponding obligation to guarantee the performance of social activities.
In the present case, the duty to ensure the safety and security of the school should be compatible with the social activities it engages in, in particular, the obligation to adopt basic security measures and to inform about hidden risks in the playground, which is open to the public free of charge.
In judicial practice, too, it would be inappropriate to impose excessive safety and security obligations on public officials.
If the school has adopted a protective net and has complied with the obligation to inform, it may be held that the school was free of fault and should not be held legally liable.
In addition, in the case of violations by third persons, even if the administrator of a public place, such as a school, fails to meet the duty of safety and security, his liability is additional to that of damages and, under the recently promulgated Civil Code, the administrator may recover from a third person after assuming additional liability.
Therefore, in such an incident, the victim should not extend the scope of the claim after having received compensation from the direct infringer.
Today I want to show you the way we make things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be able to assemble themselves, replicate and repair themselves.
So I'm going to show you what I think is the current state of manufacturing, and then we're going to compare it to some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscraper buildings -- two and a half years, 500,000 to millions of parts, very complex, using new technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space -- five years, 2.5 million parts.
But on the other hand, if we look at the natural system, we have two million types of protein that can fold in ten thousand seconds, and we can copy DNA with three billion bases in about an hour.
That's the complexity of our natural systems, but they're very efficient, more efficient than anything we build, more complicated than anything we can build.
They're more efficient in terms of energy.
They rarely make mistakes.
They can fix themselves and live long.
There's something really interesting about the natural system.
If we can convert it into our built environment, then the way we build things will have great potential.
I think the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all the complexity of what we're going to build -- our buildings and machines.
We need to decode them into simple sequences -- basically the DNA of our buildings.
And then we need programmed parts that can accept this sequence and that can be folded or recreated.
We need some energy to activate, so that we can fold these parts in accordance with the procedure.
We need some kind of redundancies to make sure we're building what we want.
So I'm going to show you some of the projects that my colleagues and I are working on to make this self-assembly a future.
The first two projects are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale reconstructible robots -- 8 feet, 12 feet long protein.
They're embedded in electromechanical devices, sensors.
You need to decode the way you want to fold, and you need to decode it into a series of angles -- minus 120 degrees, minus 120 degrees, minus 0 degrees, minus 120 degrees, minus 120 degrees, minus 120 degrees -- something of this kind; a series of angles, or a shift, and you can pass this sequence by wire.
Each unit gets its own message -- negative 120. It rotates, checks if it rotates, and then passes the sequence to its neighbors.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers, designers working on this project.
I think this project really reveals: is it really possible to expand?
I mean, it cost thousands of dollars a lot of people to make this eight-foot robot.
Can we really expand it? Can we really embed robots in every part?
The next question is to look at passiveness, or passively try to make reorganization programmed.
But it's a step further, and it's trying to make a real calculation.
Basically embedded in the basic construction module of most calculations, the digital logic door, directly into each part.
It's with Fremen.
Each door used for calculation has one quadruple, two input quadruple.
One of them is input from the user, just like you're building bricks.
The other is the entry of a brick that was put before coming.
Then it gives 3-D space output.
Which means users build bricks the way they want them to.
It's calculated on the basis of what you've done and your instructions.
Now it's moving in three-dimensional space -- up or down.
Look on the left. [1,1] The input is equal to zero output, which means down.
On the right, the input in [0,0] is an output, indicating upwards.
So this really means that our structure now contains the blueprints we want to build.
So the information about what you want to build is all embedded in it.
It means we have some kind of self-replicating.
In this case, I call it self-directed reproduction, because your structure contains precise blueprints.
If there's a mistake, you can replace a part.
All the local information is embedded in it, telling you how to fix it.
So you have something to climb, you can read it and one by one output.
It's directly embedded; no external command input.
The last project I'm going to show is called the Paranoia Chain, which is probably the most exciting example of the passive self-assembly system we're seeing right now.
It's reconstructible and programmed to make it a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a chain of elements.
Each element is identical, and they're biased.
Each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
If you're going to assemble the chain, you need to plan for it.
Tell each unit to turn left or right.
When you shake this chain, it folds up and programming any structure that you code for it -- so in this case, a spiral, fire, two connected cubes.
Basically you can program in three-dimensional space -- or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- and this chain is completely passive.
What kind of future does this augur well for us?
I think it tells us these possibilities for self-assembly, self-replication and self-repair in our physical structures, our buildings and our machines.
There's new programming in these parts.
From which you can get a new possibility of calculation.
We'll have room to calculate.
Imagine our buildings, bridges, machines, all the bricks can actually be calculated.
What amazing parallel and distributed computing capabilities and new design possibilities.
It's an exciting potential.
I think these projects that I'm showing you are just a small step forward, if we make these new technologies for a new self-assembly world.
Thank you.

With epidemic control normality, people's enthusiasm for physical fitness rises.
With the gradual liberalization of trans-provincial tourism, the tourism market is about to recover.
Fujian province resumed its trans-provincial tourism business from 21 July, and the first weekend after opening, the gate, which was a popular tourist destination, reached its peak.
As a hot tourist destination city, there are a lot of tourists on weekends who travel to Xiamen.
The Xiamen railway station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer, while the airport is dominated by students, tourists and family visits.
The tourist market has been warming up, with 440 flights per day at Xiamen Airport in July, and domestic flights have returned to 80 per cent of pre-epidemiology flights.
Airlines encrypt the air speed lines of major cities like Xiamen, Beijing, Kunming, and Xian to take over the recovering tourism market.
At present, the Xiamens travel agencies are on-line with a series of summer-time inter-provincial products whose team travels are dominated by outdoor spots.
In the case of railway stations, the peak of summer passenger traffic at the airport, the deployment of additional personnel in the area where people can gather, such as on-call counters, security corridors, etc., and the optimal upgrading of the eight-line health code by Fujian, the sharing and mutual recognition of health data with 31 provinces and the promotion of an orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Can Liu Dehua-Yo Qing-Yun be able to "open" a new spark - Xinhuanet?
The bomb disposal specialist 2 announced recently that it would be shown on December 24th as the first film to be scheduled for her age.
The second one is still the director, Lau Devereaux and starring in a whole new story.
The addition of the second nuclear bomb element has also made the challenge for the bomb-detonator even more difficult, and the warning of a few spectacular footages that have been stunned, a huge explosion of mushroom clouds, an airport that has been engulfed by the fire, and the scene is quite shocking.
Three years ago, the bomb-breaking expert, made by the original teamman, was the winner of the five-year-old boxing champion and seven nominations for the Hong Kong Film and Image Award, and Qiulytong X-Lu Dewar became the golden partner of the audience.
And this bomb-detonator 2 is again looking forward to a new spark in the Ace Group.
The Dismantling Specialist 2 tells a whole new story: the former Bomb Dismantling Specialist, Pan Mei Feng, fainted at the scene of the explosion and was classified as a suspect by the police.
In order to find out the truth, he had to ask for help from a friend of the bomb demolition expert, Dong Chau Wen.
The inspector who was anxious to solve the case, along with Pan's ex-girlfriend, Pon-Ling, was also involved.
He's still an expert in bomb demolition, but he can sense the complexity of Lau's new role in a pre-arranged scenario: he broke a leg, put on a leg, was hunted by Liu Qingyun, who was also an expert in bomb demolition, and was then directed by his ex-girlfriend, Nie.
What's the relationship between the three, what Lau Dewey did at the Honolulu Hotel, what was involved in the case, what was the twist of his career as a bomb demolition expert, and the mystery of which he was curious.
It is understood that the film's main scenes are a field view of Hong Kong's world landmark architecture, combined with the top special effects production team, which is a shocking visual shock.

On July 26th, China-New Network combined Russian satellite network reports, July 26 is Russian Navy Day, where the main parade to celebrate Navy Day is held in St. Petersburg and Karangstad.
The Russian President, Putin, the Supreme Commander of the Russian Armed Forces, arrived at the celebration in Kalangsta, where 15 ships and submarines were inspected.
On July 28, 2019, local time, a great military parade was held in St. Petersburg, Russia.
It was reported that Putin had congratulated the Navy officers and officers on Navy Day and had sailed by boat from the Gulf of Finland next to the ship that was about to join the naval parade, and then inspected the troops at the subjective altar.
Putin states that the Russian naval fleet is equipped with state-of-the-art ships and special equipment, and that the level of equipment is constantly rising.
Putin said on the Russian Navy Day parade: "The Russian naval fleet has high-precision weapons, strategic dive cruisers and multi-purpose submarines, aircraft such as the latest aircraft, unique weapons and special equipment."
On June 24th, local time, Russia commemorated the seventy-fifth anniversary of the victory of the Patriotic War in a military parade.
He also said that the Russian naval fleet would gain a unique advantage by digitizing and effectively defending itself.
It was reported that the main naval parade to celebrate the Russian Navy Day was held in St. Petersburg and Karangstad, with the participation of 46 ships, including the frigate, Admiral Kassatov, the large anti-submarine, and the large landing ships, small missile ships, frigates, submarines, etc.
Among them, a series of ships conducted a static display near the Winter Palace Bridge in St. Petersburg, the most striking of which was the cloned Russian first battleship, the Boltava, at the beginning of the 18th century.
In order to avoid the spread of the new coronary virus, only local residents and special guests will be able to enter Karangstad during this year's naval parade.
The last Sunday of July of every year is Russian Navy Day.
Founder of the Beijing Philharmonic Choir, Yang Hong, passed away and was 86 years old - Middle New Network
On 26 July, the Beijing Philharmonic, the founder of the Beijing Philharmonic, famous Chinese commanders, music educators, life-long academic member of the Central Academy of Music, and professor Yang Hong, died on 26 July 2020 at 13.55 p.m. in Beijing, where he was 86 years old.
Photo from the Beijing Philharmonic Network.
Yang Hong was born in 1934, from Jiang Sunanjing, in love with music since childhood.
In 1951, the Nanjing People's Radio Choir was in charge, and in the autumn of 1951, he was admitted to the Shanghai East Division of Music, learning from Professor Jang-in and German commander Hizmann, learning from the former Soviet expert Alzamanov and rewrite.
He was taught at the Faculty of Music of the Beijing School of Arts Teachers in 1958 and transferred to the Department of Composing of the Central School of Music in 1973.
Yang Hong founded the Beijing Philharmonic in 1983.
For more than 30 years, he has led this choir around the world for the purpose of love and dedication and won dozens of prizes in important national and international competitions.
Commanding the performances of more than 30 groups, as well as a number of symphony concerts and choirs, the Central National Song and Dance Group, the Orient Song and the Shanghai Choir.
The books are "Song training," "Song training", "two songs writing", "Children's Song Collection" and "The Sound Level Layout of the Orchestra", and translated into "The Singer Method" and "The Voice of Debosi".
Do you know how many blooming plants there are?
There are 250,000 -- at least we know so much -- 250 million flowering plants.
And flowers are a problem.
It's really hard to grow plants.
It takes a lot of experience and a lot of resources.
Why is it bothering you?
Of course, the answer is, like many other things in the world, sex.
I know what's in your head when you look at these pictures.
The reason why sexual reproduction is so important -- there are many other ways in which plants can reproduce.
It can be in the form of branches; it can breed the same sex; it can pollination.
But they do need to transmit their genes and mix them with other genes so they can eco-environment.
That's how evolution works.
Now the way the plant sends this message is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every family should have a scanning electron microscope that can see this.
How many blooming plants have many different kinds of pollen.
It's actually quite useful for forensics and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes us to get pollen hot comes from plants that use the wind to spread pollen.
Because most of them have been abandoned, hoping that the reproductive cells contained in pollen, male reproductive cells, will happen to fall on another flower.
All the grass, which means all the grain, and most of the trees spread pollen through the wind.
But most species actually use insects to do this process, and it's smarter in a way, because it doesn't take too much pollen.
Insects and other species can carry pollen, move pollen directly where it is needed.
Obviously, we've noticed the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship, whether birds or bees, and they get a reward, usually for nectar.
Sometimes this symbiotic relationship can lead to amazing adaptive changes -- red skirt moths are a beautiful adaptive change.
Plants also have harvests, and Tianxai spread pollen elsewhere.
Plants evolve, create landing runways everywhere, and bees may be lost in it.
Many plants have some that look like other insect markers.
These are lilies' pollen capsules, very clever, so when the unknowing insect falls on them, the pollen bag turns over, with a lot of pollen on its back, so that it can follow the insects to other plants.
There's an orchid that looks like having a jaw, and in a way, it does; it forces insects to climb over, put pollen on, and bring pollen somewhere else.
Orchids: At least 20,000 orchids -- a variety of amazing things.
They have all kinds of tricks.
They have to try and attract pollinators to help them complete this process.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it was studied by Darwin and gave an amazing prediction when he saw the orchid.
And basically what insects have to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it stabs the mouth in the middle of it and knows the nectar down to get the nectar.
Darwin said, "Look at this flower, "I guess something has evolved with it."
No doubt, it's an insect.
I mean, usually it's all rolled up, but it stretches straight and looks like it.
Now, imagine if nectar is so valuable that it's expensive for plants to produce and attract many pollinators, then, as in human sex, people may start to cheat each other.
They might say, "I've got some nectar. You want to get some?"
It's a plant.
These plants are loveable by insects in South Africa, and they have evolved long mouthpieces to get the nectar at the bottom.
It's a copycat.
This plant is imitating the former plant.
There's a fly with a long mouth, and it doesn't get any nectar from the imposter, because the impostor doesn't give it any nectar.
So not only did the fly not get nectar from a fake plant, but -- if you look very closely at the top of your head, you'll see that there's some pollen that will spread to other plants, if no botanist comes and glues it to a blue card.
This lies spread throughout the plant kingdom.
These flowers with black spots: they may look like black spots to us, but I tell you, for the male insects of the right species, they look like two very, very sexy females.
When an insect arrives and lands on it, it immerses itself in pollen, which, of course, will be taken to other plants, and if you look at the image of the scanning electron microscope that every family should have, you can see actually some patterns there, three-dimensional patterns.
It even makes insects feel comfortable, and it looks good.
These electron microscope images -- this is an orchid disguised as an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colours and different textures for our eyes, and insects may sense very, very different textures.
This orchid evolves to imitate the metallic light surfaces that some beetles see on their bodies.
Under the scanning electron microscope, you can see this surface -- it's very different from the other surfaces we've seen.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even if we look like an insect.
I mean, I think it looks like some kind of flying animal or beast.
It's a wonderful and magical thing.
It's called the Black Rock.
I think it's sly sometimes.
For the type of bee, it looks like another very aggressive bee, and it'll fly over and hit it many times with its head, try to drive it away, of course, and it'll put pollen on it.
The other thing it does is this plant mimics another orchid rich in food that insects love.
But there's nothing.
So it's cheating on two levels -- incredible.
We see Elan, the smelly part.
I actually smelled it before.
These flowers don't really have to be so beautiful.
They bring out wonderful fragrances and attract any interested insects.
This flower doesn't smell good.
This flower actually smells really bad. Again, this is evolution, and it looks like rotting meat.
So the fly likes it.
Flies fly in and pollinate them.
This is the white star taro, also known as the dead horse taro.
I don't know what a dead horse smells like, but this flower may smell very much like it.
It's horrible.
The green fly can't help it.
Fly into it, fly all the way into it.
They lay eggs on them, and they think it's a good piece of rotting meat, and they don't realize that there's no eggs here, and they're gonna die here, but this plant will benefit, because the hard hair is loose, the flies are gone, pollination goes to another flower -- it's amazing.
This is the taro plant, the Euromeat, the Erome of Bite, known in this country as the Agegrass.
I shot this last week at Dosette.
This guy's heating up about 15 degrees above the ambient temperature -- incredible.
If you look inside it, behind the meat ears is something a bit like a dam, and flies are attracted to heat -- it's a boiling volatile chemical, little worm -- and they're trapped under this container.
They drink sweet nectar and then they get a little sticky.
At night, they're covered with pollen, sprayed down by them, and then the hard hair we see up there is gone to make it possible for these little worms to escape -- it's incredible.
If you think it's incredible, this one's my favorite.
It's a green velvet.
People from Brazil should know about this plant.
It's the most amazing thing.
It's orange and it's about a foot long.
It has the ability, as far as I know, of no other plant, and when it blooms -- it's the boar in the middle -- for about two days, it produces some sort of metabolic change, some like mammals.
It doesn't have starch, it's plant food, it's got something very brown fat that burns it at the speed of burning fat, it's metabolic, it's about a cat.
By weight ratio, it's twice the energy output of hummingbirds -- absolutely amazing.
It's done something unusual.
Not only will it rise to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Fahrenheit for two days, but it will keep the temperature constant.
There's a temperature-regulating mechanism for keeping the temperature constant.
Why did you do that? I heard you ask.
Now you don't know that some beetles like mating at this temperature.
They're in. They're covered in pollen.
Plants fill them with pollen, let them leave and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing.
Now we think most pollinators are insects, but actually in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
Many tropical flowers are red, because butterflies and birds are similar to us, and we think that it's very good to see red.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue, see this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they see all kinds of dark UV.
There's some color behind this.
"If we can see those colors aren't good," I hear you asking.
Yes, we can see.
So what do insects see?
Last week I took pictures of these desert lilies, half-day flowers, in Dosset.
As we can see, these are little yellow flowers, all over the place.
It looks like this in visible light.
If it looks that way to remove the red.
Most bees don't feel red.
And then I put the UV filter in front of my camera and exposed it at a certain UV frequency for a long time, and I got this picture.
It's like a real magic target.
Now we don't know what the bees really see, when I call it red, you know what I'm looking at.
We can't know what's going on here, whether it's an insect or another human brain.
But the contrast looks like it.
This is another small flower -- located in different UV frequency zones, different filters to match different pollinators.
It looks like this.
In order to avoid the idea that all yellow flowers have this attribute -- there was no damage to the flowers during the filming process; just stick it on the tripod, not take it off -- under the ultraviolet light, look at this.
It's the basis for sunscreen, because sunscreen works by absorbing ultraviolet light.
So maybe the chemical is useful.
Finally, it's the smell of a night that Bjorn Rorslett sent to me in Norway -- an amazing hidden pattern.
I like the way it's hidden.
These pictures were taken with ultraviolet filters, the primary use of which was astronomers used to film Venus -- actually the clouds on Venus.
This is the main use of this filter.
Of course, Venus is the god of love and procreation, and that's the word of flowers.
And just as the flowers have spent so much energy trying to attract pollinators to their invitations, they have somehow succeeded in convincing us that there is a wealth of content in it, and that when we are born and die, we send flowers to each other, especially at weddings, when you think about it, at this moment the genetic matter moves from an organism to another.
Thank you very much.

On 26 July, the Qingqing City Development and Reform Committee of Qing (journalist Liu Xian) released a message stating that the city had, to date, rearrested 4404 fishermen, or 42.54 per cent of all fishermen.
In an interview with a Chinese news reporter, 53-year-old Li Dynasty said that his grandfather had been fishing in Long Creek and had been fishing with his father since he was 11 years old, shaking boats, walking along the Dragon Creek, going up to Chongqing Ping, going down to Longevity, leaving home for 10 and a half days each time to support his family.
Since 1997, however, environmental pollution has increased as the rural population has gradually moved towards the town, with a growing number of residents in the town.
Paper mills, chemical plants, farms, and contamination of river water were built along the Long Creek River.
By 2007, in 2008, the Dragon Creek turned into a stinking ditch.
"The catch is black, and it's black when it's cut. "
Li Dynasty said it's getting harder and harder to fish when the river's contaminated.
Local efforts have begun to combat the pollution of the Dragon Creek, including drifting, river cruises, water resource pipelines, etc.
Li Dynasty is also reproducing from fishermen and is a member of the river patrol to protect aquatic resources.
As of 1 January 2020, a total ban on fishing has been imposed on the Aquatic Biological Reserve of Chongqing City and the associated waters of the main city.
According to data from the Chongqing Municipal Development Reform Commission, the city of Chongqing has, to date, a cumulative total of 34.03 fishing vessels and 4643 fishing vessels, representing 63.3 per cent and 86.3 per cent of the three-year total, respectively.
4404 fishermen, or 42.54 per cent of all fishermen, have been re-arrested.
Of the 4404 re-arrested, 4267 were employed, representing 96.89 per cent of the re-arrested fishermen.
Old-age insurance coverage covers 2691 persons, representing 61.10 per cent of re-fishers.
As a next step, Chongqing City will conduct intensive and intensive rehabilitation operations, accelerate the clean-up of the Yangtze River Line project, complete a new round of screening and treatment of river drains, essentially complete the clean-up of the "triphosphorus" (phosphorous mines, phosphorus phosphorus and phosphorus gypsum reservoirs), promote the clean-up of small hydropower, promote the reforestation of both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the illegal marinas in the Yangtze River, and conduct special clean-up operations in the Yangtze River basin.
Increased Israeli control of recurrent outbreaks - new and emerging networks
2020-07-26 04:56:44 Source: Sunday newspaper.
Israel has intensified its efforts to prevent and control the recurrence of the epidemic.
In the early days of the new coronary pneumonia outbreak, Israeli control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of anti-control measures and the recent marked increase in the number of new coronary pneumonia diagnosed in Israel, the Israeli Government has taken urgent measures on several occasions to strengthen the control of the epidemic.
On 28 February, the first case of new coronary pneumonia was diagnosed on the mainland of Israel in order to quickly take steps to close all entry/exit points, suspend non-essential trades, change schools to online instruction, restrict public transport and non-essential social activities, block cities where the epidemic is serious, and jointly maintain control initiatives by the military and police.
This series of measures quickly yielded positive results and, by mid-May, a single day of new cases of coronary pneumonia diagnosed in Israel had fallen to a single-digit level.
With the outbreak under control, Israeli anti-control measures have been completely lifted, and the number of new diagnoses of pneumonia has gradually rebounded since June.
The spread of the epidemic is accelerating, especially after July.
In recent days, Israel had more than 1,500 new cases per day for 8 days, and as of 25 July, 916 new cases had been recorded on that date.
As at 25 July, there were 59,745 confirmed cases in Israel, resulting in 448 deaths.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli Government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the control of the epidemic.
On 6 July, following the diagnosis of 30,000 cases, the Israeli Government closed the gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs, etc., and introduced a policy of restricting public transport to a maximum of 20 passengers per bus.
On 17th, the Government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of the "Segregation City" on weekends, providing for the implementation of the "Stamp City" between 5 p.m. and 5 p.m. every Friday.
During this period, the population may go out, but the shops, shopping malls, hairdressers, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, galleries, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while essential services such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, meetings of 10 or more persons, gyms, studios, etc. will be closed, restaurants and cafés will be closed, and take-out services will only be permitted on all dates and times.
At the same time, the Israeli population has not paid enough attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and has failed to work with the Government to combat it.
In the wake of repeated Israeli epidemics, many people marched on the streets because of the impact of government measures on their economic interests.
On 11 July, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv in the belief that the policy of combating the disease affected the economy.
On the evening of 21st, thousands more protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu ' s residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu ' s ban on restaurants and the lack of compensation for preventive measures such as the cafeteria.
In addition, many people do not wear masks during outdoor activities, maintain a two metre security social distance etc., and in order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people simply wear masks on their chins or on their wrists.
During the recurrence of the epidemic, schools were a major disaster area for the spread of the new coronary virus, and a recent visit to the kindergarten by journalists found that neither teachers nor students of the kindergarten were wearing masks at the request of the Government, nor were they able to maintain a safe social distance of two metres from each other, burying a large number of teachers and students with the virus.
Professor Elie Waxman, a member of the Israel National Security Council ' s Advisory Panel of Anti-Epidemic Experts, argued that Israel was moving towards a "dangerous situation", noting that the current measures taken by Israel to combat the epidemic were insufficient and that all leisure, recreational and summer schools should be closed in order to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman stated that Israel lacked an overall plan to combat the epidemic and that Parliament and government departments should move away from their own interests as soon as possible and reach agreement on the fight against the epidemic, with clear steps to include relevant restrictions in different sectors.
The newspaper Tel Aviv on July 25th, this newspaper reporter at Tel Aviv, Wang Chang.
Ningxia's farmer, Wu Feng Fong Fong, was no match for his old friend, Tianfu, two men in a car, from their home 20 miles away, to the Liang Yun cultural compound.
Despite these two years of unwieldy legs, the 77-year-old DeTienfu is still counting on "a trick to get here and get used to it."
This is an invisible courtyard in the city of Siuhara, unlike the normal farmyard, where the Qin cavity of the courtyard is often spread, as well as the scenes of the Qin, the embroidery, the traditional Qin cavity, the brows and so on.
The owner of the compound, Liang Yun, was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he started planning to build a cultural compound.
With the Liang Yun cultural compound, the villagers' cultural life has become rich.
The reporter hasn't entered the Liang Yun cultural compound and the tune of the Qin accent has been spread.
The Qin casket is being played by the neighboring village village of Peri-Shang for the villagers.
She's been in love with the Qin accent since she was a child, and now she's got a small local reputation, and she'll come to the cultural complex to show the folks when she's free.
More recently, Polly's playing live.
"There's a stage for more people to see themselves performing, it's a happy thing."
On the stage, the singers take a single look, the musicians play a single tune, but they're no less passionate than amateurs.
Like the pristine style of the farmhouse, outside the Qin cavity, the roots of the grass and non-relict culture of the Qin culture compound came to the surface.
The compound also contains over 300 items of agricultural tools, traditional and hand-made tiles, paper clippings, embroidery, leather shadow, etc.
Leung Yun led reporters into the courtyard displaying his collection of old objects, old wine pots, trichos, swirling cars, etc.
Why would a regular farmer build a cultural compound?
"Skin movies are my family art, and I've been studying it since I was 15 years old."
The Liang Yun Cultural Complex was established in 2012 as the first rural "Intangible Cultural Heritage Monument" in Ningxia, and as a model compound for the preservation of intangible cultural heritage in the city of sequester.
In addition to the Liang Yun cultural compound, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in the former districts of the city, including more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain size, such as the Shenjiang River cultural compound, Wang Yonghong cultural compound, Yangroon cultural compound, etc., covering the towns and streets of the former district, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grass-roots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the people and satisfying their spiritual needs.
"As life grows better, traditional culture cannot be left behind."
The Lew Dynasty has come back to win.
The 40-hundred battle show, Winning, will land on Beijing Watch from July 16th.
Winning is based on real history, based on Soviet military archives that have been under cover for many years, the first time ever.
An actor known to his audience as "The Treasures" has broken the image of the play and challenged a popular "Steak Agent".
Over the last few years, the funk of the masker, the kite, and so on, has proved the vitality of the war-type.
Unlike the old war work, "winner" looks at the world, stretching the story beyond the Soviet field of the Far East.
In the context of the final phase of the War against Japan in 1944, it told the story of the Chinese Communist Party secret intelligence worker Tang Fei, who, under the leadership of the Secretary of the Chinese Underground Party Lim River Province and the head of the Soviet Agency for Far East Intelligence, carried out the operations of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, Mudanura.
In a lot of theatres, the leading man, as a top spy, was a handsome, high-intelligent, mature and perfect image.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not a good spy, and "Spy should be the kind of guy who can't find anything in the crowd, and if he's out there, he's the kind of guy who's got to look at you, and everyone wants to look out for you," and there's a line in "You don't come after me, I forget I'm a nationalist" and the spy is going to be elitist."
So, in "winning," Liu Yun-Long made his master Tang Fei a happy "Standing Agent".
The other side of the Winner was joined up by the Japanese Fuwon and Lee Chibao Chief of Police.
One north and one south, two powerful actors, added a lot of great talent to the whole show.
Director Yin Fei used the word "twilight" to describe Li Li Qun and Liu Yun-Long's rivals in the play, "It's definitely a game, they're both very close, and they're very powerful for me. Many times they're `fashioned', like we write half a page of paper, and when I shoot it, they can keep on doing it."
It's not only the character that shapes the character, but also the audience that is more likely to see it, and it's only good to say that when actors are in the role and make sure they're in the character.
In the play, you can also see the faces familiar in many of the "Kills" and the famous "F4" of Mountain City, and three of the winnings.
Song Xiaoyan and Zhao Jang's Huo-yun and Liu Miyang, once again as Tang Fei's right arm.
Director Yin Fei introduced it, "These two men have no bad roots, but in that time, the environment was running away."
Liu Yunlong also offered, "We need to have a human touch, which means that there must be good and bad people around me and bad people are enemies, but also to develop them, and our teams will grow."
The end of the show was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believed that a satisfactory answer would be given to the audience.

Inner Mongolia, 4 students of the flag drowned.
On the evening of July 26th, the Chinese-newscomb called Renbel (journalist Lee Yiping), journalists learned from the government of the city of Hulenbel of the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia that four local students had died of drowning.
On 24 July, at 1550 hours, the Public Security Bureau of the flag of Arlong received a report that six junior high school students drowned in the area.
After the police were picked up, the local civilian police arrived at the scene first, rescued two students on the spot, followed by the local emergency authorities, the water authorities and others, and participated throughout the rescue.
It was reported that the rescue scene involved more than 80 members of the Public Security Police, the San police, the fire, medical and medical personnel, and that three rubber boats had been dispatched to the surrounding waters for sustained recovery, and that specialized rescue teams had been hired to arrive at the site to conduct underwater searches through sonar surveys.
Journalists learned that the first student was found by local rescue personnel on 25 July at 6.40 p.m., the second student was found on 25 July at 11.30 p.m., the third student was found on 25 July at 12.40 p.m. and the last student was found on 25 July at 13.34 p.m. The four above-mentioned persons were found to have no vital signs at the 120th emergency centre.
According to official sources, this drowning has been a wake-up call for the whole community.
At present, local authorities are compiling some knowledge about drowning prevention, hoping that the tragedy will not happen again.
Xinhua Society Hong Kong on July 25th, the Director General of Finance and Treasury of the HKSAR Government, Xu Jung-woo, said that Hong Kong's financial markets remained active and functioning in an orderly manner.
He was optimistic about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Xu Jung-woo said at an online seminar organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce (Congress Canada) on 24 (Toronto Time) that Hong Kong was experiencing a difficult situation due to the "modern wave" and the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
Hong Kong dollar exchange rates are stable and biased towards strong exchange guarantee levels.
The banking system has no clear indications of financial outflows; on the contrary, over $11 billion has been flowing since June.
Total bank deposits have also continued to increase over the past few months, and there has been a series of public fund-raising activities in the stock market, which have been on the rise.
Xu Jung-woo said that the new coronary pneumonia epidemic had put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong ' s fundamental advantages remained unchanged.
Hong Kong has a number of advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of information and capital, and simple low-tax systems, which keep Hong Kong at the forefront of international financial centres.
According to Xu Jung-woo, the HKSAR Government has set aside HK$6 billion from the Disease Control Fund to create some 30,000 time-bound jobs in the public and private sectors over the next two years, covering persons with different skills and qualifications.
In order to support the development of financial science and technology, the HKSAR Government has also launched the 1,000 People's Plan to finance local financial science and technology companies, start-ups and other businesses with financial science and technology-related operations to create 1,000 new jobs, hire local talent and enrich Hong Kong's pool of financial science and technology.
Looking ahead, Xu Jung-woo is optimistic about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to take advantage of Hong Kong ' s strengths and its status as an international financial centre, an international asset and wealth management centre and a global offshore renminbi business hub for development and investment in and around the Bay of Australasia region of Hong Kong.
The newspaper "The Lancet" praised China's efforts to combat the disease and encouraged countries to learn from their experiences.
According to the Journal 25 of The Lancet, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion, similar in size to Europe or the United States, China is effectively controlling the epidemic at this stage, without any further widespread transmission, to a large extent controlling the epidemic in the country.
According to the article, over the past 10 years, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction, making it much better prepared for the new crown than for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in that year.
According to the author, at the time of the 2002 SARS outbreak, China was initially ill-prepared, especially because the pathogen could not be determined.
When the new coronary virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists quickly identified the type of virus and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on 11 January 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had articulated the clinical characteristics of the virus, warning the world about the threat of the new crown virus through research papers published on the Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, which has been carried out very quickly and strictly through close domestic cooperation during the declared state of emergency. In May and July, respectively, the results of the early trials of the new crown vaccine developed by China were published on the Willows.
China ' s experience shows that it is important to invest in national health and research systems and to effectively improve laboratory capabilities.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, particularly low- and middle-income countries, are highly worthy of learning and learning.
Moreover, China ' s experience has shown that, on the basis of strong research, a strong high-level and decisive decision-making based on scientific evidence is necessary to effectively control the new crown outbreak.
The article stresses the need for Governments and their leaders to respect science, understand its value and act on it in the most socially beneficial manner ...
In the early days of the outbreak, the Chinese National Guard appointed three teams of infectious disease specialists to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new coronary virus. Their recommendations informed the decision of January 23 in Wuhan to seal the city; the Government took decisions and implemented them quickly when experts suggested the necessity and urgency of building the quadrant hospital; and the broad participation of the community and the population enabled the epidemic to be brought under control quickly and effectively.
The article concludes by emphasizing that responding to global health emergencies requires greater global cooperation and joint responses by countries.

Former inspector of the city council of Uhai, Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia, was expelled from the Party - Sino-New Network
On 26 July, the Chinese Network reported to the Supervisory Board of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region that, with the approval of the Party Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Supervisory Board of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region had conducted a case review of the serious breaches of discipline in the platinum Sea by the former inspector of the City Council of the City of U.S.A.
It has been found that the platinum, as a leader of a party, has lost its idealistic belief and has openly violated the principles of party nature and opposed the reform of the organization; that the organization is indifferent, that it is not in a position to arrange for another person ' s transfer and receive other persons ' property in the selection of a cadre; that it is economically greedy, that it is in breach of the rules of business to obtain substantial benefits, to trade in power and money for the purpose of self-interest; and that the corruption of life has had a negative impact.
The platinum sea constitutes a serious breach of political discipline, organized discipline, clean discipline, life discipline, official offence and suspected of bribery, corruption, non-constrained, non-stop, bad character and serious circumstances after the party ' s eighteenth birthday.
In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Regulations on Disciplinary Punishment by the Communist Party of China " The Monitoring Law of the People ' s Republic of China " , and with the approval of the Standing Committee of the Disciplinary Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which considered and reported to the Party Committee of the Mongolian Autonomous Region, it was decided that the platinum Sea would be subject to dismissal and that its treatment would be adjusted accordingly; that the proceeds of its disciplinary offences would be collected; and that his alleged offences would be referred to the prosecution authorities for review and prosecution in accordance with the law, and that the property involved would be transferred with the law.
In the afternoon of 25 local time, a small plane crashed on the top floor of a multi-storey residential building in Wessel County, Northern Germany, killing three people.
The Duisburg prosecution, the Wessel County Police Department and the Wessel City Fire Department jointly issued a statement the same evening that at about 1440 hours on the same day, a small aircraft crashed into a house on the top of a multi-storey residential building on Peiberscamp Street, Wessel County, killing three people.
It took off the same day from the city of Mar, Ruhr district, Northern Wei State, and again after stopping midway at the airport in Wessel County, then hit the residential building.
The identity of the deceased or two passengers on board a female household and a small aircraft in the house affected by the attack.
A two-year-old in the room was slightly injured and was safely rescued.
The rest of the house was not injured in the accident, but the mood was still unsettled.
The scenes reported by the German News Agency show that the house that was hit by the accident was in the air and that firemen put out the fire and the house was seriously damaged.
At present, the cause of the crash is unclear.
The "Rhine Post" quoted police reports that there were clues that the plane had broken up before it hit the residential building.
According to the police, multiple parts of the crash plane were found in the area of the accident.
The German Criminal Police is working with the Duisburg prosecution, the German Federal Aviation Accident Investigation Agency, to investigate the cause of the accident.
The journalist learned from the Chinese Consulate General in Düsseldorf on the same day that it had contacted the local police station and the fire department and that none of the casualties had been found to be Chinese citizens.
The Singapore Ministry of Health announced on 26th day that, as of 1200 hours on that day, there were 481 new confirmed cases in Singapore, with 50369 cumulative confirmed cases; 27 cumulative deaths.
The data show that of the new confirmed cases, 5 were local community cases, 4 were imported cases and the rest were foreign workers living in special hostels.
According to the Singapore Ministry of Health, 98 per cent of new confirmed cases are related to known infections.
There are still 173 new coronary patients in the hospital, most of them stable or improved, and no one is in the intensive care unit.
In addition, 4648 people were separated from community facilities.
The majority of Singapore ' s new crown infections are foreign workers.
According to statistics, there are 200,000 foreign workers living in 43 special accommodations for foreign workers in Singapore and about 100,000 foreign workers living in other types of hostels.
The Singapore Inter-Sectoral Working Group on Disease Control has recently indicated that the Singapore Government is stepping up testing for the last few specialized accommodations for foreign workers with high rates of new crown infection.
After the completion of the testing of all specialized dormitories, the vast majority of foreign workers will be able to return to work, but they will still have to undergo a new crown test on a regular basis.
The director of Da Peng is in the Golden Lord's Award - Xinhuanet.
On July 18, the twenty-third Shanghai International Film Festival published the list of selected films for the Golden Prize.
Director Da Peng's first real-life film, "Happily" , successfully joined the film festival award, and the film officially released its first poster.
Posters, film supply charts
The film "Happiness" is the first realism by Da Peng Director and his second connection to the Golden Lord's Award.
The film tells the story of a comedy director who, out of surprise, went back to his village in the northeast, hoping to make his family a literary film in the year, and suffered a series of accidents.
The family members gathered for the film finished their last party.
In today's film poster, one of the members of this family — "Mother Uncle" Xiang — sits in the middle of the picture and smokes in the background of the black land of the Northeast in silver, with the prospect of a red light cage that Chinese must hang during their holidays.
As a symbol of joy, the red-lighted red-lighted red-lighted hallowed by the shadow of the King seems to reveal the complexity and intimacy of this extended family relationship.
According to the report, apart from the role played by the actor Liu Liu's daughter, the film's experimental audio-visual style, which broke the boundaries between drama and reality, gave the audience a new immersion experience.
According to Director Da Peng, the creation of the "good luck" arose from a series of sudden changes in the family during the shooting, which had to change the original plans, and life without script was eventually recorded as a film, but released the power beyond design.
How does Director Da Peng deal with this "sign of God" and how does he continue to face the changes that this will bring about?
There is no doubt that "good luck" is an experimental, almost universal, audio-visual style that transforms life in front of the camera into a film, and that, in a package of real images, the viewers will find their own and their family's shadow from the family that the film presents, and a series of thoughts will be inspired by the end of this family gathering.
NEWS.GOV.MO: Query hotline statistics for the new coronary HIV response centre (08H00 July 25th - July 26th 08H00)
From 08H00, 2507, to 08H00, 26 July 2020, the new coronary virus response centre ' s referral hotline received 292 calls.
With regard to the 291 inquiries concerning the epidemic, the following information has been communicated immediately to the representatives of the relevant departments:
271 HB (involving: inquiries about isolation; inquiries about nucleic acid tests; inquiries about two land plates; health codes; other)
17 police stations (concerning: search for entry and exit measures; search for entry and exit measures for vehicles of both sexes; search for the Pearlhai policy hotline; search for documents for stay...)
1 at the Tourist Board (in relation to inquiries about segregated hotels . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
EYAD 1 (concerning: searching for methods of returning students from Macao to study in England...)
1 for the Maritime and Water Authority (i.e. to ask if Hong Kong fishing vessels enter Hong Kong for notification to the Maritime and Water Authority and for nucleic acid testing)
Barto Drukon post, Long Yu Wang and a soldier are on duty.
At this average temperature of about a dozen degrees a year, a row of simple barracks stands at the entrance of the mountain, the camp is not far away and the flag is up and running, and the soldiers are on duty in the wind every day, with regular patrols to higher altitude locations.
The warriors climb the steep slopes of the rocks and need both hands and feet.
It's late in July, when the low-lying areas are thick and thick, and Baldochon, where only the trenches behind the barracks are relatively green.
The soldiers who had been stationed at the post for six years pointed to the ravine and said that it was their backyard and that only in July and August of each year could we see grass growing slowly, and soon after it was turned yellow and covered by snow.
A foot patrol could take about nine hours.
In the harsh highland environment, the soldiers who are stationed here are always accompanied by snow mountains and glaciers, and they also regularly patrol higher mountain crossings at sea.
Today, a patrol consisting of eight fighters led by the mentor, Ye-sung Leung, took the patrol road again.
Each soldier weighs about 30 pounds and moves to the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier is in a state of rebellion, and the comrades are in urgent need of help.
In addition to the patrol, the soldiers at Barto Drukon are trained in tactics and physical abilities on a daily basis.
Time passes one minute, altitude rises, oxygen levels are getting lower and body strength is constantly overstretched, and these factors test the will of the patrolmen.
They gnawed their teeth, crossed a few landslides and crossed a few critical beaches.
It's 1600 hours for the patrol's crew to bring their own dry food and sit on the ground at an altitude of over 5,700 metres, with rain and snow and food to supplement their strength.
The soldiers at Barto Drukon are trained in tactics and physical abilities.
During rest periods, they play cards together, losers do push-ups, both entertain and exercise.
After a short break in the cold, they climbed up to the target of this patrol, took out their flag on the hillside, solemnly sworn.
Behind them are Mount Mamas and they are dozens of kilometres of no-man's land, and they are the safest guardians of the country's gates.
Beijing Consumption Season Reboot - Xinhua Network
The Beijing City reboots its activities during the season in accordance with the principle of "a comprehensive reboot, focused planning, well-organized and well-organized".
On July 26th, 1.5 million coupons were issued, of which 1 million were tickets for off-line catering, 500,000 were tickets for smart products, and consumers were allowed to receive them at the APP in Tokyo.
Liu Mei Ying, Deputy Director General of the Beijing City Business Bureau, presented at the 25th press conference that the re-opening of the consumer season would further reduce business matching on the basis of maintaining the level of subsidy of the existing coupon card packs.
Starting in early August, government and enterprise funding was adjusted to the current scale of 1:1, i.e., when a consumer received a card pack to a store, he would have received a 120-dollar concession, of which the Government subsidized $60 and the enterprise benefited $60; and after the adjustment, the government subsidized $80 and the enterprise benefited $40.
During the consumption season, three major operators will subsidize flows and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting 5G new infrastructure and 5G new consumption in Beijing.
Chen Mo-bo, who says Hong Kong's economy has been hit by another outbreak of the epidemic, is calling on all sides to get together for a while.
On July 26, China News Agency Hong Kong, the Director of Finance of the HKSAR Government, Chen Maobo, stated that Hong Kong had a positive impact on a new wave of new coronary pneumonia, and that business and economic activity had been hit by a slight recovery.
The HKSAR Government once again calls on all large and small owners to reduce rents and to work with retailers and small and medium-sized enterprises in times of hardship.
Chen Mo-bau posted an article on the day of the Internet entitled "The Road to Routine Recovery".
He said that the recent high number of cases of new coronary pneumonia diagnosed in Hong Kong was critical, affecting the lives of the population and affecting the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the first priority is to prevent entry cases and to treat and disrupt the transmission chain of the virus as quickly as possible; when the epidemic is controlled, economic activity should resume in due course.
He pointed out that in the face of a new outbreak of disease, business and economic activity, which had been slightly recovered, had also been hit.
For the business community, social responsibility is no less important than the spirit of the contract, especially those groups that receive large government subsidies in the Employment Guarantee Scheme.
He mentioned that the economic situation in Hong Kong in the second quarter of this year was still very serious, but the contraction seemed to have slowed slightly.
On the export side, he believes that the situation in Hong Kong ' s periphery is still serious.
According to Chen Maobo, Hong Kong's development history over the past few decades shows that every crisis hides new opportunities and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
A winter morning a few years ago, in Johannesburg, South Africa, when I drove to work, I found the city covered in fog.
I drive through there almost every day, but this time it's unusual, and I've never seen anything like it before.
Johannesburg was known for its unique beauty, but it was barely seen that morning.
Soon I realized that what I saw was a severe fog caused by air pollution.
The contrast between that beautiful environment that I know so well in the past and the skyline that is cloudy at this moment is in my heart.
I'm afraid there's a possibility that the dark fog will be swallowed by the colorful sunset.
At that moment, I felt a strong impulse to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
All I know is I can't just stand by and watch.
The biggest challenge is that I don't know about environmental science, air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer, and I'm pretty sure I can't use codes to solve the problem of atmospheric pollution.
What am I going to do with this?
I'm just a town boy.
In the next few years, I learned a very important lesson, and if we want a better future, we should all keep it in mind.
Even if you're not an expert in a particular field, your professional skills may imply ways to solve problems in that area.
Sometimes you have a unique perspective that inspires unconventional thinking and thus shapes the situation, but you need to be bold enough to try.
That's the only way you'll know what's going on.
All I knew at the time was that if I wanted to try to change, I had to know enough about pollution first, so I became a student again.
I did some basic research, and I quickly learned that atmospheric pollution is the world's greatest environmental health risk.
World Health Organization data show that in 2012, almost 14 per cent of deaths worldwide were caused by atmospheric pollution in and around households, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
The annual mortality from atmospheric pollution is higher than malaria and AIDS.
In Africa, premature deaths caused by unsafe sanitation, or deaths caused by malnutrition among children, appear pale in the face of atmospheric pollution, and it also has enormous economic costs: according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, spending in 2013 exceeded $400 billion.
In my work, I'm looking for the advances of artificial intelligence, including the symbiotic relationship between humans and machines, to find useful ground and help us make better decisions.
And when I think about the problem of atmospheric pollution, how to deal with the problem of atmospheric pollution, it becomes clear that we need to find better ways to make better decisions, considering the magnitude of the problem, it's very important to work together.
So I decided to meet some people who work in this field.
I started talking to officials in Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, and I joined the local scientific community, and I called people who were completely strangers but were connected.
The experience that I've been involved in has helped me to understand this more deeply.
And it helped me avoid the traps that people in my line of work sometimes fall into when they try to innovate: before they really know the problem, quickly adopt a technology.
I started thinking, what can I do to improve this situation?
I started asking myself, how to effectively integrate my knowledge skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence and the professional skills of the people I contacted.
I want to create an online air quality management platform to reveal future pollution trends, make projections to determine what might happen.
I'm sure my idea can be a realistic solution, but I can't guarantee it's going to work.
All I have is a specific set of engineer skills, the skills I've acquired from my work.
I've come to realize that sometimes there's a new perspective, a new skill set, that can give rise to something remarkable.
Our willpower and imagination is a beacon that tells us to cross the barrier and open a new chapter.
I've developed a deeper understanding of the problem of atmospheric pollution, and I've been looking for data on atmospheric pollution over the past 10 years, as well as weather data in and around Johannesburg, and I've been working with colleagues from South Africa and China to create an air quality resolution support system and upload it to cloud ends.
This software can analyze historical and real-time data to reveal trends in pollution over time and space.
We then use new machine techniques to predict future contamination a few days in advance.
That means residents can make better decisions about their daily journeys and where their family lives.
We can anticipate adverse pollution events, define the sources of heavy contamination, and allow the authorities to direct them to adjust their operations.
Through complementary scenario planning, urban planners can make better decisions about how to expand infrastructure work, such as housing in industrial areas.
We've built a pilot of that technology, run for 120 days, covering the whole of South Africa.
The predictions that we've shown and the data that we've collected on the ground show a close correlation.
Through our management, we have introduced the world ' s leading sophisticated instrument for predicting atmospheric quality, and its resolution and correctness have been unprecedented, allowing my city to benefit from the recent winter morning. I said to myself, "There's something wrong, I have to do something."
So the point is, what if I didn't study the problem of atmospheric pollution in the first place?
What if I don't focus on the state of the country's environment, but rather hope in some places, some other people are in charge of these things?
What I've learned from this is that it's important to focus on the possibility of success and consider the consequences of inaction when we're all committed to a cause that we all believe in.
We shouldn't be distracted by opposition and resistance, it should inspire us to go further.
So wherever you're in the world, the next time you find out that some sort of curiosity that you're born to be aroused, and it's about what you mean, you have some crazy or brave ideas, even if it's not your field of expertise, ask yourself: why don't you try it?
Why don't you go ahead and solve the problem, do your best, in your own way?
You might get the surprise.
Thank you.

This year's biggest earthquake in Taiwan's eastern waters - the China-New Network
On July 26th, the Chinese-news agency in Taipei, at 2052 hours on the eastern coast of Taiwan, there was an earthquake of the Richter scale, with a maximum shock level 4 and a full-stage shock, the largest earthquake on the entire island this year.
Integrated Central News, Chinese-Time Electronics, ETtoday News Clouds, etc., Taiwan's Meteorological Department reports that the earthquake struck 86.5 km south-east of the Illan County Government, i.e., the eastern sea area of Taiwan, with a depth of 53 km.
China's seismic network determined the earthquake to be 5.5 degrees.
The largest earthquakes across the region are: 4 in Hualian County, 4 in Yilan County, 1 in Taidong County, 3 in Nanjan County, and 3 in Yun Lin County, and 1 to 2 in other districts and municipalities.
According to the Taiwan Meteorological Department, the earthquake has been the largest in the entire region since this year, with hidden-band earthquakes at the edge of the plate, with earthquakes occurring in the past and active since this year.
In the coming week, the aftershocks above level 4 will not be ruled out.
A lot of people think driving is something that only those who can see can do.
The blind wanted to drive a car safely alone, and until now, it was considered an impossible task.
Hi, my name is Dennis Hong, and we made a car designed for people with visual impairments for the freedom and independence of the blind.
Before I tell you about this blind car, let me briefly say that another project I've done was called the United States Department of Defense Advanced Research Program City Challenge.
It's about making a robotic car that can drive on its own.
You press the start button, you don't touch anything, and it's completely automatic to reach its destination.
At the 2007 Challenge, our team won $500,000 to win number three.
About that time, the National Blind Society, or the Blind Society, challenged the design team about who could design a car that would allow the blind to drive independently and safely.
We thought we'd try it, because we thought, "Hey, where's this gonna be hard?"
We've got an automatic car.
We just have to get blind people to drive inside. That's it, isn't it?
But we're wrong.
It's not a car that the blind can walk around, it's a car that the blind can choose and control.
So we had to give up everything we had and start from the beginning.
To test this crazy idea, we designed a prototype of a small sand truck to test its viability.
In the summer of 2009, we invited a lot of blind young people across the country and gave them a second chance to drive around with this car.
It's definitely a cool experience.
But the problem with this car is that it can only be designed to drive blind people in a very limited environment, like a closed parking lot -- even on a little road with a red traffic cone.
So with this success, we decided to move on to the important next step, to make a real car that could drive on the real road.
How does it work?
Well, it's a relatively complex system, but let me explain it and simplify it.
We have three stages.
We have the induction phase, the calculation phase and the non-visual interface.
The pilot is obviously invisible, so the system must be able to sense the surroundings and collect data for the driver.
At that point, we use the initial measurement element.
It measures acceleration, angle acceleration -- like human ears, inner ears.
I combine this information with GPS to predict where the vehicle is.
We're also using two cameras to detect the path of the car.
We're still using three laser rangers.
Laser scans the environment to detect the barrier -- the vehicle that goes through the front, the vehicle that goes through the back, and any obstacle that comes into the road, any obstacle around the vehicle.
All the big information goes back to the computer, and the computer does two things.
First of all, one thing is to process information to understand the surrounding environment -- which is the path of the car and which is the barrier -- and to convert that information to the driver.
The system is also intelligent enough to figure out the safest way to travel.
We can also give instructions on how to operate a vehicle.
But the question is: how can we transmit information and instructions fast enough and accurate enough to the blind to make sure he can drive?
To that end, we designed a variety of non-visual user interface techniques.
The initial three-dimensional stereo system, vibrating vests, sound-control gears, leg belts, even shoes that put pressure on their feet.
But today we're talking about three of these non-visual user interfaces.
The first interface is called the driver's handle.
It's a pair of gloves, it has vibrating components at the point of reference, so you can transmit instructions on how to move -- direction and range.
Another device is called a speed band.
This chair -- actually, it's a massage chair.
We take it out, we reassemble different kinds of vibrating components, we send them to transmit speed information, and we also have instructions on how to use gas doors and brakes.
Here, you can see how the computer understands the surroundings, because you can't see the vibrations, and we actually put red light diodes on the driver, so he can see what's happening.
This is the sensor data, which is transferred from the sensor to the computer.
So these two devices, the handles and the speed tremors, are very effective.
But the problem is, these are signal devices.
So it's not really freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive -- left, right, speed, brake.
I call it a copilot problem.
So we're avoiding command signal devices, and we're focusing more on information devices.
A typical example of this non-visual information interface is called an empty map.
Look at this as a blind monitor.
It's a small desktop with holes on it, compressed air out of it, so it can be described as a picture.
So even if you're blind and you put your hand on it, you can sense the path and the obstacles.
In fact, you can change the frequency of air releases and possibly the temperature.
It's actually a multidimensional user interface.
Here, you can see the cameras on the left, on the right, and how the computer interprets and transmits this information to the blanks.
That's it. We're showing a simulator, a blind man driving with an empty map.
This program is very helpful in training blind drivers and fast testing different theories based on different kinds of non-visual user interfaces.
That's how it basically works.
But it's a model car, and it won't go unless it's proven to be as safe to drive as today's car, or safer.
I really believe this is going to happen.
But is society, can they accept this radical idea?
How are we going to deal with insurance?
How will we issue our driver's license?
There are many different obstacles behind the technological challenge that we need to address before it really becomes a reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a blind car.
But what might be more important than that is the enormous value inherent in the by-products of this project.
The sensors that can be used to see the darkness, the fog.
And with this new kind of interface, we can use these technologies to make them more secure for visible people.
Or for the blind, the household devices that live on a daily basis -- educational facilities, office facilities applications.
Imagine, in class, teachers writing notes on blackboards and blind students using these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what teachers write.
It's extremely valuable.
Today, what I'm showing you is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.

Malinichev says that changes in value are influenced by the devaluation of the ruble and the epidemic.
He said, "The cost of services is increasing.
As a result of the epidemic, people start spending more time on the Internet. "
Malinichev does not rule out a significant annual increase in Internet prices, arguing that operators can provide customers with higher speeds and more services to offset people ' s dissatisfaction with rising prices.
The Chinese Doctor has prepared a tribute to the hero of the disease, Xinhua Network.
In recent days, with a tribute from Chinese cinematographers against the hero of the disease, the director of the Bona Films Group in the winter, director Liu Weiqiang (Tutsang) in Guangzhou and a member of the Chongnan Mountain courtyard, had a conversation on the production of the anti-epidemic film "China Doctor".
The Bonne film industry wishes to pay tribute to all the medical and preventive workers who fought on the front line of the epidemic with the help of Chinese doctors!
In 2021, the film will be presented as a national film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, the Bonne film industry is being deployed under the auspices of the Chinese Ministry and the National Film Bureau, with the support of the Guangdong Province Film Bureau and the Hubei Province Film Bureau, to organize a film by the Chinese pilot, the Chinese doctor, which is reflected in the strong leadership of the Party and the unity of the people of the country in the fight against the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
The film focuses on the Wuhan anti-virus line, using the background of Wuhan medical personnel and provincial and municipal medical teams, unique narratives from a humanistic perspective, as well as extremely powerful lens language, and presents a moving story of Chinese medical personnel on the prophylactic front line who are dedicated and sacrificed.
It is known that during the first days of Wuhan's release, Bona was able to overcome its difficulties by sending a team to go deep into the epidemic, exchanging information in person with hundreds of medical workers, gathering information that has now been interviewed, among others, by the Men of Chungnan Hills, by the First Man in Guangzhou, by the Guangdong Medical Unit, and by the Medical Unit in Guangdong, as well as by Wuhan Jinxung Hospital, Wuhan and the Hospital, Wuhan University Middle South Hospital, White Angels at the forefront of the anti-infection front, such as Wuhan Central Hospital, and others.
In this symposium, Master Chung Nansan also raised expectations and hopes for film production: "I look forward to seeing not only some of the more visible experts, but also more of the medical staff who work on the front line, who are the majority of them."
He said he'd seen "me and my country" and "China captain" before, and he thought it would be nice to tell stories about big patterns from a normal human perspective.
"Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstanding about China."
With regard to the distribution of the film, Mr. Chung Nanshan said that some people abroad currently prefer to label the virus as politicized and that he hoped that the film would impress the audience from a human point of view: "In addition to being shown in China, it would be better to present the film abroad, using the real human spirit, in a way that both national and international viewers can understand."
Master Chung Nansan also remembered the film "Man to Middle Ages" of the 1980s, and after all these years, "Man to Middle Ages" was the most impression I had of the movie after the opening of the reform, when my doctors and friends abroad cried, and it would be amazing if "China Doctor" could do that."
Mr. Jong-namsan said it would be very successful if "Chinese doctor" could have a resonance with foreign audiences.
During the conversation, Master Jong-nam also shared ideas and proposals for the prevention and control of the current international epidemic, "I believe that people will always be smarter than the virus."
According to Mr. Chung Nanshan, although the virus is unpredictable, humans have survived so far from the original society, which today has developed medical technologies and social management measures, together with a basic understanding of science in response to the new coronary pneumonia epidemic around the world and even among the general population, and people are no longer as passive as they used to be. "The next step is to study how the world can strengthen cooperation, and the second is to focus on comforting people."

"Red fruit" mountain -- the first Red Book meeting today.
The Hunan Daily News, New Hunan client reporter, Jiang Wei, correspondent, Shaw Yan.
The Red Boat Modifier, the Kuan-Tung bronze statue, the Yaon-an-Yun-Yun-soon meat... July 25th, 2020 Hunan Red Tourist Culture Festival opened in the Mountain.
As one of the main events, the first Red Industry Fair was held at the Global Tourism Advisory Centre in Sasayama.
The exhibition area is full of red-text products, old-revolutionary ground products and so forth, leading tourists from all over the world to compete for it.
" The Red Games are both a demonstration of the achievements of the red cultural industry throughout the country and an important platform for the sharing of experiences between the exhibitors and the business community in exploring the path to development ... "
The head of the Executive Committee of the First Red Games, introduced by the President, said that the Red Games had been dedicated to the theme "Fostering Red Cultures for the Heating of the Tour", with a total area of nearly 3,000 square metres, setting up an atmosphere-building area, displaying displays of the exhibition areas and the Red Brigade Networking Experiences.
We invited 137 enterprises, including Zhejiang Ka-hing, Guozhou, 8 foreign provinces and cities such as Chen Xiyan and my Governor, Sha, Chang, Yang, Zhang, and others, to exhibit a total of 768 exhibits, including red artifacts, handicrafts, special food products, tourist routes, red training courses, red text products, etc.
The exhibition area will be displayed until July 29th.
As the host of the Red League, the show is bright.
The director of the exhibition area introduced the division between the red industry and the development of the red cultural industry.
The Red Industry Fair displays 31 exhibits from six enterprises, including Wallith Steel, Wallith cable, thorium power, and the Red Cultural Industry Development Fair exhibites a red series of books, a red series of foods, a red series of literary products and nearly 200 items per unit.
In the Yanan district, many tourists are attracted to displaying flowering and paper cutting works.
On the occasion of the exhibition, the director of the Yenan City Department of Arts and Tourism, Matungpo, carefully selected the best red-language product of Yeon An for nearly two years, 16 of which were excellent works of 2019 national red-language products.
At the same time, they invited the heirs of the national Intangible Cultural Heritage Conservation Project "Anse Scissors", the "Hong Bei Song" and the provincial non-relicted project "Yanchue" to focus on the Yanyan Folklore special products and to take the opportunity to communicate with other exhibiting enterprises and promote cross-regional cooperation.
The cumulative number of new cases diagnosed in Japan is over 30,000 - Xinhuanet
According to statistics, 239 new confirmed cases were recorded in Tokyo on 26 days, and more than 200 new cases were recorded on a single-day basis for a period of six days, bringing the total to 11214.
In addition, 141 new confirmed cases were recorded in Osaka, 90 in Fukuoka County and 80 in Aichi County.
In the first half of the year, 70 per cent of the telecommunication network frauds increased.
In the first half of the year, the National Prosecution Service prosecuted a total of 58101 persons for fraud, a 35 per cent increase over the previous year.
In particular, the number of fraud-related offences is high, and the number of fraud-related offences prosecuted by the prosecution service accounts for 43.4 per cent of the total number of fraud-related offences.
The Supreme People ' s Procuratorate has provided targeted guidance, and a total of nine cases involving fraud have been issued in 10 typical cases involving disease prevention and control.
In the first half of the year, the prosecution authorities had found that there was a great deal of publicity for fraud, up to the country's macro-policies, down to the people's homes, including epidemic-related fraud, "medical" fraud, "health-care" fraud, "medical" fraud, "sex-in-aid" fraud, "hiding" fraud, "shelter-in-the-State fraud" fraud, "frozen-off fraud" of national assets, and so on, and that there were a number of areas that were "new" and covered education, health care, employment, old age, social security, land-relocation, poverty alleviation, financial credit and so on, causing not only economic losses to victims but also serious economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network frauds break through national borders, territorial and human limitations, have popular, cross-border, remote, electronic payment features, and are not targeted by specific groups of victims and are highly harmful.
For example, specialized companies have been set up, high-end writing buildings have been rented, departments or posts have been created, legal web platforms have been used to promote, recruit, train and test recruiters, and business models have been used to manage them, and they have become more confusing in their "legitimate" clothes.
It is incumbent upon the Public Prosecutor ' s Office to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and to provide prompt warning to the public and the authorities concerned.
In cases before the courts, the prosecution service has taken on serious responsibilities by maintaining a high level of pressure on fraud and tailoring law enforcement initiatives to promote social governance through, inter alia, the development and issuance of prosecutorial recommendations.
The Public Prosecution Service strictly controls arrests, prosecutions for fraud, evidence, procedures and application of the law, is based on facts, is guided by the law and is impartial.
In particular, for telecommunication network fraud offences, emphasis is placed on the central role of electronic data in fact-finding, and efforts are made to construct electronic data, verbal evidence, cross-substantiated evidence chains between documentary evidence.
For example, in the case of an epidemic-related fraud handled by the district prosecutor ' s office in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, the prosecutor ' s office intervenes early in the first place, from the time of the incident to the conclusion of the case, and only five days after the case was completed, reflecting the attitude and determination of the public authorities to maintain stability.
In reviewing the arrest and prosecution chain, focusing on the prosecution of missing persons in the case, correcting the failure of the public security organs to arrest 733 persons and correcting the omission of the public security organs to examine and prosecute 1,113 co-perpetrators.
In the first half of the year, the National Prosecution Service issued 298 prosecutorial recommendations on fraud, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud and promote deeper governance.
For example, in response to deficiencies in the regulation of telecommunications networks found in the case, banks, intermediaries, etc., the Guangzhou Municipal Public Prosecutor ' s Office of Guangdong Province and the Dongang Municipal Public Prosecutor ' s Office issued timely inspection recommendations urging the authorities concerned to strengthen their supervision, improve their mechanisms and contribute to the development of a system of long-term effectiveness.
The fourth is to do everything in his power to recover the damage.
The prosecution authorities in all regions have seized the crucial part of their involvement in leading investigations and evidence, examining prosecutions, and have urged investigative authorities to actively pursue the recovery of the proceeds and to cooperate with the authorities in their efforts to minimize the economic damage caused to the population by fraudulent offences.
For example, the Beijing City Prosecutor's Office dealt with a loan package for 22 housing units awaiting closure, initiated a "waiting letter" in the event that the property could be pre-empted in other cases, submitted it to the relevant court in a timely manner, recommending that the court of first seizure suspend the property in question, proceed to a uniform disposal pending the identification of the crime, and make the utmost effort to recover the property in question and recover the victim's loss.
The prosecutor reminds you that you need to be very vigilant about fraud, not to look for "spill pies out of the sky" or to think you're cheap enough to hold your own "money bag".
Quinning County, Guizhou: The apple tree is short, the way out of poverty - the net is new.
Source: China Economic Network.
Inflammation, economics daily - Chinese Economic Network journalists walked into the town of Jinhai in Wining County, Guizhou province.
In the face of the sun, the villagers, Li Won-chung, groved in the base and sung a little song from time to time, despite the redness of his face.
Weining County, where the town is located, has not been able to sell a good price because of its low latitude, high altitude, sufficient light, very hot day and night, high levels of sugar in apples and good taste, but because of its small size and number of spots, it has not been able to make an industrial scale.
That town was a poor town called "Spring and Fall", with a poverty incidence of 25.8% 10 years ago.
During the critical period of the fight against poverty into the final battle, it is urgent to change traditional planting habits and restructure the industry to increase farmers ' incomes.
After a number of visits by Chen Guang and a group of people from the town, the Governor of the Quanjin Party concluded that industrial development could no longer go the same way.
To that end, the town of Jinn has introduced a leading company to grow apples in a modern way.
The Deputy General Manager of Winning Beyond Agriculture Ltd., Hu Jianwen, came to Jinxi Town in 2015 to look at the local planting conditions, starting in 2016 with the local planting of apple trees.
At first, when the village mobilized Lee Won-chung to turn the land out and plant the apple tree, the two of Li Yuan-chung and his wife made a murmur: "Sown apples for so many years and didn't see who grew apples in the village rich."
"All the apples are short apples. They don't grow too tall."
What Lee Won-chung did not think was that this apple plant had a new approach, irrigated the pipes under every apple tree, poured the water with the fertilizer into the roots, and when the fruit was harvested in the fall, the tractor drove straight into the orchard and stood to pick the fruit.
The Apple Base is now entering productive life, and the market, as Hu Jianwen had predicted, is not too sad, and is very popular with consumers in cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and others.
The growing apple industry has brought about a new change in the life of Li Yuan Trung and, although still growing land, a new source of income.
Nine acres of land flowed to Apple Base. Every year, in addition to the land transfer fee from the base, there was a profit bonus after the nuts, and the couple usually worked in the base, "One man gets $80 a day and has a job every year."
Lee Won-chung told reporters that last year 's profit was 2,800 grand, plus the land transfer fee and the income of the couple ' s work, and that the family earned 80,000 grand.
"Acre apples produce more than $15,000 per year, about 10 times the value of corn. "
She told reporters that the entire town of Xuan has now planted 20,000 acres of apples, 6,000 acres in the village of Nakhai alone, covering 4056 rural households, 1.72 million people, including 656 poor families and 2952 poor families in Lica, paying more than $6 million a year, making it truly possible to build a base at the door of the house and not to go out to work.
Li Yuan Trung, whose waistbags are growing, has also begun to fulfil his own wish.
This spring season, Li Yuanzhung bought a Land Cruiser, like driving to and from work today. "There's still more than a dozen acres of land in the house.

The membrane separation technology helped crack the greenhouse effect.
The membrane separation technology helped crack the greenhouse effect.
Map of new hybrid matrix-based membrane preparation techniques
Reporter Swe reported that the Air Environment and Bioenergy Team at Tianjin University had made significant progress on carbon dioxide capture for the film separation method, successfully developing new hybrid matrix-based membrane preparation techniques and significantly increasing the carbon dioxide capture performance of film materials.
The results have been published as an article on the cover of the international journal Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology.
The greenhouse effect is a major environmental problem that plagues human development, and CO2 emissions are the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect.
The efficient capture and utilization of human carbon dioxide emissions is the focus of scientists ' attention.
The membrane separation method is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology that separates carbon dioxide gases with the help of membrane materials and is efficient, energy-efficient and simple to operate.
How to "breathe deeply" membrane materials, improve the efficiency of gas separation, is a bottleneck for carbon dioxide capture using membrane separation.
The scientific team at Tianjin University has developed innovative ideas to explore the effects of different solvents on the separability of membrane gases through repeated experiments.
The results of the experiment showed that N-methyl methadone was used as a solvent to produce a more even distribution of carbon nanotubes in the membrane material, "better air" and effectively increased the gas separation efficiency and speed of the membrane material.
With this new technology, mixed matrix membrane, CO2 separability is close to the current theoretical separation cap for this type of membrane material.
" New technologies offer new ideas for carbon dioxide capture by membrane separation methods ... "
Li Yun, a member of the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team at Tianjin University, said: "We hope that this technology will provide strong support to future coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises in handling flue gases and play a significant role in areas such as controlling greenhouse gas emissions.

Before volunteering, you'll have to figure out what's a professional grade difference.
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning News
Before you volunteer, you'll have to figure out what a professional is.
Every year, students or parents are affected by volunteering because they don't know the terminology involved in the voluntary filing.
This year, Beijing Transport University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing Post and Telecommunications University, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing Chemical University and five higher schools jointly launched the 2020 enrolment policy to eliminate professional differentials.
What is the significance of poor professional grades in voluntary filing?
There are three ways in which professional allocation rules can be applied.
Experts cautioned that before volunteering, it would be important to read more closely the School of Heartology's Charter of Admission, to understand the rules governing admission to higher education, including the slotting rate, the rules of professional assignment, etc.
The rules for the allocation of professions refer to the three modes of professional preference for admission to the profession after the transfer of the post-secondary level, with priority for the number of points, with a difference in the level of the profession.
Which way the university uses specifically will be specified in the Admissions Charter.
But there are also institutions of higher education where the overall priority is given, and there is no hierarchy between the professions.
This means that candidates within the range of admissions are queued according to the total score, and when the score does not reach the first professional voluntary entry score line, it depends on whether the second professional voluntary entry score line is reached, and so on until the last professional volunteer is accepted, and there is no difference between professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional grade differential" is one or more of the points published in the admission charter for the selection of candidates for the different specializations, which is the "professional grade difference".
That is to say, the difference in the scores of students enrolled in the first professional and non-first professional volunteering, and the difference in the grades of professional volunteers, e.g. 3 points, 2 points, 1 point.
For example.
Assuming that students from Ming Junior College of Higher Education had a total of 560 points, their professional volunteers were as follows: computers, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, professional admissions from A College of Higher Education were based on a system of professional differentials, with a score of 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, 0 points.
In the case of professional assignment, if the junior first professional volunteer meets the requirements for professional admission and has a planned professional balance, he is admitted to the "computer" profession; if the computer is not admitted, his score will be reduced by two points, with a 558 rating ranking of candidates for the "international trade" examination for the first professional voluntary examination, to determine whether the qualification for professional admission is met; if it is not met, the score will be reduced by one point (or 557) for the third professional voluntary "automated" admission; if it is still not met, the next professional will be reduced by one point (or 556 points) for admission to the fourth profession, and if it is still unable to meet its professional volunteering, it will no longer be reduced, and so on.
Different university-level differentials.
As parallel voluntary volunteers spread, many universities have now eliminated their professional differentials, but some of them have retained this method this year, with more than 20 universities having established their professional differentials, according to the "Application Charter" published by the respective universities.
For example, Sichuan University of Agriculture, Shandong University of Technology, Heilongjiang University of Central Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Teacher University, Chengdu School of Medicine, Northeast Electric University, American University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Industrial University, Ningxia University, Shandong Technical University, Chinese Civil Aviation Flight Institute, etc.
In these colleges, the differences of specialization are different at every university.
There are higher education institutions with grade differentials in each field, such as Ningxia University, where the files have been sent to candidates, in order of reduction of one point in the order in which candidates report their professional volunteering.
And some universities have different levels of specialization between different professions.
For example, the University of the United States, where the total difference in professional volunteer grades is 4 points, i.e., 3 points in first professional and 3 in other professional volunteer grades, no differences between other professional volunteers, considered parallel voluntary, and 1 point in other professional and transfer professional volunteer grades.
When reporting on a voluntary basis, candidates and parents must read carefully the admission policy of the reported school, see if there are any differences in the level of specialization, what the form of the grade is, and, while taking full account of the scores, should also make a sound analysis of the choice of school and profession. If institutions explicitly adopt a grade differential in their admission charters, when selecting a profession, they must pay attention to the gradient between the various professions and increase the rate of admission.

The first Atlantic hurricane this year landed in Texas, where the epidemic hit hard.
The National Hurricane Center of the United States announced in the morning that Hurricane Hanna had reached 145 kilometres per hour and was expected to cause heavy rains in southern Texas and north-eastern Mexico until next Monday, which could cause rapid flooding.
With the gradual movement towards land, customs have been reduced and, despite local power outages, there have been no reports of casualties.
Some local authorities in Texas are preparing to deal with the possibility of a tornado in the coastal zone.
On Twitter, President Trump stated that the Office was closely monitoring the dynamics of Hurricane Hanna and Hurricane Douglas in Hawaii and called on the population to listen to the emergency management information of the local government and to protect families and property.
At the same time, the state of Texas ' s new crown epidemic is rapidly worsening, with a rising number of infections, cumulatively more than 390,000 confirmed infections and more than 5,000 deaths.
In the wake of this hurricane, the Government will face the twin challenges of sheltering the homeless while preventing a further deterioration of the epidemic.
For the first time, an ad hoc committee was set up to sign a "long contract" for the third march to build an "advanced bond" - Xinhuanet.
The first meeting of the Alliance of Exhibitors of the Third Expo was filmed in Shanghai on 26 July.
On 26 July, the Xinhua Society in Shanghai (journalist Charry), for the first time, a professional committee was set up by the Union of Exhibitors of the Third Import Fair, the first of which included the Special Commission on Public Health against Disease and the Breast Industry, and 35 member enterprises signed a three-year long-term memorandum of cooperation on the exhibition, and the bonds of the Alliance are growing.
During the first meeting of the Alliance of Participants of the Third Exposition, held here on 26th, a three-year long-term memorandum of cooperation was signed by a group of exhibition members, such as South Korea Modern, United States Dow Chemical, Japan Capital Hall, New Zealand New Zealand, Siemens, France, Michelin, and Aslicom, United Kingdom, and the revised and refined Charter of the Alliance was also published for the first time.
On July 26th, the launch ceremony of the Specialized Board of the Breast Industry was taken in Shanghai.
According to the latest charter, the Alliance will introduce a lead unit rotation mechanism to enhance the functioning of the Panel.
The Panel will make recommendations for the analysis of trends in industry to promote sustainable industrial development.
At the same time, the consolidation of industry-wide chain resources, in order to be large and small, will lead to the participation of associated enterprises and will create a high ground for industry enterprises to gather.
The establishment of the Special Commission for the Prevention of Public Health was particularly important in the fight against the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
As Vice-President of the Special Commission on Public Health Prevention and Control at the 3rd Exposition, the General Manager of the Rapid Diagnostic Operations of the Great China District of Yape, Zhe Ping, said that the next step would be to work with more industry partners to explore new solutions and cooperation models to help China and the world fight the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
The inauguration ceremony of the Specialized Committee on Public Health against Disease, which was filmed in Shanghai on 26 July.
According to the information received, the 3rd Episode established for the first time a public health quarantine zone. To date, nearly 50 global companies have signed up for the exhibition, covering more than 10,000 square metres.
During the first Expo in 2018, the Alliance of Exhibition Participants was established by a voluntary initiative of the exhibitors to serve as a platform for high-quality business exchange and cooperation, linking the information- and resource-sharing platforms of the parties to the exhibition, and a think-tank platform to contribute to the promotion of trade and commerce and development between China and the countries of the world (the region).
To date, 142 enterprises have joined the Alliance of Exhibitors, covering 23 countries and regions around the world.
3-year-old Belgian girl died of new coronary virus infection - Xinhuanet
The Belgian health sector reported on 24 that a 3-year-old girl died of new coronary virus infection, the country ' s youngest new coronary disease.
The Belgian health-sector spokesman, Budwin Cateri, said that the girl had already had other serious diseases before she contracted the new coronary virus; in addition to the girl, an 18-year-old had recently died of the new coronary virus infection.
Katri said that 85 per cent of Belgium ' s new crowned personnel were under 60 years of age last week.
He reminds people of their health and the younger age not to take it lightly.
" Although young people die of new coronary virus infection less often, no one is immune... "
Last week, the number of new cases diagnosed in Belgium increased by 89 per cent compared to the previous week, with an average of 2.9 deaths per day from new coronary virus infections, up from 1.7 per day in the previous week.
During the peak of the European epidemic, the Belgian population accounted for the highest number of new coronary virus infections in Europe.
Belgium has a population of more than 11 million.
The latest data show that a cumulative number of 64,847 people in Belgium are infected with the new coronary virus.
Cartrie warned earlier this week that before the snowball rolls and eventually causes an avalanche, people have to act.
In an effort to curb the epidemic, the Prime Minister of Belgium, Sophie Villemes, announced on 23 March that the regulations governing the wearing of masks in public places would be stricter and that the programme for the further lifting of restrictive measures in August would be suspended.

Xinhua Society, Hong Kong, 25 July. Qiu Teng Hua, Director of the Department of Commerce and Economic Development of the Government of the Hong Kong SAR, stated on 25 July that all APEC member economies should act in concert to fight the disease and promote economic recovery and should refrain from creating unnecessary trade barriers in accordance with the rights and obligations established by the World Trade Organization.
Quintenghua made the above-mentioned statement at a televised meeting of trade ministers to combat the new coronary pneumonia epidemic organized by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) on 25th.
During the meeting, ministers exchanged views on the substantive options that APEC could take to respond to the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic and to promote economic recovery in the region.
Quintenghua said that the public health and economic crisis triggered by the epidemic had unprecedented far-reaching social and economic consequences.
"We are in a double battle, and we must defeat the epidemic before we can save the economy.
We want to have a clear goal that the virus is our common enemy, that cooperation will win, and that will only fail. "
Quintenghua says that the new coronary pneumonia epidemic has led to a series of trade restrictions that help to control the epidemic.
Trade is the key solution to the current problem and should not be seen as a problem.
He condemned all policy measures that were discriminatory and divisive and urged all economies to remain open to borders at this critical time, maintain the smooth functioning of supply chains and avoid creating trade barriers or adopting irrational trade policies.
Four hundred and forty-four thousand new crown cases have been diagnosed in the State of Metropolis.
On July 26th, Sino-News reported a comprehensive report, according to the United States Johns Hopkins University website, as of about 8.34 p.m. Beijing time, more than 414,000 new cases of confirmed diagnosis had been reported in Florida, over 411,000 in New York, the second largest epidemic in the United States since California.
The Florida Department of Health reported on 25 that 124 deaths were reported in Florida on 24th.
This is the tenth death toll in Florida since the beginning of the new coronary.
The total number of reported cases in Miami Deed County, the most affected country in Florida, is over 100,000.
There are currently 8974 new coronary patients in Florida, of which 1874 are in Miami Deed.
Since 4 July, there has been a 79 per cent increase in the number of new coronary admissions in the state.
Since the reopening of the first state of the United States on 24 April, 91,000 lives have been taken from the new crown.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the total number of confirmed consultations in the United States has reached 4,176,000, with at least 146,000 deaths.
The police stopped people from "seeming too happy"
In response to the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, China announced the closure of the United States Consulate General in Chengdu this Friday.
On Saturday, the consulate's badge was removed, and on Sunday, a dark glass car drove out of the consulate in the passman's booing.
On Sunday, a lot of Chengdu people were standing in front of the consulate, and people who had never been here were driven by curiosity.
The Agence France-Presse station reporter went to observe it near the Consulate in Chengdu, where he reported that curious people were in constant contact, and that there were many parents who took their children to the Consulate for a walk, photographed the building, or photographed themselves.
The consulate is surrounded by guards, and the police sometimes "right" people behave, and they don't seem to allow any appearance: a woman was stopped just after she started singing red songs, and a guard confiscated a banner.
