The report published by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 26 January states that Iran has begun to use advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, in further violation of the nuclear agreement reached with the world ' s major Powers in 2015.
According to the IAEA report, the advanced centrifuge at Iran 's Natanz Nuclear Facility "is accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium " .
Since President Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement last May and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the nuclear agreement reached with the major Powers in 2015.
According to the agreement, Iran can only extract uranium from the first generation of IR-1 centrifuges.
The other signatories to this agreement, the United Kingdom, China, France, Germany and Russia, have been trying to save it, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
According to the Japan Commons Agency, in the afternoon of 25 local time, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigeaki held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in New York, where he visited, confirming that the conclusion of negotiations on a peace treaty covering the four northern islands (the disputed islands of Japan and Russia, known as the " four northern islands " , and Russia as the " South Korean Islands " ) and the development of relations between the two countries in a wide range of political, economic and other areas, and that the two sides also agreed to coordinate his early visit to Russia.
This was the first Russian consultation since Shigeki took office as Minister for Foreign Affairs and as head of the negotiations for the conclusion of a peace treaty.
Moki expressed to the Russian side that " including the promotion of joint economic activity (on the four northern islands) in the hope of effective consultation " ...
According to the Government of Japan, the talks did not discuss the Territory in detail.
At the Russian summit meeting in December 2018, it was confirmed that the Foreign Ministers of the two countries, in their capacity as leaders, were in a position to accelerate negotiations.
At this meeting, the Foreign Ministers of the two countries welcomed the progress made in the consultations on joint economic activities in the field of tourism and waste disposal.
Shigeki expressed his expectation that the tourism pilot operation scheduled for October would " hopefully be successfully implemented, leading to the next step ... "
In addition, the meeting confirmed that Lavrov would coincide with the meeting of the G-20 Foreign Ministers in Nagoya in November.

The women's column is expected to defend the World Cup early!
On 27th, in the fight against the Dutch women's row, the Chinese team was brought back to the city with two games in a row, and ended up winning at 3:1 in a row.
The World Cup is nearing its end, but in the face of the Serbian team, the Chinese women's ranks are still indifferent.
In the first two games with the Netherlands, the Chinese female platoons were as strong as ever. They went down two cities at 25:19, 25:16, until the third round, when the team suffered a setback.
The Dutch women have increased the aggressiveness of serving the ball while they are lagging behind, and the Chinese team has been hit and, in addition, the girls have begun to attack and their mistakes have increased, leading to their return to the city at 21:25.
In an interview he also said: " Third round, we sent about eight points because of a mistake... "
Of course, the Dutch women's ranks were indisputably well prepared before the Chinese women's rows, and despite losing a game, everything was still in the hands of Ruo Ping. " It's normal to win and win with the strong, and it's normal to win five, so we said to the players, " I said so.
In the fourth round, the players are actively adjusting, Chang Changning is on fire, the single game is eight points, and he's doing his best for the team.
To date, 11 rounds of confrontation have only two rounds left, and while one of the Chinese women has already touched the championships, it did ring a warning bell to the Chinese women in the contest against the Dutch team: the more critical it is, the harder it will be.
In another game on 27th, the Russian and American women's rows were full of five games, and the United States team was not able to score all three points from each other, so that the Chinese women's rows would be able to achieve the crown in an early round by taking all three points against Serbia.
Everything's moving towards a situation favourable to the Chinese women's platoon.
However, although the Serbian team has lost all of its power, this does not mean that they will give three cents to the Chinese team.
In the form of the current scoreboard, the Serbian team has virtually no medal, which means that they can " lightly " in the competition against the Chinese women ' s platoons, put down their burdens and hit their opponents with full force, while the Chinese team is under pressure to win, and the state is likely to rise and fall.
Moreover, the replacement of the Serbian team, which was not the lamb of "one man to slaughter" before the war with the Dutch team, was fought five times, and the Serbian team eventually reversed the Dutch all-embracing position by 3:2 and thus the depth of its strength.
Before the third stage of the game, Rang Ping also said that neither team would be able to deal with it: " The match in Osaka will be very difficult, and we have to prepare carefully... "
Now that the horns of the coronary have been blown, the competition has really entered the "white heat stage."
In terms of strength, the Chinese women are above their opponents, but only at the last moment, and it is up to the girls to be able to play their normal role and free themselves in the game.

On September 24th, a boat ticket showed me a show of love for the disabled at the Grand Sha Orange, where more than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to the Orange Starship to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China.
Most of the more than 100 people with disabilities who participated in the event were on the cruise ship for the first time.
Zhao Zhengang, 56 years old, is a crippled man. He rarely leaves the house because he can't handle his feet.
He said: " For the first time in a cruise ship today, it's very exciting to appreciate the vastness of the river, to feel the development pulse of Changsha... " .
Volunteers from the Fukuoka Social Work Centre and the Blue Sky Rescue Team in Changsa City provided sophisticated services to persons with disabilities.
Especially for clients with severe physical disabilities, volunteers will carry them up and down the liner.
According to the relevant head of the Fukuoka Social Work Centre, over the past 70 years, with the support of the party and the Government, the cause of persons with disabilities in Changsha City has continued to progress, with an increasing number of persons with disabilities becoming genuine participants in socio-economic development, contributors and beneficiaries, caring for and assisting persons with disabilities, and caring to support the cause of persons with disabilities becoming a social consensus.
The Republic is celebrating its seventieth anniversary, and the spotlights of the media on all roads are glittering so much that we don't remember so much, and it's them that bring heat and light to our bright days.
However, if a hero walks around, it looks like you're like me.
Yuan Yongping, a leading scientist who has been so eager to make China ' s "eyes" angry, a man, a pot, a lifetime, and one thing, eating cold buns in the mountains of Guizhou and not much like the old man in the castle; Zhou Chang, a red scientist, a young village boy, who is still like a son, learning from the middle west, with a white hair in the middle, who says he's going to the heart, who likes to laugh; Qin-yi, a red movie artist who's been in the middle of the sky, who's aged 90, who's still in the middle of the highlands and who's still happy to play an old maid who doesn 't know her name...
They live simple, pure and committed, and they are easily happy, unfavorable, rich and proud, as long as they are immersed in the unconscionable and self-serving cause of the outsiders.
It's like in the golden novels that Shaolin Temple, the monk of Shizuku, has no joy, no joy and no sadness.
Every "scathing monk", every heart of a son, has a country that belongs to me and whoever it is.
Our country is not only on the shoulders of heroes, but also in the hands of hundreds of thousands of people.
Once, a high school girl was turned crazy by a friend of the Internet, " When a hero passes, someone has to sit by the side of the road... and I don ' t want to be a hero, I want to be a person by the side of the road... "
Actually, it's not a contradiction to be a hero and to applaud a hero.
The people who applaud on the side of the road are also passing heat and light, and they're also glowing.
As you are me, there are opportunities in life, and there are moments, and there is a accumulation of days, and there is the shape of heroes.
Judge Zou Beihua of Shanghai, who bears the burden of judicial reform, has put on stage his own story at the annual conference, sent numerous newspaper letters a year, never wrong, " doing the simple thing right is not simple " , and the judges of Zoo Beihua gave their applause to the old "Screen of the Land."
It's between heroes. It's a hero who applauds another hero.
The monks have Shaolin temples, Yuan Yongping has vast rice experimental fields, Nan In-dong has Sky-Eye, Qin-yi has a stage, Zhou Chang has a platform to be a hero, not only on his own, but also on the basis of a good environment and positive incentives.
China SkyEye, for example, is now a myth.
In the 1990s, the Chinese scientific community was struggling to climb, and the novelist Liu Xi-Hin has yet to write "The Three."
At that time, the greatest "eye" was the one-sided radio telescope in the valley of Puerto Rico Island — Arecibo, 350 metres in diameter — considered to be the world's most inexorable.
The Chinese radio telescope at that time was less than one tenth in diameter.
But Nan In-dong, who enjoys world-class scientific conditions and salaries in Japan, insisted on returning home, bringing back an almost crazy idea: to build a new generation of radio telescopes in China to receive more messages from outer space!
China's a waste of time.
The country believes in Nan In-dong and the "Eye of Heaven" project has begun.
It's been 12 years. It's been 9 years since the project came into being.
Open the 500-metre-caliber sky-eye, and China does what there is no precedent for, " the world ' s unique big science project " .
So, the Eye of Heaven is great, the South In-dongs are great, they're big, they're great, they're high-profile republics.
With the trust of the nation, the goodwill of the people, the opportunity for the Southern In-dongs to become the living spirit of the nation.
A country with young talent, a white-haired hero walking by, a country where people applaud lightly on the side of the road, it's beautiful and harmonious.
Garbage class education begins in Jilin kindergarten, and environmentalism begins with dolls.
On 27th, a classification of waste education course was conducted in a kindergarten in Jilin city, Jilin province, where young children were taught to identify recyclable waste and other types of waste.
It is known that this is the first time a garbage tax has been introduced into a local early childhood education class.
Today, nine departments of Jilin Province jointly launched the " Work Programme for the Promotion of Classification of Land-based Urban Waste in Jilin Province " .
In 2019, on the basis of the pilot of the compulsory classification of waste from life in Changchun City, the province decided to carry out the classification of waste from life in local cities.
Gilling City is one of them.
Through this event, we hope to achieve a family-led, child-friendly society-driven approach that promotes the concept of environmental protection.
The executive director of Fannie International Kindergarten, Liu Lijun, said,
On the same day, the director read an environmental initiative, hoping that garbage would start with the children.
After the low-carbon bell dance, the kids grouped up for a little garbage sorting game.
The tutors also issued the "Recoverable Other Trash" label and advised the children to stick the label to the trash bin and make a little video when they came home.
Liu Lijun introduced the idea of a low-carbon, green and environmentally friendly kindergarten, with regular environmental workshops.
There's a classable trash can at the dump in the park, and it's marked with the type of dropout.
Teacher taught the kids what recycling garbage is.
According to preliminary statistics, in 2018, Jilin Province produced approximately 54,652 tons of municipal waste, all of which went to the disposal yard for disposal.
Of this total, 3.292 million tons of sanitary landfills, 2.0923 million tons in incineration, and 80.1 million tons in integrated processes.
After many years of efforts, the province ' s municipalities and counties have the capacity to treat their waste in a harmless manner.
The programme of work for the classification and treatment of waste in local cities in Jilin province, which has been launched, specifically calls for further activities to be carried out, such as the classification of waste in schools, the introduction of educational materials, the introduction of classrooms, the promotion of interaction between students and parents through the creation of songs, songs, cartoons, micro-videos, etc., with the effect of "raising a child, influencing a family, bringing a community, raising a new generation".
According to data released on 27 September in Malaysia, the global volume of sales in August was 117,715.
Sales in China declined by 21 per cent due to the impact of the under-infusion of new vehicles and the reduction of prices.
Japan's domestic sales fell by 6%, and the demand for the last bus before the consumption tax increased in October was limited.
In August, Malaysia sold 17,729 vehicles in China.
August 2018 was also 13% lower than the previous year, and sales continued to decline.
The sale of China's dedicated main force, SUV "CX-4" has been reduced by 14%.
"CX-4" has been on the market for a long time since 2016 and the effect of the new car has declined.
Reductions in prices as a result of strategies to improve brand value from a long-term perspective are also known to have a significant impact on sales.
The sales of Malaysia in the United States grew by 7% over the same period, reaching 27482 and growing by 14 months.
In August, salesmen's business days were one more day than in the previous year, together with "strength promotions such as publicity" (Madida), which led to an increase in sales by SUV "CX-5".
Japanese domestic sales fell by 6% to 14422.
According to the company, the emergency purchase before the tax increase was not as high as it was last time (2014) " .
There's a reduction in sales of cars like "Demio."
The death of Chirac and the perpetuation of the political legacy.
On 26 local time, former French President Chirac died long ago, and he was 86 years old.
At a time when the world is in the midst of a century of great changes, the many political legacy that the French politician left when he came to power in that year is still worthy of our praise.
He was President of France for 12 years in a very personal way.
He inherited the diplomatic spirit of de Gaulle independence and a strong support for European integration, representing the pursuit of the European Dream.
At the same time, he has been a strong advocate of multipolarism and multilateralism in the world as a strategic statesman.
That's why the French media rate him as "the great representative of France on the world stage".
One of the great political decisions of Chirac is to oppose the American-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France, together with Germany, took the pressure of the United States and took the lead against the war.
A year after the war, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to increased terrorist activity and make the world even more dangerous.
Later on, it turns out that Chirac's warning was correct.
In the midst of European integration, where unilateralism in the United States is becoming more pronounced, the strategic thinking and decision of Chirac on international political and global affairs is undoubtedly very enlightening.
Chirac is also a French politician who is familiar and friendly to the Chinese.
He was one of the champions and creators of the Golden Decade of China-France relationship, which, after his first election as President of France in 1995, was driven by statesman's strategy.
In 2004, China established a comprehensive strategic partnership and China entered a completely new phase of bilateral engagement.
Bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly during Chirac ' s administration, and cooperation between the two countries in various areas, such as aviation, nuclear energy and rail transport, has made breakthrough progress.
The Mid-French Cultural Year of the Chirac Initiative created a completely new model of cultural exchange in the history of China.
Chirac's whole life has been particularly impressive for Chinese culture.
According to his Chinese diplomat, Chirac can carry Li Bai, some poems from Tov and even accurately judge the history of China's bronze apparatus.
"Don't look at the pyramids as if they've actually been to Egypt or Qin as if they've been to China" – a gold phrase that comes from Chirac.
" The West has concerns about China ' s political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China ' s economic growth, and China ' s political status at the international level ...
But I have confidence in China myself.
I believe that China, a country with a long history of civilization, has sufficient experience to help it build up ideas and values for harmonious development and to shoulder its responsibilities in the world stage for a long time ... "
I also believe that the revival of China will bring new creativity to the world culture and enrich it.
The people have gone, but the political legacy and inspiration that Chirac left to the world will survive.

Members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have joined forces against the United States-Related Ports Act
In a joint statement of 27 members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Council expressed strong opposition to the adoption of the Hong Kong Bill of Human Rights and Democracy of 2019 by both chambers of the United States Congress.
This statement, which was co-sponsored by 40 members of Parliament, states that Hong Kong's rights are currently conferred by the Basic Law of the HKSAR, including the maintenance of the status of free trade ports and separate customs zones, the conclusion and implementation of bilateral and multilateral agreements in various fields, including the economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture and sports, in the name of Hong Kong, China, with different countries and regions of the world.
These rights are not exercised by any foreign government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always done a great deal by strictly adhering to international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, engaging in business with different countries and regions, and engaging in cooperation in a wide range of related fields.
The statement stated that the adoption of the bill by the United States Senate and the Foreign Council was unnecessary, but rather a means of responding to the calls of its corrupt agents, as a means of gross interference in Hong Kong ' s internal affairs and of securing political leverage for its agents in Hong Kong.
The members of the Legislature expressed their deep regret and strong opposition to this move by the United States.
The statement states that Hong Kong is an important trading partner and the largest source of trade surplus in the United States.
Hong Kong ' s good rule of law, a fair and free business environment and a clean society make it a good place for American businessmen to run business.
If the United States adopts this bill, it will add to China's relationship without any benefit and harm to others, in addition to attacking the interests of Hong Kong and the United States itself.
The statement states that Hong Kong will, as in the past, remain unswervingly committed to the "one country, two systems" approach and will continue to enjoy the rights and fulfil its obligations under the Basic Law.
In the past, now and in the future, Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and to international trade and commerce.
According to the 26th of the European Times, the two chambers of the French Parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week.
The French President, Markron, recently claimed that France could not " embrace everyone " , but at the same time it had to try to " properly accept " .
According to reports, Markron is trying to find a compromise route in immigration matters to mitigate the upcoming debate.
In a recent interview with the United States in New York during the general debate of the General Assembly, Markron expressed the hope that there would be a real two-pronged approach to immigration policy that would strike a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
Markron said: " If France wishes to receive (immigrants) properly, it cannot accept everyone " .
Markron identified four priorities of the immigration policy: granting asylum to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; more efficient integration of migrants; reception and protection of all migrants entering French territory; and more efficient resettlement of those who entered France illegally and were not fit to stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the AME system is the subject of most discussion in the past.
Markron said he wanted to be able to "assess" the system, but not eliminate it, but limit it to a certain extent.
After Markron's statement, the extreme right leader of the National Union Le Pompey wrote that Markron's statement was "no talk."
Right-wing Republicans, President of the Senate Rasher, also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a "reduced" but " confronted with reality" way, indirectly criticizing Markron.
The leftist Socialist Congressman Valau believes that France should "take more and better " on immigration and criticize Markron for "wiping" the subject.
Reports indicate that the new version of the Law on Asylum and Immigration has been in force for one year, which has led to differences of opinion within the ruling party, but at the same time has failed to appease the right-wing opposition.
In the next 2022 election, immigration policy will again be the focus of extreme right-wing attacks, and Markron will need to do something about it, but will also risk irritating left-wing elements within the ruling party.
It is reported that the lower house of the French National Assembly will be debating immigration policy on 30 September and the Senate on 2 October.
There are indications that Chinese A shares are on the backslide, and many listed companies are taking back real silver shares.
According to the financial data service provider's eastern wealth statistics, the total amount of A shares repurchased in 2019 was over 100 billion yuan (RM, RM), far more than in the same period in previous years, creating a record high of A shares repurchase capital.
In response, Mr. Xuyang, Chairman of the Shanghai McCorn Information Consulting Limited, said that the lower overall valuation of the A share market this year, the repurchase of shares at relatively low prices, would help listed companies to increase the efficiency of their use of funds, and reflect the willingness of listed companies to manage market value markets and good cash flows, which would boost investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the stock buy-back system has encouraged listed companies to actively engage in stock buy-backs.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued implementing rules for the repurchase of shares by listed companies, providing detailed rules and guidelines for repurchase of shares by listed companies.
Also according to media statistics, since this year, listed companies that have implemented a buy-back programme have been concentrated in the capital sector, the real estate sector, the information technology sector and the electronics manufacturing industry.
In addition, six listed companies bought more than $1 billion this year in terms of repurchase payments.
The first of these is the Elie shares, which buys back more than $5 billion.
What is the impact of stock buybacks by listed companies on the market?
In an interview with a Chinese News Agency journalist, the Vice-President of the Finance and Finance Institute of the People ' s University of China, Zhao Xi Jun, stated that repurchases showed, on the one hand, that listed companies had a stronger economic power and a better financial position and were capable of maintaining stable stock prices and giving confidence to investors; on the other hand, that listed companies and their controlling shareholders were accountable to companies, to markets and to investors.
The former is based on good corporate performance, while the latter requires a high quality of listed companies and their controlling shareholders.
For capital markets, it's the core building blocks.
Stock buybacks by listed companies boost investor confidence and support stock prices by listed companies.
Also according to the Eastern Securities Research, based on projected stock buybacks from A stock listings as a whole since the beginning of this year, and on the return purchase of stock on average, this year ' s repurchase of stocks is expected to bring an increase of $150 billion to the A stock market.
It took almost two months for the National Focus Unit to complete its work on the restoration of the Post-Tian Sanctuary Monuments, which will be reopened this year during the National Day.
It's a big traditional mural that reflects mother's life as a whole.
With the approval of the competent State authorities, it was drawn from 1991 to 1994 by Chief Choi Chang-kyu, former civilian museum in Tianjin.
It is known that this mural is painted south of the palace, full 32 metres long and 2.6 metres high on the north wall, two parts high up and down, with the birth of the day, the sea crossing, and more than 30 stories of the benevolent rise of the sky, and 358 objects rediscovering the life of the mother.
Tsai Chang-kyu explained that, in recent years, the summer of Tianjin and the dry winter caused the mural to break, which accounted for 60% of the entire mural area.
In order to protect and save the murals of Mom's ancestors, the Council for the Aurremation of the Congregation of Cultures and the House of Queens began work on the restoration of the palaces and the interiors of the palaces in Tianjin City.
The restoration project was led by Choi Chang-kyu and involved four prominent national painters.
The restoration work was based on the principle of “renovation as old as old”, while also adapting the original mural to local content, adding to the original imperfection of the mural.
In the process of repair, we've also made innovations and attempts in color, materials, pen ink, etc.
After the repairs, the original murals were preserved, spiritual, spiritual and artistic.
The Palace was established in 1326, the formerly known as the House of Princesses, which has undergone numerous renovations, is one of the oldest buildings in the city of Tianjin and one of the oldest temples in China ' s current age.
On September 25th, the launch ceremony of Beijing Dae-hing International Airport took place.
The design of the Beijing Da Hing International Airport terminal called "The Phoenix Shower" is known as the first of the seven wonders of the new world.
Beijing Capital International Airport is currently overloaded with 100 million passengers last year, becoming the second year of global traffic of hundreds of millions of passengers after Atlanta Airport in the United States.
By 2022, Beijing Daes International Airport is expected to have 45 million passengers and 20 per cent of international flights; by 2025, 72 million passengers are expected to have swallowed up and 30 per cent of international flights are expected to take place.
How cool is it as the New Kingdom door?
Beijing Dae-hing International Airport, located between Beijing City and Guangyang City, Hebei Province, is 46 km from Tiananmen, the largest newly constructed airport in the world.
The surface projection of the roof of its terminal with steel structures amounted to 180,000 square metres, with 25 standard football fields.
Beijing Daes International Airport is the world's first air terminal with two arrival and two departure levels — F1-F4 international, domestic, domestic, international.
F3, F4 – International departures, both domestic and domestic.
Beijing Da Hing International Airport's first voyage opened the era of the two airports in Beijing.
The new airport has been established as a large international aviation hub, and the country has developed new sources of power to support the integrated regional transport hub in Kyoto, built in the area of Yu An. To date, 66 airlines have been interested in entering Beijing Daesing International Airport, including 20 domestic airlines, 46 Hong Kong, Aotearoa and foreign airlines, and airlines have been authorized at any given time.
During the 2019 winter and spring season, Beijing Daes International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, of which 101 are domestic and 15 are international; it covers 112 global points, including 97 national and 15 international.
This has resulted in a coordinated development with the Beijing Capital International Airport, with moderate competition and a "two-hub" airport pattern with international first-class competitiveness, which has eased the pressure on the capital's airport to operate in saturated capacity and better met the urgent need for rapid growth in air transport in and around Beijing and has effectively enhanced the international competitiveness of our civil aviation industry.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daes International Airport takes due account of its geographical location, its relationship to the surrounding airspace and operating environment. For the first time in the country, the airport runways have adopted a "all-way" layout, the world's largest automated air traffic system and the establishment of China's largest terminal control area, which maximizes aviation efficiency.
For the first time in a domestic airport of this size, an automated national baggage processing and information management system was used to improve the efficiency of baggage processing using innovative baggage transfer models.
Beijing Da Hing International Airport's first voyage is a sign of the phoenix flying.
This new airport, which has created more than 40 international, national and national production rates of more than 98 per cent, will have a direct and indirect economic impact on the surrounding industries and will inject an impending dynamism into Beijing ' s economic development.
Marv is scheduled to hold a general meeting in November, to be transferred to the Party until 16 years of age.
Marv is tentatively scheduled to convene a central congress in early November to amend the party's transfer under the party charter to 16 years of age.
With Congress passing down the voting age for general elections, Ma Wah announced the 66th Central Congress this year, proposing amendments to the party's charter, including a downward adjustment to the membership age of Mawar, from the current 18 to 16 years.
The Governor General of Ma Wah said that the Central Congress was scheduled to be held on 2 and 3 November this year, but that the date of the Congress might change as a result of the by-election of the Danish-Ai seat.
He said that, since the Election Commission would meet only on 1 October to finalize the nomination date for the by-election and the date of the ballot for the Danish-Ai seat, they would meet the following day, 2 October, to discuss whether to change the date of this year ' s Central Congress.
He also explained that the purpose of the Chinese Committee held yesterday (26th) was to finalize the date of the congress and to amend the party's charter, but only to happen to have happened to the tragic death of Congressman Tango Mohamfari of the Indigenous Unity Party and thus to be on the agenda for the by-election of the country.
H.E. Mr. Wang Xiang, Secretary of the Cantonal Committee, Shandong Xinqiang — The rich people of Keung County, Akiko Xinhua Network
Wang Guoxiang, born February 1943, worked in 1967 and served as secretary of the Commune Party, county committee secretary, mayor, etc.
In 1986, Wang Xiang was the secretary of the County Committee for Su-kang in Shandong Province, which was a poor district in the village.
During five years of his tenure, Uncle Wang focused his efforts on three things: the promotion of vegetable industry; the development of saline beaches in Subei; and the building of the foundations of industry, from which the salinists have grown their pockets and raised their waistboards.
Life farmers have a tradition of vegetables and lessons of growing them.
At the beginning of the 1980s, life farmers could not grow a good harvest and rot in the ground.
Uncle Cheung found out that the key to catching vegetables is to make it flow.
Lifelight was the first to set up a wholesale market for vegetables and set the stage for the development of a market economy.
Party cadres take the lead, screw it up, and lose everything in the county.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Po-Xiang, 17 members of the 3-dollar village of Yu-Yu-Yi-Yu-Yu-Yi-Yu-Yu-Yu-Yu-Yu-Yi set up 17 warm winter vegetables sheds, and 17 " double-million-dollar households " emerged from the village in that year.
The county has since set up a promotion group, which, with Wang's mobilization, has guided Wang Loi in various townships; in the first year more than 5,000 vegetable sheds have been promoted, after which the vegetable sheds have moved to the whole county and to the whole country.
For hundreds of years, 1.6 million acres of land in Subei, apart from salty beaches, were painted on shallow beaches.
It's hard for the local people to live in.
Soo-nam has a vegetable shed. What about Su-bei?
Wang Po-Xiang organized a war with 100,000 people, camped on a deserted beach for 40 or 50 days.
Wang and the county leaders were living on the ground, pushing cars and loads like civilian workers, living in a place where the people saw them stretching their thumbs and admired them......at that time, Subei developed 150,000 acres of shrimp ponds, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, and developed a collection pot on salty beaches.
In July 1986, Wang Pak Xiang participated for the first time in the industrial conference of the city in his capacity as county secretary.
In the course of the meeting, a comparative table of industrial economy figures in the 12th Prefectural District was distributed, which, at first glance, shows the value of industrial output, and life expectancy is good, ranking fourth.
But if we take off the salt, we'll have $119 million of pure industrial output left in life, third to the bottom.
Uncle Wang took over 70 men to get out of the country to change his mind.
Less than a year back, the county invested $150 million in 77 projects.
Every year since then, we've organized the Echelon to Shenzhen, Togashi and Shanghai.
Life's short of business, less of an entrepreneur.
Wang Po-Xiang chaired a panel on the theme: public selection of the director of the factory throughout the county, with 40 "careable people" out of sight, pushed to industry.
In 1991, his birthday came into the ranks of 100 counties across the country, and Wang was transferred as Deputy Mayor of the city.
He left behind more than 200,000 vegetable sheds, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, 4854 businesses, more than 100,000 " 10,000 dollar households " , a cadre recognized by the people.
On 26 September, local time, the Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi chaired the meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of China and the African States members of the Security Council at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Côte d ' Ivoire, of which Africa is currently a member of the Security Council, Oyono, of Equatorial Guinea, Pandor, of South Africa, and Carla, of Niger, which is a member of the Security Council, and Jeshenawi, who is a member of Tunisia.
Wang I put forward four proposals to strengthen cooperation between the two sides in the Council.
First of all, it's about uniting.
The greatest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, with the direct consequence that the basic norms of international relations are being challenged and that the role of the United Nations is being undermined to the detriment of the interests of a large number of developing countries and small and medium-sized States, including African States.
Meeting this challenge will require hands-on, shoulder-to- shoulder-to-hand, unity.
In this Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, and the weight of focus is not just three votes, but the continent as a whole.
China and Africa stand together, not just four votes, but will lead others to follow up, influence and shape the Council ' s agenda.
Since 2018, China has established a 3+1 coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council, which should be fully utilized.
Second, it's through negotiation.
China has always advocated a political solution to hotspot issues. Africa has a good tradition of consultation, as well as the experience of successful good offices of African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex problems on the Council ' s agenda, particularly Africa ' s hotspots, are mostly the root causes of colonialism, and some are directly related to external factors.
We will work together on Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and on the role of the United Nations in good offices, mediation, etc.
Third, self-help.
African countries and peoples know best about Africa ' s problems, and Africa has the capacity and the wisdom to solve its own problems.
In addressing Africa ' s hotspots, the Council should focus on listening to and respecting Africa ' s will, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa ...
China stands ready to strengthen coordination with the African side and to firmly advance capacity-building for African-owned peace operations.
And fourthly, development cures the fundamentals.
China and the African countries in general are developing countries, and we will insist on placing economic and social development first and supporting each other in their chosen development path.
China is ready to build a "one way and the other " with the AU Agenda 2063 " , the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda 2030, which is closely aligned with the development strategies of African countries and helps African countries to strengthen their capacity for development and address the root causes of conflict.
We will work together to promote greater United Nations investment in Africa's development.
With the resurgence of the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, China has been and will continue to do its utmost to provide the necessary human and material assistance and is ready to coordinate its efforts with African countries to mobilize greater assistance from, among others, the United Nations, WHO and to play the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The relays of the Neonatal Section and others save small lives.
I'm in danger!
The second pregnant mother had an early onset, and on her way to the hospital in a panic, a 32-week premature baby was born in his father's car.
Fortunately, obstetric and neonatal doctors handled it in a timely manner, and the relay saved this little life.
By coincidence, on 19, 20, 21 days, the obstetric and neonatal unit of the Maternal and Child Health Care Institute in Hubei province received three premature births on its way for three days, the other two were born in a 120-car, 29-week period.
Ms. Cheng was a second-born mother, and at 7 a.m. on September 19th, she had a stomach ache, thought she was 32 weeks pregnant, and the first birth was premature, and she packed up the waiting items and went straight to the hospital after taking a bath.
After 9:30, Ms. Cheng packed up and let her husband drive from his home to the hospital.
I didn't expect the baby to be born on Dad's sidekick shortly after the car left the house.
Twenty minutes later, Ms. Cheng and the baby finally arrived at the Gynaecology and Obstetrics Building at the Maternal and Child Health Home in Hubei Province.
Hospital security officers saw the troubled couple and the baby and immediately informed the maternity ward that four doctors and midwives were waiting for Dr. Zhang Qing and Ms. Liu Yan-yan, with a birth bag and a umbilical cord, were going downstairs.
"At the time, the mother lay half on the side of the car, under the water of sheep and blood, and a boy was next to him, with a umbilical cord... "
Zhang Qing asked about the baby as a 32-week premature birth, the parents had not been able to cover the children on their way, the morning of the first fall was cold, his skin was pale, he didn't cry, his limbs were soft.
Ms. Liu went to the co-pilot to deal with the baby's umbilical cords, and Zhang came in from the cab, opened the delivery bag quickly, wrapped the baby a few layers of warmth with the towels and the package, and cleaned the respiratory tract for the newborn, then carried the baby up to the 12th floor neonatal section.
The newborn doctor came to the nurse's station to rescue the pre-born baby as soon as he heard.
At that time, the baby had a purple face and was suffocated with oxygen, and the doctor put him in a tube. In less than a minute, the baby recovered, and the skin color gradually recovered, and the recovery was successful.
Upon admission, this 32-week baby got into a breathing machine, sustained rescue, breathing calmly, successfully evacuated the next day.
After a week of treatment, the baby's vital signs are stable, breathing is smooth, and a small amount of breastfeeding has begun.
By coincidence, on 19, 20, 21 days in a row, the maternity and neonatal unit of the hospital received three premature births on its way for three days, while the other two were born in 120 first aid vehicles, all of which were 29 weeks old, and are currently active in neonatal care.
The obstetric director of the provincial maternal and child health centre, Sun Guoqiang, introduced the fact that, in recent years, mothers and children had received a number of visits to babies born on subways in private cars, which could threaten the lives of mothers and children.
Director Sun warned that pregnant mothers should visit the hospital as soon as they had a stomachache, broken water, and seen red, etc.
In case she is in the house or on the way, the mother should be able to sleep as flatly as possible, with blankets on her buttocks and so on, so as to prevent the baby from falling into the back of the ground, and the child should be warmed up as soon as possible, so that she can be brought to the hospital.

"Trudo's Collapse." Can he succeed in his second term?
This time, Trudo tripped out of the big pit, and it was Trudo himself who dug it up a little bit.
In recent days, the Canadian media have exposed several old pictures of the current Prime Minister, Trudo, who dressed himself as a black person.
This is considered to be a clear act of racial discrimination that triggers a wave in Canada.
After what happened, Trudo apologized repeatedly to the public.
However, Canadians don't buy much.
Trudo broke his feet with a rock.
As the political commentator Riley and others have pointed out, since the rise of the anti-black-face movement in the United States, Trudo and the Federal Liberal Party have been high-profile in accusing opposition parties or dissidents within the party of " losing their fortunes " in this regard, and have repeatedly said, "Anyone who makes this mistake should be dismissed immediately " .
Simply put, this trip to Trudo's big hole, it's just Trudo's own little dig.
Trudo was the son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudo of Canada, a young and handsome man, who shaved the cyclone of political idols when he was out.
He was a political figure who, after taking over as head of the Federal Liberal Party, fought an unexpectedly beautiful battle in the Canadian federal legislative elections of 2015 — the Federal Liberal Party, which was half in the lower court of the Federation and gained valuable separate powers.
At that time, Trudo presented a number of platforms for deafening politics, such as " Ethnicity and Gender Equality " , " Ecological Environment " , " Economic Revitalization " , emphasizing the eradication of corruption and the "unfair wind".
However, for five years in power, he has been " high and low " in almost all of the above-mentioned areas.
In terms of "ethnicity and gender equality", leaving aside the "black-face" incident, he "didn't talk" about a series of Aboriginal issues, which led First Nations groups, leaders, to move protest tents to the gates of the Hills of Congress on the 150th anniversary of the founding of Canada.
In the fight against corruption, at the end of last year, Trudo was involved in the tumultuous "Ranving" incident.
It was exposed to a major private fraud case involving the construction and engineering company "Lan Wanling" in its home country, putting pressure on the department and officials responsible for the investigation to "excellently respect your hand " .
And, instead, Trudo moved on to the officer who disclosed the malpractice after the incident, who was the first to disclose the malpractice when the case was directly handled by the Attorney-General of Canada.
Even though the case itself is questionable, it's hard to get rid of the suspicion.
According to many observers, the collapse of the Trudo regime for five years was largely due to its own "pitching pits", and the biggest pits were the "dumps" and "eat their own fruit" and "better than their duel".
Canada ' s most authoritative Angus-Reed poll data show that, from 2015 to the present, those who supported Trudo slid from more than 60 per cent to more than 30 per cent, while opponents jumped from less than 30 per cent to more than 60 per cent.
Despite the fact that other opposition parties and their party leaders have performed similarly poorly, even a significant proportion of the voters who are willing to vote for the Federal Liberal Party are now the Federation Prime Minister, and the ruling party leader is not convinced.
On 21 October, when the new Canadian federal legislative elections were about to begin, would Trudo be able to repeat the triumph of five years ago?
The answer might be one word: hard.
Whether at the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience or regional aviation integration, the development integration dimension of Kyoto is far-reaching and positive.
On September 25th, Beijing Daecheng International Airport officially sailed.
New Kyoto journalists have been informed by the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission that the capital airport is operating in a state of oversaturation and that the opening of the international airport will enhance the capacity of the capital ' s air services.
Following Shanghai, Beijing became the second city with two airports in the same city, serving mainly domestic air services as the Shanghai Rainbow Bridge International Airport, similar to the Pudong Airport, which is dominated by international shipping aviation, and the future capital airport and Da Hing Airport, which will also provide a more disaggregated service with different locations that serve different air operations at the national and international levels.
Da Hing Airport is more beneficial to the capital airport from a business development point of view.
The capital airport reached 100 million passengers in 2018 and was the country ' s highest in terms of passenger throughput, but there are still significant shortfalls in transport compared to the rapidly growing operational demand, especially for international routes.
To better serve the needs of domestic and international passengers, travel, etc., and to adapt to the increasing openness of Beijing and the trend towards internationally integrated urban development, Daesing International Airport has been positioned as a major international hub airport with plans to meet 100 million annual passenger throughputs and 4 million tons of mail through.
So, there's no overlap between the location of the two airports, and there's plenty of market space for different client groups.
At the economic level, it is clear that international navigation at Da Hing International Airport will have a win-win effect by easing tensions in Beijing, accelerating the rate of passenger and cargo throughput, and creating incremental cakes for the double-nuclear operation of Capital Air.
From a user ' s point of view, as the international airport is accessible, it is not necessary to concentrate all future trips on the capital airport, but it can also reduce the range of problems associated with the excessive concentration of routes, such as longer stop security times, slower passenger boarding, indirectly increasing the time spent at the airport by aircraft and passengers, increasing the burden of airport operations, reduced shipping through the capital airport, and, in fact, improved passenger travel experience.
According to media estimates of the time and cost of various transport routes to large international airports, e.g., travelling from the five southern rings to the high-speed airport in Kyoto, driving in 50 minutes will cost about $40 per hour and 15 per cent per hour for fuel, and choosing the rail-traffic metro airport line, which is limited to a distance of 20 kilometres and 30 kilometres, at a fare of $10, $25, $35; citizens can also travel from Beijing West Station to Da Hing Airport Station for more than 20 minutes.
In general, citizens have a wide range of transport options at Da Hing Airport, and the costs and time are more reasonable.
In terms of trends, Da Hing airport is located as a traffic hub in Kyoto and is therefore a little further away from Beijing, but has reinforced the radiation of Hebei, Tianjin and facilitated more people ' s movement, which is of great importance to the economic development of Tianjin.
In the future, Hebei, the Tianjin passengers will have access to more international air route services from Da Hing International Airport, as can be seen from the traffic planning at Da Hing Airport.
Da Hing Airport is well equipped with a number of highways connecting Da Hing Airport to the surrounding area, in addition to the new airport route from Beijing City to Da Hing Airport.
This is just like Guangdong Dongdong, Fushan, King Wan and other city passengers can go to Bai Yun Airport in Guangzhou on the Guangzhou Highway, and residents of Beijing, Yu An-Zin, etc. will benefit from Da Hing airport and access to easy and efficient air services.
As can be seen, access to the international airport of Da Hing is not limited to the addition of several runways and aircraft, whether at the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience or regional aviation integration, and the development of the integration dimension of Kyoto is far-reaching and positive, not only in terms of the long-term layout and development of the shipping industry in Beijing, but also in terms of the diversification of options for the movement of a large number of residents in Kyoto, and the further improvement of the quality of services in the shipping industry in Beijing, which is more conducive to the integrated development process in Kyoto and to the economic and trade developments around the airport.
So we're going to make a big deal not only for the individual, but also for the overall development of the airport.

2019 Viet Nam Forum on Economic and Social Issues held in Cebu Province
The Deputy Director General of the Economic Committee of the National Assembly of Viet Nam, Nguyen Dejeng, revealed that early this year, Viet Nam ' s economic and social development showed many new signs and continued growth.
The Forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the Forum, participants had an in-depth exchange of views and views on the economic developments of 2019 and the impact of some of the FTAs, the salient issues of the Vietnamese economy in 2019, the salient socio-cultural issues in Viet Nam in 2019 and the projections and proposals for Viet Nam ' s economic and social development in 2020.
There was general agreement that global economic growth slowed and risks and challenges increased in the first months of 2019.
Trade frictions among major economies have further reduced global trade and investment.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), despite the uncertainty of the global economy, in which 70 per cent of the world ' s economies have stagnated in growth, Viet Nam ' s economic development has been marked by many promising achievements, smooth macroeconomic performance, effective inflation control and an average consumer price index growth of 2.64 per cent in the first half of 2019, the lowest in nearly three years.
GDP grew by 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2019, although it was below 7.05 per cent in the same period last year, but the increase was still high compared to the same period in the period 2011-2017.
In forecasting trends in Viet Nam ' s economic development from 2019 to 2020, the Deputy Director-General of Viet Nam ' s National Centre for Economic and Social Projections stated that, against the backdrop of the turmoil in the world economy, Viet Nam ' s economy showed a high growth momentum in 2019.
By 2020, Viet Nam ' s macroeconomic performance is expected to remain generally stable, with the implementation of trade-related agreements contributing to trade development, economic restructuring and improved business environment further strengthened, and foreign export activity in Viet Nam is expected to decline as a result of trade frictions.
There is therefore a need to strengthen early warning mechanisms for monitoring forecasts, to proactively seek trade relief measures for Viet Nam ' s exports, to find opportunities to expand new export markets and to facilitate the export of various commodities, such as agricultural and water products.
At the same time, inflation is kept at reasonable levels, thereby contributing to the development of ancillary industries and supporting the development of high-tech, organic and ecological agriculture.
Liu Zhijie, Director of the Consular Office at Siem Reap, Embassy of China in Cambodia, hosted a reception in Siem Reap to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China.
Liu Jijie said that in the 70 years since the establishment of the new China, China has actively participated in international affairs and contributed more to China ' s intellectual and Chinese programmes to improve global economic governance and promote common global development, making an important contribution to world peace and development and bringing tangible benefits to Cambodia ' s economic development and the well-being of its people.
Liu Jijie explained that, as the world's second largest economy, China contributed more than 30 per cent to world economic growth, particularly in the context of China's "one-way" initiative, where cooperation between local provinces and cities and the provinces of Siem Reap and Siem Reap continued to deepen.
He said that this year marked the beginning of 61 years of Chinese-Cambodian relations, that the two countries had fraternal friendships and that mutually beneficial cooperation would be the driving force of local economic and social development.
The Governor of Siem Reap Province, Desaiha, highly commends the great achievements of the new China over the past 70 years and congratulates China and China on the results of their friendly cooperation.
Desaiha expects both sides to continue to work together to promote Chinese-Chinese friendship and cooperation, to strengthen mutual trust and benefit and to improve the standard of living of the people.
According to Disakha, Siem Reap Province has had remarkable relations with China ' s provinces and cities. To date, it has concluded friendly relations with China ' s 28 provinces and cities. The large-scale cultural and artistic projects "Ug Ko Smile" and "Ug Ko Dynasty" have landed, the Siem Reap-Kangxi Agricultural Demonstration Park, the Siem Reap New International Airport Project, special training courses for Siam provincial government officials, the Siem Retro Scholarship for Siem Retring, rural consultations, the renovation of urban roads, and the Cataract Rehabilitation and Public Interest Project "Light Walk" have yielded fruitful cooperation, and in the context of friendly cooperation, the Siem Reap people have become direct beneficiaries.
The reception was attended by the Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia, Ken Wensson, the President of the Siem Reap Provincial Council, the Governor of the five provinces in the region, the Siem Reap branch of the Cambodian Council, volunteer teachers, the Siem Reap branch of the Cambodian Chamber of Commerce, representatives of Chinese companies and foreign leaders in Siem Reap.
"The Ten Years of Digital China" - Xinhuanet.
If the 2009 local website forum were to be used as a starting point, the 2019 Clouds Conference in Hangzhou has been going on for 10 years.
From the concept of cloud fog, to the practice of cloud clouds, big data, cloud computing has been one of the core technologies underpinning China's economic development, social management, public services over 10 years.
At the Jin-taek Energy Lightvolt Battery Workshop in Heining, Zhejiang, the Quality Inspector has recently been accompanied by a new "worker" with the artificial intelligence of Ali.
It's open for 24 hours. It's more than twice as fast as a man, and the accuracy of the quality check is stable at more than 95%.
According to the head of the company, the Quality Inspector with the camera has concentrated on learning more than 40,000 defective samples, which, with the cloud computing power behind it, can quickly convert infrared images into binary languages, with defective battery fragments classified.
This enterprise is only a microcosm of the transformation of today's cloud computing support industries.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Informatics published the " Guide to Promoting Corporate Clouds Implementation (2018-2020) " , which proposes that by 2020, there will be a significant increase in corporate cloud awareness and motivation, as well as a significant increase in cloud ratios and depth of application.
King Ken, founder of Ariyun, said that today, data-centred cloud computing has opened the way for data to bridge the digital economy as a key element.
At the same time, our cloud computing industry has grown in size over the past 10 years.
The " White Paper on cloud computing development (2019) " issued by the Chinese Institute of Information and Communications last July shows that the size of the overall market for cloud computing in China reached 96.28 billion yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.2 per cent over 2017.
In addition to being the key technology to support industrial transformation, the invisible cloud has transformed urban governance and social life.
This year's cloud convention, the city's brain for three years in a row is still a concern.
Ali Yun described the fact that the urban brain has now been transformed from a traffic governance tool into an urban governance hub, and that the collaborative application has been extended to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the urban brain, through its strong computing power, has enabled new urban management services such as the "Car first and pay first" and "Tourist route design" to be realized.
In the area of government services, one thing with a cloud, one with a desk, one with a desk, one with a desk, and the cloud is calculated to facilitate the supply of government services on both sides.
Zhejiang has now established a unified public data platform throughout the province through the political cloud.
As of 11 September, the platform had covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million corporate units in the province, bringing together 3066 million categories of 19.8 billion data.
The average monthly number of calls by the Zhejiang provincial government departments has reached 12 million, and every time the data moves on a cloud, it may mean that the crowd is less motivated.
Makoto makes tea with a plastic tea bag!
According to the Central News Agency, a recent study in Canada recently found that a bag of plastic tea bags could release billions of plastic particles, significantly higher than an estimated total intake of microplastics per person, but there is no evidence to date that the ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
Researchers at McGill University in Canada have reportedly found that leaching plastic tea bags into a glass of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius) will release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles into the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than the total estimated amount of microplastics taken by a person.
According to research published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles a year, while inhaling the same amount of microplastics.
According to information, the study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, where researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea packs at Monterey Shop and Cafe, opened the tea bag, washed the tea bag into almost boiling water for five minutes and analysed it using electronic microscopes and spectrometers.
According to this study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, " several steps above the plastic load of other foods " .
According to reports, most tea bags are made of natural fibres, but many brands with natural fibres still use plastic to seal them.
Some brand tea bags are no longer paper-based, but instead plastics, which are the subject of tests by researchers.
Plastic particles are microscopic fragments of plastics, which researchers define as being in the range of 100 nm to 5 m3 and which are mainly produced by disassembly of plastic waste.
Researchers found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and deep-sea trenches around the world, running water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
Researchers first found plastic particles in human excreta samples from several countries in different regions of the world in October 2018.
In order to test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released from the tea pack, the Canadian research team placed daphnia in contaminated water and found that microplastics affected the behaviour of the daphnia and caused them to develop abnormalities.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), to date there is no evidence that the ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
WHO notes, however, that more research is needed to understand fully how these plastics spread into the environment and how they affect humans.
Researchers assume that the large amount of plastic particles released from these tea bags may be due to the exposure of these plastic bags to boiling water, and may decomposition or seepage of toxic substances even when "food grade" plastics are heated up to 40 degrees Celsius.
Guterres said that climate emergencies were the greatest threat to the survival of small island States.
There, a natural disaster erodes a generation of human development gains.
This is illustrated by the hurricanes that have struck Babuda since this year, by the disasters in Dominica and the Bahamas.
About a quarter of the people in small island developing States live at an altitude of 5 metres or less.
The eviction may seriously affect their society and way of life and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At this Monday ' s Climate Action Summit, small island States are committed to achieving carbon neutrality and 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030, thus again leading the world in the right direction.
Gutierrez said: " The climate crisis is accumulating new injustices over old injustices ...
Although small island developing States contribute little to global warming, they pay the highest price.
Because of their middle-income status, many countries are caught in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disaster and debt ...
The world must act. It is time to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States ... "
Today ' s high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for the search for ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risks, invest in climate-adapted infrastructure and transform renewable energy; and urging international institutions to help small island developing States, particularly highly indebted middle-income countries, to access funding.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the Earth's lifeline — the ocean.
The latest special report issued this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans have suffered the severe consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of the century, many regions may be experiencing extreme sea-level rises that would have occurred only once a century ago.
The report warns that some island countries may become uninhabitable without significant investment in adaptation.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused huge losses.
In the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while in the last 40 years plastic pollution has increased tenfold.
Industry, shipping, mining and tourism demand are leading to reduced resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities.
Small island States also face high costs of transportation, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on external markets, subjecting them to price fluctuations.
Some States are also working to address the security implications of illicit trafficking in persons, arms and drugs ...
Gutierrez said: " By addressing an issue in the most challenging environment, it can be solved anywhere ...
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the "Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030" will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples that can be used worldwide ... "
He stressed that small island developing States were a special case for sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the international community as a whole.
The Ministry of Finance of India has indicated that the financial system is sufficiently mobile.
India ' s finance minister, Sitalaman 26, stated that the current financial system is sufficiently liquid and that the economic growth of India is expected to recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by the need for the festival ' s consumption.
Seetalaman made this statement after a meeting with representatives of private Indian banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks, etc.
Seetalaman didn't say what those words were about.
Some of the former Indian and overseas media have attributed the sustained slowdown in the Indian economy to the liquidity constraints of non-bank financial institutions.
The fall in car sales, for example, denied that liquidity constraints were the main cause of the decline in sales.
Seetalaman points out that the fall in car sales is mainly due to cyclical factors.
Seetalaman predicts that India's economy may recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday consumption.
India's annual shopping season began in September and will continue until the end of the year.
The market anticipates that shopping consumption will contribute significantly to economic growth in India.
The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education has recently issued a circular prohibiting schools throughout the province from failing to attend classes during the National Day Leave, and organizing random unannounced visits by personnel.
In the circular issued on the prohibition of compensatory training for the head of state holiday, the Jiangxi Provincial Education Office stressed that during the National Day, schools in all parts of the country must be firmly committed to the following: no student shall be allowed to organize group remedial or new classes, no training courses in subjects, no class of specialization, no class of study, no class of study, no class of study, no class of interest, no class of promotion, no school premises shall be rented to other educational institutions for various courses.
At the same time, in-service primary and secondary school teachers are prohibited from organizing, advising and inducing students to attend in- and out-of-school remedial classes, in-service primary and secondary school teachers to attend out-of-school training institutions or by other teachers, parents, parents ' committees, etc., and in-service primary and secondary school teachers are prohibited from introducing students to extra-school training institutions and others and providing relevant information.
The circular makes it clear that, in the case of confirmed violations of remedial education in primary and secondary schools, the local education administration will increase the deductions in the quality development education appraisals of the district governments in that year; teachers involved in the remedial courses will be dealt with in a serious manner in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Teacher-Technology Division.
Support for pig production, guarantee market supply.
Benevolence requires that measures be implemented in six ways.
A provincial teleconferencing meeting on the market for guaranteed pig production was held today to mobilize the redeployment of the central and provincial government ' s policy measures to support the production of pig production to secure market supply.
Be faithful and take six steps to produce a pig.
The mayor of the "basket" is responsible for making sure that this year ' s clear 45 million first-born pigs have been sent to the municipalities to be included in the accountability test.
Take policy measures and implement the last kilometre.
Take care of the production of pig pigs, implement carefully the policy of good seeding subsidies, encourage pig growing enterprises to expand the scale of pig breeding, and systematically select excellent piglets from the group of commodity pigs.
I'm going to take the lead in attracting money and make it a top priority to attract money to the country's large-scale farming enterprises, which are not yet in our province.
Keep the market flow system in place, speed up the construction of cold chain logistics facilities for pigs and promote a shift from pig to meat.
Take care of the modern system of prevention and control, provide basic quarantine personnel appropriate to the scale of the farm and the tasks of the work, and establish the first line of protection against disease.
Be faithful and do everything in its power to secure the supply of meat markets, ensure that there are no large shortages and large-scale cuts in supply, and ensure that the supply of pork markets for major holidays is stable.
The Conference also deployed efforts to sustain the control of the African swine fever epidemic, to ban re-arrests in key waters of the Governor's river basin, and to acquire rice for the entire province at mid-to-night.
For the love of the motherland, the spirit of the nation, and the old Shanghai word for the rabbits.
"Me and my motherland" has made college students happy.
On the occasion of the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China, Shanghai made soaps, Quanjiang, the Big White Rabbit, four famous Shanghai Old Words gathered on 27th of the Chinese University of Technology for " Art " , four Shanghai Old Letters representing an average of more than 90 years of history, and Qiqi told more than 200 young scholars about the country of the old word, the spirit of the nation.
The display of the old brand's product on the scene.
It's amazing for the students to hear what's going on in the classroom, to find out about the display of old brands outside the classroom, and the "Me and My Motherland" campus, to make college students happy.
Big Rabbit Lippaste, Big Rabbit Ice cream... as an old brand, Big Rabbit's milk sugar has been aggressive in recent years, aggressive, persistently innovative and cross-border.
The Big Rabbit, born in 1959, happens to be 60th birthday this year.
Xiao Wan is also looking at the youth consumer group.
Weiji Wang, Deputy Managing Director of the Party branch of Shanghai Skins and Food Company Ltd., referred to the scene of "Spring-eating abalone, summer hot, bad fish, autumn-drinking shrimp, winter-drinked crabs" as a reflection of people's continuous innovation in eating.
Companies have also developed brand culture in terms of taste innovation, caricature packaging, etc., to adapt to the heritage of younger consumer groups.
The old word represents the way of innovation on the art class.
Yuji, the manager of the Bleeding Rice and Catering Company Ltd. in Shanghai, agreed that " all innovations are based on solid foundations, and each of the old ones is a thin-haired process. "
Everyone's looking forward to the old word.
At the heart of the product, the age of small and beautiful should begin ... "
As one of the country's first "old Chinese" characters, Shanghai's fresh food was quickly adapted to market trends, the brands were upgraded visually, professional teams were introduced and the turnover was significantly increased.
"The old word is not only seen in traditional channels such as supermarkets, but now the old word is also actively involved in new retailing and activities.
All our changes, in the end, will have to achieve the goal that consumers can see, hear and, in the end, buy ... "
Uyang Ling, Deputy General Manager of Shanghai Soap Co. Ltd., says...
In the future, Shanghai soap production will also continue to develop at the high end, with a broad vision of system development, energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products satisfactory to users, and a high-tech and cost-effective path.
Through the art party class, students have gained a lot.
I grew up with the old word, with the good memories and emotions of my childhood. "
I'm so glad you're here.
The Shanghai old word represents more than 200 young scholars who speak about the old brand of the country, the spirit of the nation.
Joo Xing said that how to tap into brand culture so that quality traditional culture can be inherited from generation to generation is a question that we, as designer students, need to think about and explore.
The Party class is based on the "Shanghai Image" project of Ting Wei, Dean of the University of Technology and Arts, Professor Nisheng's "Old Words Integrating Brand Innovation Room" and hopes to deepen the cultural potential and modern commercial values of the old word, to build on the competitiveness and influence of the Shanghai word, to strengthen the cultural radioactivity of the Shanghai word, to achieve the industrial effect of "1+1>2" in the form of "Design + Culture" and to present Shanghai culture from a new perspective.
According to the information received, the Arts Party class will also continue to invite all humans of history, masters of drawings, masters of pottery, master of non-destiny, master of architecture, master of landscapes to serve as lecturers, through which they tell stories of innovation and adherence to Chinese culture, highlight the characteristics of the times, further entrench the ideals of university students, promote the love of the students, speak with their works, make their works sound, and invent the form of party classes, to teach subjects that students love, to enhance the ideological, theoretical and affinity of the parties, to target, to increase the infectiveness of the party classes and to nurture the newcomer of the era who can serve as a national renaissance!
Abe took a video to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China and said a word in Chinese.
On the 26th local time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe congratulated the People's Republic of China on its 70th anniversary via video.
Prime Minister Abe: Good evening, I'm Abe.
On the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to the Government and people of Japan.
At the G20 Osaka Summit in June, China and China declared to the world the firm will of the G20 through the " Declaration of the G20 Leaders Osaka Summit " to make the summit a success.
In addition, at the inter-Japanese summit and dinner, prior to the summit, it was agreed that President Xi Jinping would visit Japan in the spring of next year, while agreeing to usher in a new era in Japan.
Japan and China share a great responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and the world.
It is my firm belief that a new model of future relations between the two countries, working together to address the problems facing the region and the world and contributing to the international community, will be beneficial.
In conclusion, I wish you a prosperous relationship and a prosperous career for your friends.
"It is estimated that more than half of the over-age farmers work on some sites.
Where do we find young workers now?
There's no way to use so many old people on the site. "
In recent days, Zou Kui, a long-time contractor working in the construction industry, lamented the existence of a large number of over-age farmers (over retirement age) on the site.
In recent times, I've been working on a storm partition at the high school where I'm based, and there's a lot of farmers on campus, and if you watch, you'll find a lot of over-age farmers in it.
Farmer workers who are over-age work outside the country are not "free " , but because they can't, because they have "must" — whether they save money to solve their old age and medical problems or help their children — drive these old people who were supposed to be "free" to continue their hard work.
The "good old man" of the over-age farmer, not as easy as we thought.
Raising children, raising old people, helping children to study, helping them build buildings to buy cars, helping their children to start a family, raising grandchildren from generation to generation, and when these farm workers do their "life mission " , the bags have been emptied and even have many debts, mostly lacking in wealth.
In order not to delay children and to save some wealth for themselves, many farmers insist on "doing until they can't do it."
Many post-80 "after "90" or "after "00" new generations of farmers are reluctant to engage in difficult, labour-intensive secondary industries or low-end services, creating structural "workless " jobs that are unattractive and provide opportunities for over-age farmers.
Due to a lack of skills and reduced physical and labour capacities, many over-age farmers are engaged in intensive, low-paying, high-risk and low-security jobs.
One day's work, one day's work, a little more, and the plight of the over-age farmers behind the "no time" can't be ignored and ignored.
Addressing the problem of unpaid and unpaid wages, improving labour protection, reducing safety risks, increasing labour income and improving the survival of over-age farmers, besides their " self-repair " , is equally dependent on public sector institutional and human care.
It has been pointed out by scholars that over-age farmers are less likely to rely on home-grown farming to solve their old-age and medical problems, and that they have to support their families by other means.
The incompetence and strength of reading the "no freeness" of the over-age farmers helps us better understand the love and pain of the over-age farmers.
Seeing the back of the over-age farmers, hearing their groans, trying to get them back to the countryside to really make their way back into old age, requiring the public sector, the market and society to share their responsibilities in virtuous interactions, and multiple synergies.
Chemetzov said that Russia would not export the system for the next five years, because "it is first to supply its own military forces before export production takes place " .
This practice is fully consistent with international practice.
The major producers of weapons and military equipment always ensure their defence needs first and then deal with export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Gryhoff, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Sky Force, said that the development of the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system was developed by the "Goldum-Ante" Sky Defense Concean.
This is the new generation of anti-aircraft systems using the working principles used to destroy ballistics and aerodynamics.
The main role of S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, which are capable of intercepting missiles with a range of less than 3,500 kilometres.
In addition, according to certain sources, S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles as well as aircraft, almost all types of drones, five times faster than sound speed, or even near space targets.
Such weapons can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defence systems, particularly S-400, which is very important from a defence perspective.
Sergei Chemetzov expressed particular concern about S-400.
He said that the system was in great demand in the world, but the Russian army needed it, including in the Arctic.
S-400 air defence systems into the Arctic air defence regiment.
According to the 15 September news, the conversion of S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems by the New Earth Islands Arctic Air Defence Regiment has been completed.
This is not Russia's militarization of the Arctic.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, this is entirely a process within the transition to a more advanced defence tool in the strategic direction of the north.
According to the North Russian Fleet Information Service: " With the transition to the new S-400 air defence system, there has been a marked increase in the controlable airspace of the Arctic ... "
Most importantly, according to military assessments, the system has been successfully used in the far north and the Arctic.
The air defences trained the new system and prepared for combat duty.
It was equipped with S-300 long-range air defence systems, and it's still part of it.
With regard to air defence systems, they must possess weapons capable of destroying a wide range of air objects, be they high-speed targets in the outer altitude, or "fish leaking out of the net" near protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by Gold Diamonds-Antaire Air Defense Concerne, was designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other aerial assault weapons.
This weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within a range of 400 km and shoot down ballistic targets at a distance of 60 km at 4.8 km per second.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defence forces in the far north to ensure the safety of air space on the northern sea.
Not long ago, the first 12 "Tor"-M2DT" anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, enough to form an air defence battalion to strengthen the anti-aircraft systems in the Arctic.
The Russian Ministry of Defence said at that time that the Arctic "Tor" unit would be extended to full brigade formation in the future.
Add the new S-400 remote system deployed on Newts and the Kola peninsula and the Pantsir-SA short-range system deployed in the far north, which is a powerful shield for Russia's polar sky.
Enemy planes, helicopters and drone missiles will be hard to break through.
According to the Russian government, the flagship shop will serve as a platform for Russian manufacturers to place their goods, avoiding the complicated and lengthy process of opening their own.
Russian multinationals, which are the operators of Russian stores, focus on selling Russian goods in China.
The largest trading platforms in China, such as Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduo, Hand Q (ShouQ), Multi-Purpose Immediate Software Wechat, have online shops and have their own online platforms Epinduo.com and Russian retail chains.
The Russian Export Center will work with Russians to develop marketing strategies and participation standards for shops and screen virtual shelf-loading companies.
The store is scheduled to open by the end of this year and build up at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
According to Russian export centre data, the total number of visits to China ' s power merchant platforms is as high as 1 billion per month.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014, reaching over $1 billion in 2018.
Currently, the Alibaba Group will also open pilot shops for the sale of commodities from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of the Global Import Strategy.
According to Alexei Kozhevnikov, the new store will display the goods of enterprises with sales of at least 500 million roubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, 500 million rubles are not enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers are quite positive about Russian commodities, and regard our commodities as high-quality and green-friendly ... "
Kozhevnikov said that competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power was intense and increasing.
He said: " Our goal is ambitious and 500 businesses are launched through this store within three years... "
At the same time, the platform will build the products of Russian Far East enterprises.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, Professor of the Fundamentals of Trade Policy at the Russian Plykhanov Economic University, said: " It is a political project that represents the image of both sides, since the Russian export centre is a State-owned, not a private, institution ... "
"I don't see a lot of highly competitive Russian goods on the market... "
He thought that the project might not really be implemented, but it would help to strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to the Russian news agency, Andrei Slepnev, President of the Russian Export Centre, stated during the Eastern Economic Forum that more than 170 Russian enterprises ' product information had been posted on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesaler platform, and could be purchased in China or elsewhere.
In addition, there is a model for cooperation with the Alibaba Group, a training project for Russian enterprises by experts from the University of Bao Po, whose first seminar was held in July this year.
The Russian Export Center will also be the organizer of Russian enterprises participating in industry exhibitions and business projects at the Second China International Import Fair in Shanghai in November this year.
A major exhibition will be held in the 1,000-metre exhibition hall, where commercial project activities, signing ceremonies, presentations and meetings with Chinese business representatives will also be held.
So far, about 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The Information Service of the Russian Export Centre said: " In addition to the agricultural exhibition stand, we will also have business meetings, i.e. direct contacts between entrepreneurs ... " .
" This is another direction of our efforts aimed at supporting businesses and ensuring that dozens of specialized meetings are scheduled for them ... "
In addition, the fair will hold master classes, cooking competitions and Russian-renowned cuisine-cooking meetings on the project "Exploring Russian Food Stations on the Sea".

When's the next bus coming?
The Internet+intellectuals make your mind count.
On 27th, the Nanjing Smart Traffic Union Gold Map announced that the country's first Internet+Intelligent Stations would be officially landed in Nanjing, where 54 public transport electronics will be lighted, which will completely upgrade Nanjing's information services, improve public transport efficiency and the well-being of its citizens.
In the past, waiting for an anxiety scene at the bus stop almost every day.
It is difficult to predict the duration of the bus, the condition of the bus along the road and the location of the vehicle, and the issue of the public hand-over is a matter of urgency, especially in some major cities, where long commutes and complex traffic conditions at morning and night commute peaks have been difficult to secure.
To this end, Nanjing Smart Traffic, together with the Gold Map, explored the new directions of Internet+Travel Human Services and launched the country's first Intelligent Service project, Internet+Intelligent Stations.
According to the information received, the country's first Internet+intelligent stations landed in Nanjing, combining the Grand Gold data with the expected time frame ETA algorithm for Goth's vehicles and relying on bus electronics and mobile Internet, major traffic data upgrades, the ability to distribute bus routes at both ends of the bus smart stations plus electronic maps, and the expected time for the bus to reach the station.
By means of the Internet+intelligent station, Nanjing citizens not only have easy access to the expected arrival time of the bus, the real-time location of the bus and the number of stops at the current station, but also have a three-colour visual view of the road through the oranges, making it possible to see the real-time status of all bus lines through the station.
Thanks to the warm-up technology of the Internet+smart station, Nanjing citizens have achieved the easy and efficient form of public hand-over when the bus gets to the station and when the bus gets to the destination.
On the basis of real-time bus information from the Internet+smart station, select the most appropriate route for your travel, while at the same time providing for psychological expectations and reducing the anxiety of the waiting car, making travel more convenient.

Xinhua Times Review: Stand firm and follow our own path.
The White Paper "China and the World of the New Age", published on 27th, answers: China's development has been successful for 70 years because, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the right path to development, and are firmly committed to that path.
China follows its own path of development. It's the choice of history, the choice of the people.
In recent times, in an environment of weakness and internal distress, generations of human beings have sought and sought refuge on the path to save their country.
However, " the constitutional monarchy, the reintroduction of imperialism, the parliamentary system, the multiparty system, the presidential system have thought about it, tried it, and it didn ' t work out... "
It was only with the Communist Party of China and the new China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a path of socialism of Chinese character in practice.
China ' s path is one of happiness for the Chinese people, the revival of the Chinese nation and the common development of China and the rest of the world.
It is on the right path that China will be able to do its job properly, to become the world ' s second largest economy and to contribute most to global economic growth, and to continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As noted in the White Paper, this path of development in China is consistent with China ' s circumstances and adapted to the demands of the times and will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward.
In retrospect, the Chinese people know how hard it is to find the right path; to look around the world, the Chinese people value it even more.
The Chinese know the logic of South Orange, they understand that what suits others is not always good for themselves, but best for themselves.
It is with this road of confidence and strategic certainty that China has created a world-renowned miracle.
In the course of the twists and turns of the human race, the final conclusion of history was famous for a while.
Today, the success of China's special socialist path ended with the collapse of the final conclusion of history, the collapse of the Chinese collapse doctrine, the failure of the socialist failure theory.
China ' s success has boosted the confidence of developing countries to become rich and powerful. It has expanded the way for developing countries to modernize. It has provided experience and lessons for countries and peoples in the world that both wish to accelerate their development and maintain their independence on a path that is appropriate to their national circumstances.
The world is rich and diverse.
China has always respected the right of every country to choose its own path to development.
China will not "enter" the foreign model, nor "export" the Chinese model, but will firmly pursue its own path, achieve its own continuous development, strengthen exchanges with countries on governance and governance, and make its due contribution to the common good of good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that a 66-year-old female worker was fired by text from the owner of the Foodworks supermarket because he preferred to hire an employee from an Asian background, whose practices were strongly criticized as " disgraceful " .
The Commission stated that Ms. Gail Ayton ' s boss, Jianbin Wang, English name Eddie, who worked at Wagga store for more than 20 years, treated her employees in an " unfair manner " and could violate the anti-discrimination law.
Ms. Ayton told the Committee that Mr. Wang had taken over the store in 2016 and that he had always "wanted to fire me" because she was not Chinese.
In this case, the Vice-Chairman of the Commission, Peter Sams, conducted a search on the Internet and found that "Mr. Wang used to publish a number of job advertisements in various Australian employment forums " .
Among the job requirements listed for these positions, one said "Favorite Asian" and the other said "Favorite Asian staff".
The third post says, "He's more inclined to be overseas."
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton by text message in April this year, later claiming that this was due to her absence from work and the alleged small cash deficit of $5.10 to $30 on the cash register.
But Mr. Sams said that Mr. Wang's reasons for dismissing Ms. Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.
She's been absent for only one shift in three years, and the missing amount is a few Australian dollars.
He said that Ms. Ayton's dismissal had nothing to do with her conduct or performance.
He said: " It seems to me that, supported by the evidence of Mr. Wang ' s advertisement, the real motive for the dismissal is that he prefers to hire employees with Asian backgrounds ...
According to section 772(f) of Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang ' s actions appear to constitute an unlawful violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or dismissal of the applicant ... "
Mr. Sams said it would be inappropriate for Mr. Wang to consider reinstating Ms. Ayton's position, given his appalling treatment.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms. Ayton, a casual worker with an hourly salary of $26.
In view of possible violations of anti-discrimination and industrial relations legislation, Sams indicated that he would submit his decisions and documents to the Commission for consideration as to whether Mr. Wang ' s actions should be transferred to other bodies to investigate possible violations of state or federal laws.
He said that Mr. Wang had not given Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.
He said: " I think that the defendant should have taken an unfair and biased process of irresistible dismissal of the applicant, Mr. Wang "waiting" the opportunity, which he thought would `prove' the termination of the applicant's employment. "
"He was wrong... and it should be argued that in dismissing the applicant, the person completely ignored any natural justice given to her. It was shocking that he was impolite and grossly unjust ... "
Mr. Sams said that while Foodworks is a small business " it must be said frankly that no decent employer would dismiss an employee in the most unfair and perfunctory manner recognized in this case ... "
He said: " This is shameful and extremely unfair ... "
We've got a lot of passengers on the train, 175 traffics, and we've got a new network.

The Guangti Group will undertake a number of initiatives to provide passenger services during peak passenger flows.
The three-storey security corridor was optimized at Guangzhou South Station, with 12 additional security channels added, with a total of 44 security corridors in the three-storey waiting room. In addition, 19 self-service real-name certification devices were added at Guangzhou South Station to facilitate access to the passenger flow line, for a total of 71.
In order to ease the presence and congestion of vehicles on the south-south road at the south station, three new parking lots will be opened at the south station in Guangzhou, with 1,000 additional parking spaces to ease the pressure on the south side of the station.
Shenzhen North Station will open a free-of-censorship green channel.
On 6-7 October, during the peak period, the Shenzhen North Station A2 exit site will be connected to the subway with a free-of-censorship route to facilitate travel by passengers arriving at the peak hour.
In addition, East and West Square will provide regular U-colored fast passages for passengers who arrive at the station 15 minutes before driving and for special priority passengers.
On the eve of the Golden Week of the National Day, a full-time operational training programme was conducted in the nine passenger sections to ensure that the full-time personnel involved in the performance of the functions were trained in operational knowledge, to improve the quality of service, and to ensure that the train attendants were given a good mental profile and a more professional standard of operating quality and were able to perform every trip to provide a better quality of service to the passengers.
Six people denied being involved in the pseudo-macca paper case before the High Court.
Six men suspected of counterfeiting and selling our passports, filing paper and identification cards, including an assistant director of the National Registry, and a businessman with the rank of supervisor, who passed the case on Thursday, the district court judge approved the charges against trafficking in persons and anti-trafficking in migrants and transferred them to the High Court for trial.
Among them, the defence lawyer who originally represented the Chinese defendant, Le Zhenhua, and Member of Parliament Ryer of the Sunset Hole District, applied to the judge to withdraw from representing the case and no longer became the defendant ' s representative counsel and was granted permission in court.
He states that he himself drew criticism from his political opponents for representing the accused and that his party of action was also implicated.
He stressed that he was not afraid of any threats in his own right, but that he did not want to be used by irresponsible units to discredit the Action Party and the Greek Government or other Greek leaders, and that the decision was taken after careful consideration.
He also said that there was no conflict of interest between representing the accused and being a member of Parliament, that he was not legally prohibited from representing any of the accused and that, to date, the defendant, Le Zhenhua, had not been convicted.
Six defendants were charged in court on 12 September this year and denied their guilt and were not granted bail by the court against many charges under article 26E of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Trafficking in Migrants Act and article 466 of the Penal Code (forgery of documents).
On Thursday, Judge Nozaha and Mazlan granted the prosecution ' s application, following the arguments of both parties, to refer to the High Court the charges against the six defendants for the anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking immigration ordinances; the charges of forgery of documents will be heard on 3 October, pending the prosecution ' s surrender of the documents to the defence.
The first six defendants were arrested under the National Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (SOSMA) and therefore the judge did not grant bail.
Walking with the motherland — a squad of the Armed Police Forces.
Kim Qiu, at the military training field, an army unit of an average strength of 1.83 metres was busy training.
Shining thorns, unique olive greens and red shoulders together form a bright landscape.
The day before the reporter walked into the party and felt the determination of the soldiers to remain loyal to the Party and the people and their "honour" love and pursuit.
"Dreaming a glorious life, writing about the immortal legend of the new era... " This is a team song written by a team of soldiers and soldiers — " Walking with the Motherland " .
In the team, this song is the motto of every member of the team.
The height of 1.92 metres of Qi Xiaolight, standing outside the line.
He has a deeper understanding of honor as the champion of the former Carabinieri.
The honor of the soldiers comes from hard training.
Qui Xiaoqiao, a flagman, has always been a high standard of training.
He's tied to a sandbag, stuck in a second watch, strided with his eyes covered, stable with a wind.
There's a picture of him in his "Hand of the Flag" that never forgets.
One flag-raising ceremony, rain poured down, and none of the tourists who came to watch the flag-raising ceremony left.
The moment the flag rises, Qi Xiaoqiao feels deeply the glory represented by the red flag of the five stars on his shoulder.
In 2019, Qui Xiaoqiao was selected as the base soldier.
The base man and the flag man are different.
Xi Xiaoqiang explained that the march of the flag and the base force was often less than 20 steps ahead, but more effort was needed in training.
The base is number one in the first row, which directly determines the level of alignment.
After the parade started his training, he kicked his legs again and again every day.
In the demonstration, he was able to take a precise step, the speed of which was the hand of the soldiers.
Almost every member of the team has the same experience as Qi Xiaoqiao.
The soldier's father, Jojo East, was a participant 20 years ago in the 50th anniversary parade.
In order to follow his father's footsteps as a member of the team, he was frustrated once and again, but never discouraged.
He said, " I'd be proud to walk through Tiananmen Square like my father, to be seen by the party and the people, and I'd be willing to suffer anything in my life... "
Go into the Royal Honor Room, and the eight great words of the capital's Master Viagra are in the curtains.
The Queen of the Political Committee introduced the fact that all the members of the team came from the Beijing Brigade of the Carabinieri — a force with a tradition of honour, with major tasks such as the opening ceremony, the national celebrations, the security of successive party national congresses and the maintenance of counter-terrorism in the capital — and the creation of a large group of elites and individuals, such as the Flag Guards and the Guards' Hero Squadrons, with more than 50 units and individuals awarded honours by the State Council, the Central Military Commission and the Carabineros.

The TV show "Fox Hunting" is on the ground.
The "Fox Hunting" series of transnational crime scenes recently took place at Tianjin Airport, where actors such as Wang Kai and Wang Guo took pictures of important scenes such as escorting people suspected of having fled the economy back to the country, which were supported by China Southern Airlines.
This time at the airport, Foxhunting filmed the most important scene of the law enforcement results of Operation Fox — the capture of fugitives by Fox Hunters, the taking of planes, the signing of arrest warrants, etc.
The group took a look at the apron, customs border controls, cabins, hatches, etc., and recreated China's first-line multinational flights of detectives and fox-hunting heroes to capture the hard and professional journeys of fugitives.
In order to successfully complete the film, the Foxhunting team undertook a lot of preparatory work to confirm every detail of implementation and to ensure the most real and direct visual effect.
It's known that the play will be filmed in many places abroad.
Viet Nam needs to seize opportunities for artificial intelligence development.
The four criteria used to assess and rank the level of preparedness of cities in the face of the AI wave include prospects, capacity, asset base and direction.
Singapore is ranked first, followed by cities such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
Oliver Wyman, an expert from the organization, replied to a press interview for Mosin Pevana: " I find it very interesting to review and assess cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Viet Nam ...
In general, I think the future of Viet Nam is bright in the context of high growth rates, strong economic development paths and a rapidly growing talent base.
I think Viet Nam is on the right track and doing well.
It is important that Viet Nam know how to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the fourth industrial revolution to promote more economic development ... "
Artificial intelligence is completely changing people's work, communication and lifestyle.
It brings with it greater efficiency, but it also poses a threat of increasing social, economic and technological inequality.
However, according to a global study organized by Oliver Wyman, there are only cities in the world that are ready for the breakthrough of the age of artificial intelligence.

Wang Yi met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malawi, Kassala
On 26 local time, the Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malawi, Kasela, during his presence in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
In the 12 years since the establishment of the Sino-Ma border, the relationship between the two countries has developed in good health and stability, and exchanges and cooperation in various fields have progressed steadily.
Last year, President Xi Jinping invited President Mutharika to the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, where the two heads of State had fruitful meetings leading to a new step in the relationship between the two countries.
China is ready, together with Malaysia, to continue to implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of State and the outcome of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and to promote the further development of practical cooperation between the two countries.
China is ready to intensify its communication and cooperation with Malaysia in international affairs in order to safeguard the common interests of both sides and the wider context of Central Africa ' s relations.

About 800 million people traveled to China on the occasion of the Fourth National Day, reflecting on the demand for and supply of tourism in China.
About 800 million trips to the upcoming 11th Golden Week!
Large numbers of tourism platforms show that the country ' s tourism consumer markets are both booming in demand and supply.
The Jing Jing Tourism Report predicts that the number of domestic tourists is expected to be close to 800 million this year, in the light of previous national holiday tourism statistics; there will be more than 7.5 million more trips out of the country.
At present, tourists from more than 500 cities have booked tours through the platform, travel freely, customized tourism, local play, etc., covering 100 countries and territories.
According to the Chinese Institute of Tourism, 726 million domestic tourists were received on the national holiday last year, an increase of 9.43 per cent over the previous year.
This year ' s national holiday will not only be renewed in terms of the number of tourists, but will also be the main theme of the national holiday.
It is reported that the cost of inter-provincial tourism in the country during the national holiday was over $3,000 per person, up from the same period last year, owing to the fact that tourists generally chose to experience better products such as high-rated brand hotels, no-shopping tour groups, elite groups, car specials, etc.
There's a similar trend in the map of the donkey's mother's travel network, where a comfortable car model is used throughout the long line of the country, and a "privilion group" of less than 10 people is more popular than in previous years.
The spring and autumn tourist data show that its consumers are more interested in experience, service, and differentially "slow down " .
Flying pig data show that the fastest increase in tourist reservations in the country ' s four-line and sub-urban areas was 30 per cent on the same scale, reflecting an increase in consumption in more parts of the country.
Personalization is a major feature of this year's 11th Golden Week.
Portrait data show that the number of car rental orders for the National Day holiday is expected to increase by nearly 60 per cent on the same basis, while the short-distance travel of small crowds in the surrounding area continues to be popular; the number of private sector registrations increased by up to 155 per cent on the same basis.
Sharing joy becomes the main purpose of people's travel and leisure.
Data from travelling shows that 28 per cent of visitors on national holidays are family members, 25 per cent are couples, and 23 per cent are colleagues and friends.
Also, in terms of the age of tourists, "after 80" and "after 90" account for more than 50% of the total number of tourists.
It is a matter of concern that, unlike in the past, the growth of the gold round trip has been more rapid, and this year the domestic market has become more " sharper " .
Flying pig data show a 42% increase in the number of people booking the country's literary tour this year's national holiday, exceeding the speed of the trip.
Industry analysis, while demand is strong, promotes tourism supply side reforms across the country to provide tourists with a richer "Handover".
For example, the National Directorate of Sports, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, has recently issued a joint launch of the " Explicit Sports Touring Line for the 11th Golden Week of 2019 " ; 7 panels of 100 cultural and tourism events are being launched in 2019 in Shanghai to attract both Chinese and foreign tourists; and several provinces such as Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shandong and other provinces are approaching the Golden Week with price reductions or free measures.
The data from the booking show that the country ' s unique natural or cultural destinations are the " fire " , Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xian, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin will be the most popular tourist destination in the country.
Our first live film, "At this moment — celebrating the 70th birthday of New China" — will be broadcast simultaneously on October 1 in 70 cinemas in more than 10 provinces of the country.
Central Radio and Television will broadcast the 70th anniversary celebrations, parades and mass marches of New China on a big screen via a 4K super-high signal.
The head of the central radio and television station introduced in Kyoto 27 that on National Day, the station would build more than 100 seats and set up more than 200 sound pick-up devices along Chang An Street and high spots in the celebrations area, making use of video language and simultaneous sound for the first time to complete the process, with elements 4K super-high and 5.1 rounded live.
China is expected to become Australia's largest beef export market.
An animal protein analyst from the Dutch Cooperative Bank (Rabobank) said that China faced a severe shortage of pork following the outbreak of the African pigpest and was expected to become Australia ' s largest beef export market.
Since the outbreak, Chinese consumers are shifting from eating pork to other animal proteins, which has led to the destruction of many herds by the authorities. Over the past year, the number of piglets in China has been reduced by half, and the price of pork has almost doubled.
China produces and consumes two thirds of the world's pork.
According to Chenjun Pan, Senior Animal Protein Analyst, China District, Dutch Cooperative Bank, demand for other meat, including beef, has increased, with China, the world ' s largest animal protein importer, currently importing 27% of the world ' s pork and 24% of the world ' s beef imports.
Ms. Pan said that Chinese beef imports from Australia had increased by 65 per cent in the first half of the year, and China had surpassed the United States and Japan and had become Australia ' s largest beef export market.
Yesterday, the Chinese Government indicated that more pork would be released from emergency reserves before the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party.

Over $100 billion in repurchases by listed companies during the year, the New High in History - Xinhua Network
In order to stabilize the value of the company, preserve the image of the company, marketed companies have frequently repurchased their shares over the past two years and, by means of targeted buybacks and pooling of competitive transactions, wish to transmit to the market the information that the value of the company is undervalued, thereby stabilizing the value of the stock and enhancing investor confidence.
According to the Eastern Wealth Choice data, the amount of money that listed companies used to buy back shares in 2017 increased sharply to $51 billion in 2018, and since 2019, A shares have been repurchased to a total value of over $100 billion, creating a new high in A shares, which has historically been repurchased, far higher than in previous years.
From the point of view of the purpose of the repurchase, the company's repurchase of shares appears to be the same as that of the major shareholders, but there are significant differences in the subject, the source of funds, the purpose of the repurchase, the equity interest itself, etc.
In an interview with a security daily journalist, Xuyang, Chairman of McCorn Information Consulting Limited, Shanghai, stated that in November 2018, the " Opinion on Support to Marketed Companies Repurchases " , which addressed the problems of the existing system, such as narrow stock buybacks, complicated decision-making procedures and inadequate inventory systems, had been repaired and that the return of shares had increased significantly in the year, since the policy had encouraged listed companies to buy back shares.
In January of this year, the " Rules for the Implementation of Repurchases of Shares by Listed Companies " , which were officially published by the House, were introduced to broaden the sources of financing for Repurchase by Listed Companies, to streamline the implementation process, to guide improved governance arrangements and to encourage listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee holding schemes.
After the comments were made, the listed company performed the stock buyback operation with more applicability, easier buyback processes and more incentive to buy back shares.
Repurchase of shares at a relatively low position would also facilitate more efficient use of funds by listed companies, thereby increasing the level of profitability per share, increasing net asset yields and reducing pressure on corporate profitability indicators.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies is even more significant than the increase in the number of major shareholders and reflects the willingness of listed companies to manage their market value and cash flows.
Xuyang believes that undervalued shares are a major factor in repurchases by listed companies, which no longer reflect the future prospects of the company and are therefore of interest to investors, but cannot be invested blindly, and that the financial returns and specific business situations of such listed companies need attention.
Listed companies with large-scale buybacks demonstrate at least the company ' s confidence in development and financial strength.
The repurchase enthusiasm of A-listed companies has also led to a steady increase in repurchase behaviour. The data show that nearly a thousand listed companies have been undertaking stock buybacks this year and that leading companies in various industries have become the main players in the buy-back market.
China recently disclosed the progress of repurchases, stating that the company had accumulated 57.5 million shares in shares in A through a centralized competitive transaction, accounting for 0.315 per cent of the company ' s total equity, and that the total amount of funds disbursed was $5 billion (excluding transaction costs), and that the repurchases would be used entirely for the employee-owned schemes, including, but not limited to, the long-term service plans considered by the company ' s General Shareholder Conference.
Eli shares have been paid $5,792 million for stock buybacks and recently adjusted for repurchases, with the planned "repurchases" of shares being converted to "a cumulative buyback of 183 million shares, of which 152 million were for equity incentives and the remaining 3.04 million were to be written off to reduce registered capital " .
Eli stated that the cancellation of some of the repurchased shares would further raise the level of return per share and effectively increase the return on the investment of the company ' s shareholders.
TCCL issued its Repurchase Progress Proclamation on 25 September, indicating that TCL had accumulated 359 per cent of its shares, at a total cost of $1.65 billion.
The TCL Group Board of Directors office indicated to the "Systems Daily" journalist that the repurchase of shares would be used for employee holding schemes, equity incentives or conversion to stock of corporate bonds issued by listed companies.
TCCL adheres to established business strategies, increasing competitiveness and sustained healthy development.
Based on confidence in the future development of the company and the preservation of investor interests, the company plans to use its own funds, self-financing and other forms of financing to repurchase its shares, taking into account the performance of the company ' s second-tier market for nearly a year and taking into account the company ' s business and financial situation.
According to Yang Delong, the chief economist at the former Kaihang Fund, the repurchase of shares by listed companies, while reducing the number of shares in the market and increasing each share of the earnings of listed companies, is an important benefit for the second-tier market share price; and the willingness of listed companies to take the initiative to extract real gold and silver from the stock market and to buy stocks off the stock market has greatly boosted market confidence.
Repurchases by domestic listed companies have been increasing in recent years, particularly in merit-based shares, and boosting investor confidence through stock buy-backs is a very good way to build up confidence and is a positive and encouraging practice.
The Standing Committee of the Hunan Province, the Governor of Changsha City Council, Hu Heshua, and the four leaders of the engineering machinery manufacturing army — Jan Jun-Shun, Liang Seng-geun, Ho Qinghua, Liu Fei-hyang Xiang, set a "small target" around the "From engineering machinery to intelligent manufacturing" of Changsha — a cluster of engineering machinery that built the world's leading industry three or five years later.
The construction of the world ' s leading engineering and mechanical industry cluster in Changsha, in the current fashion, is "the strongest on the surface."
As the capital city of the Inland Province, Changsha shouts such a powerful word.
It's based on the power of the air leak.
The four engineering machines involved in this conversation, each with its own hands, cover the sky, the earth, the sea, all over the land: the river's smart light plane, the cement transport pump in UCH, the full ground crane for the trio, the tunnel shield for the iron-builder, and its "hard power" as a single step in the world.
Once upon a time, China had virtually no voice in the field of engineering machinery manufacturing.
In time of transition, Chinese companies have introduced "Go Out" two-wheel drive, taking the east wind of the "Away" initiative, buying, merging, building factories, etc., and making a leap into the global engineering and machinery industry.
Of these, three major workers, the Central and Central United Nations, the iron construction and engineering and engineering companies, such as the Mountain River Intelligence, led by their production, market occupancy, sales and other major economic indicators, have taken a significant lead in the same type of enterprise.
It's time to move with the camera.
"Four Great Kongs" is the leader of the cluster of the Changsha Engineering Mechanical Industries and the head of the global engineering and mechanical industry.
In the world's industry, who survives and lives well is the hard way to speak.
In earlier years, the global engineering and machinery industry had suffered a cold winter, and a number of internationally recognized engineering and machinery manufacturers had fallen, but Changsa ' s engineering and machinery manufacturing firms had not only survived, but had strengthened their bodies by using cat winters as winter swims, by putting pressure on themselves, by breaking into their own hands, by transforming their industrial structures and by transforming from manufacturing to ingenuity.
It's based on the unity of the moon.
The development of niche industries requires both active enterprise and government action.
Changsha's reputation for "the capital of engineering machinery" is that it brings together an industry-wide chain from upstream to downstream, creates numerous clusters of related industries and reduces the cost of sales by optimizing the business environment, improving service packages, streamlining the pipeline initiatives such as approval processes, enterprise R & D, manufacturing and marketing.
Good business ecology, bringing engineering and machinery to power.
History has pushed the sand to the front of the world's leading engineering machine, and now it's time for me to say no.
Governments, businesses, and even related producers and researchers should seize opportunities, step up, target and sustain their efforts to contribute to the creation of powerful countries.
Wang Yi chaired the meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of China and the African States members of the Security Council.
Wang Yi said that China and the African countries are good brothers, good partners.
In the past, in the present and in the future, China stands firmly with its brothers in Africa.
We have advocated the convening of such a meeting as a concrete step towards the implementation of the important consensus reached between President Xi Jinping and African leaders at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation last September, in order to strengthen China ' s solidarity with African countries in the Council and to promote better international support for peace and development in Africa.
Wang Yi said that Africa is China's most important and trusted partner.
As a permanent member, China ' s vote on the Security Council has always belonged to the vast majority of developing countries, including African countries.
In the face of the new situation, China is ready to work with African countries in the Council to strengthen solidarity and cooperation in order to safeguard common interests.
The two sides should work together to resolve disputes through negotiation, self-reliance and development.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the African States participating in the Conference thanked China for its initiative to convene the Conference and congratulated the New China on its 70th anniversary.
The Ministers expressed the view that Afro-China relations are based on equality and mutual respect, and that Africa and China have always been the most trusted and trusted partners.
It appreciated China ' s important and active role in African affairs as a permanent member of the Security Council, its strong contribution to a just and reasonable solution of African problems and its great efforts and contributions to the interests of Africa and the promotion of peace and security in Africa.
Africa currently faces the threat of terrorism and extremism, and only by addressing security issues can Africa truly achieve long-term peaceful development ...
Looking forward to further coordination of positions with China in the Council and strengthening of solidarity and cooperation ...
Wang Yi said that there was an important consensus at today's meeting.
We all support the preservation of multilateralism, the strengthening of the authority and role of the United Nations, the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and the rejection of unilateralism and hegemony; we all agree to strengthen mutual supportive cooperation between Central Africa in the affairs of the United Nations and the Security Council in order to safeguard the common interests of Central Africa and the developing countries in general; we all support African countries in their African approach to African problems and call upon the United Nations to provide financial support for autonomous peace operations in Africa; we all support the concept of cooperation for development and development for peace and help African countries to achieve autonomous and sustainable development; and we stand firm in our defence of the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries against any State that creates obstacles for developing countries and denies the right to development.
Gansu Qingyang: The lake sheep came to "get out of poverty."
The autumn of September rewrite the Yellow Terrestrial Plateau.
The 58-year-old villager, Savily, in a professional cooperative for the breeding of the town of Pilgrims, filled the sink with the last straw to watch the white lake sheep chew.
"Beautiful, when the autumn and winter are full, you can sell a good price on the fence. "
Xavilley said he fed the sheep "special feeding" every day, regularly cleaning, disinfecting, and carefully waiting.
Harvey raised sheep for more than 20 years until he came to work in the cooperative to find out how rough the sheep used to be.
Xavilli is from Qingyang City, Gansu province, and from Qingyang County, Xia Ma Town.
His right-hand neighborhood is a sheep-breeding house, but he insists on the traditional way of feeding, the quality of the sheep is poor and the numbers are low.
In June of this year, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative under the guidance of the Government, and everything began to change.
Xavilley's been digging around all day, because he's always holding on to it.
The stockholders are poor households, they trust the sheep to the cooperative, they're counting on him if they can split the money and sell it at the end of the year.
Thanks to the technical guidance, he learned to control the disease, mastered the scientific feeding, became a small breed of the village.
The Specialized Cooperative for Beneficiary Farming is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep sheds with nearly 1,400 lake sheep.
The director of the cooperative, Zou Tao, said there were doors inside and outside the standardized sheep shed.
"The wool is thick, it can breed bacteria, the lake sheep can't stay in a hot, wet place, the shed must be built in a triad, and the windmills must be installed to vent the heat ... "
Zoo-tao said that, in order to prevent the disease, there was a need for regular spraying of sheep sheds to disinfect them and a third to four times a quarter.
In addition to living well, fat sheep have to eat grass mixed with green corn, wheat grass, storks, and have enough wide playgrounds to stretch their bones.
The cooperative adopts a proxy approach that directs local farmers to put good seedlings of lake goats here, unifying them, managing them, marketing them, planting them, scientificizing them, standardizing them, and intensive farming.
Today, 140 poor households in stock-sharing with sheep receive more than $6,000 per household per year, and four card-based poor clients work in cooperatives.
From the word "grazing" to the word "precision feeding", from the word "local mating" to the word " artificial insemination", from the word "skinning" to the word "binging" at the end of the day in Gansu Qingyang the meat and goat farming was more than just a shift in the way of feeding, and the model of the "Longhead + Cooperative + Farmers" changed the image of the once-drawn sheep, marketed sheep, overcome the weakness of the traditional farming industry, and the poor days of farmers were made better by modern sheep.
Zou Tao said that if market prices were weak, the local leader, Gansu Yumong Agricultural and Livestock Development Co. Ltd., would buy it at a price of $27 per kilogram of market protection to help farmers spread market risk.
Xu Jianfeng, General Adviser, Gansu Peking Agricultural Development Ltd., said that businesses had led more and more poor households to read "goats through" by providing loan guarantees to poor households, sheep farming, purchase orders, purchase of offers, uniform processing sales, etc.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families achieved a steady increase in harvests through the cultivation of herbs that thrived in the Convergence, the breeding of good seeds, the cultivation of scale, the division of slaughter, and the marketing of markets.
Qingyang City is in the northern agricultural cross-section, and the grass is abundant.
There are currently 913 sheep-scale farms throughout the city, with cooperatives raising more than 5 million goats, and two 1.3 million goat slaughter-scale processed production lines, which are becoming pro-poor " leader " of the industry.
The French treasurer called for a tax cut of more than Euro10 billion next year and called on Germany to follow up.
Reuter Paris, September 26th - Bruno Le Maire, France, says that France will cut more than Euro10 billion (10.9 billion dollars) next year, while Germany should keep pace with French fiscal stimulus in order to revive the depressed economy.
In presenting France ' s 2020 budget, Le Mel stated that the European Central Bank ' s latest monetary easing initiative had created an opportunity for the Governments of capable member States to increase investment.
The European Central Bank reached a record low on 12 September and plans to re-open its purchase debt in order to reduce borrowing costs in the hope of stimulating economic recovery and boosting inflation.
" Low interest rates will not allow Europe to prosper again, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough, " Lemel says to journalists.
"Germany needs to invest, now, as soon as possible. don't wait until things get worse." He added.
He has made this appeal to Germany many times.
France has implemented tax cuts of more than Euro10 billion this year, which have greatly boosted its economic growth.
And the global economy is losing power, and the export-dependent German economy bears the brunt.
Le Merle pointed out that next year the tax burden on French families will be reduced by €9.3 billion, including €5 billion in income tax relief.
In addition, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by almost Euro1 billion as the rate of corporate tax will be reduced from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent over a five-year period.

Research: The U.S. National Healthy Eating Index has increased slightly, but it still has challenges - the Chinese Net
According to the American diaspora, a recent study in the United States has shown a moderate increase in the United States Government's health dietary index over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58.
But with 100 points, it's not worth celebrating.
American nationals still face a " distinct challenge " in their diet.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Zhang Fang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University, Massachusetts, said that Americans continued to absorb too much food that could cause diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, which are among the most common diseases in the United States.
The study was published in the American Medical Association magazine 24.
The study was based on the findings of a health survey of 44,000 adults conducted by the United States Government between 1999 and 2016.
The authors wrote that " despite considerable improvements, significant dietary challenges persist " .
These challenges are known to include reducing the intake of snacks, hot dogs, fat cattle, butter and other saturated fat foods.
Research has found that the intake of these unhealthy fats in people ' s daily diets has increased from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent, exceeding the recommended 10 per cent limit.
The biggest improvement in the American diet is the reduction of sugar intake from 16 per cent to about 14 per cent, but the intake is still too high.
Officially, sugar supplements should be less than 10% in daily diets.
For the reasons for the decrease in sugar intake, researchers believe that this is associated with a reduction in the use of sweet soda, but Zhang Fong stresses that sugar is often added to food that is not even very sweet, such as yogurt and ketchup.
The intake of fruits, nuts, oatmeal and other all-grain categories by American adults has increased slightly.
However, data from 2016 show that the proportion of food in daily diets is still less than 5%.
Although there has been a slight decrease in salt intake and a reduction in drinking juice has led to low-quality carbohydrates intake, Zhang aromatics indicate that they still account for up to 42 per cent of daily heat, many of which come from processed white bread and other refined grains.
This study is based on every two years of personal health surveys that remind adults of the food they have eaten in the last 24 hours.
These health surveys have been asking this question twice every few days since 2003.
The U.S.-based dietary guide published by the government recommends a " healthy dietary model " to reduce the risk of chronic illness.
The guide states that people should consume more nutrient-intensive foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, as well as seafood, thin meat, poultry meat, eggs, seed food that can provide protein.
The number of people suffering from diabetes in the United States almost doubled to over 7% during the research period, and the obesity rate also increased over the years during the study – today about 70% of adults in the United States are overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among American nationals.
EU promotes strategic partnerships with Asia
Member of the Viet Nam Central Political Bureau, Secretary of the Central Registry, and Minister of the Central Economy, Nguyen Wenping, attended this forum.
In line with the close cooperation between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the theme of the Forum was " EU-Asia interface: building bridges for a sustainable development future " .
The Forum took place one year after the implementation of the catch-up strategy on the two continents of the European Union.
Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, said that enhanced acceptance was part of the above-mentioned idea because of its benefits to the peoples and economies concerned.
This relationship has helped to bring stability and prosperity to the parties concerned.
At the same time, he believes that the EU would like to convey a message about increasing participation and consolidating the mutually beneficial interface between Europe and Asia.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan is a special guest of the Forum and will make an important speech in the plenary.
The country's first stock-management subsidiary has been set up to manage business with technology.
In Qingdao on 26th, the Hwang Da Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary, LLC, was inaugurated as our first stock-based bank's finance subsidiary.
Experts indicated that asset management was an important area for the development of financial science and technology, and that banks had established financial management subsidiaries to enable them to use science and technology to upgrade their operations.
In April of this year, Kwang Da Bank, the comptoir bank, issued a separate announcement stating that it had been approved by the China Silver Insurance Supervisory Board to prepare for the construction of the finance subsidiary.
On September 24, Kwang Da Bank announced that he had been officially authorized to open his business.
In just two days, the Big Light Bank led a number of stock-based banks, leading the way to the establishment of altruistic wealth in Qingdao.
Mr. Lee Xiaoping, Chairman of the Big Light Group, said that the Big Light Group would accelerate the pace of innovation by using modern technological thinking and tools, relying on big data, physical networking, cloud computing, increasing the coverage of financial capital, utilization and penetration, improving customer access, happiness and security.
By 2021, the establishment of the " eight pillars " for sound financial science and technology development in the country will further enhance the capacity of the financial sector to apply science and technology, achieve greater integration of finance and technology, coordinate development, and significantly increase the satisfaction of the population with digitalization, networking, intelligent financial products and services.
Mr. Zhang Xuyang, Chairman of Xuyang Finance, introduced the use of smart investment, smart investment, big data and other technologies in the Quasi Finance Management Platform to help Quasi to better measure the macroeconomic situation.
New technologies, such as block chains, will also be applied in the future to capture the direction and trends from traditional to alternative to digital to alternative assets.
According to Dong Chi-hoon, a special researcher at the National Financial and Development Laboratory, in the face of a new competitive situation in the financial sector, financial technology companies and financial institutions will explore new growth paths using capital science and technology together.
Financial science and technology enabling industries are both a need for financial science and technology to transform its own development and will in turn inject new life and dynamism into the development of its operations.
At the beginning of this year, Kyoto Digital Science and Technology launched a new technology management system to enhance the capacity of capitalized products for research and development and wind control with the help of technology and digitization.
The new system starts with product design, sales transactions, asset management, risk assessment, four major capabilities, and enhances the overall intellectual performance of the industry.
The experts believe that while upgrading client service capabilities and innovation for rich products, S & T can also enhance risk prevention and management efficiency.
Zhang Xiaoyang indicated that the risk preferences used in the past to locate clients through questionnaires were easily biased, and that the current use of artificial intelligence for user drawings helped to better locate clients and to roll out products in line with their investment preferences and to mitigate risks.
"Electrators, data such as space and time can help us better carve out an area, an industry's activity, a landscape... "
Zhang Xuyang said that while addressing risks, big data technology would also help improve wind control.
The deep record of the Chinese railway tunnel is being updated.
After more than 1,200 days of construction, on September 27, China's Sino-News Social Security Hills (Jan Wei Ming Xiao Jingbo) completed the excavation of a well 1 in the Grande Ri (Li) railway mountain tunnel, reaching 762.59 metres below the ground, breaking the record of Chinese railway tunnels, which was created in a flood of water.
The 34.5-km-long Tairyung Hills tunnel is located in Yunnan, and the tunnel is the longest single-clan tunnel in Asia, running through the mountain range of Gorygon in the West Bank.
The tunnel crosses 19 fracture zones and is buried at a maximum depth of 1155 metres, since it covers the undesirable geological and significant risks that may be encountered in almost all tunnel construction, known as the " geological museum " of the tunnel.
The rigs are the most important auxiliary tunnels in the mountain tunnels of the Koligon and are charged with the important task of increasing the operational surfaces to achieve the ventilation of the long and short fights and later railway operations.
The successful excavation of the first rig to the bottom of the well marked the construction of the formal access level tunnel at the Mount Galligan tunnel, which, after the bottom of the well has been opened and replaced, would add four fields of operation to the bottom of the well and accelerate the opening of the tunnel.
" Wells are all over the granite layers, and because of the size of the granite faults, they can't stop the water, they keep flowing from the top to the bottom, and basically the depth of the water pressure of the wells ... "
The Chief Engineer of the Dare Railway Project of the Central Iron and Steel Trail Authority told journalists that the construction of the well had involved a number of mudslides, landslides and other hazards, and that the builders had invited experts to bring the pulses to the field and over 20 discussions on the treatment programme.
" Up to more than 300 cubic metres per hour and more than 700 metres deep in the bottom of the well, with water pressure equal to 700 metres deep in the bottom ... "
" If we don ' t pump the drain in time, we flood the well 10 meters in an hour, we spend almost 85% of our time on water treatment and 15% of our time on digging... "
In order to overcome the geologic problems of vertical development of the rig 1, water surge, water-rich granite, etc., tunnel construction uses a combination of "seek, note, dig" systems to treat water and reduce construction risks.
As a result of several improvements, the construction of the first rig has resulted in the development of an excavator system, a suspension system, a mechanized water flow line such as a gallows upgrade system, which has resulted in an eye strike, a bursting, a bursting, the installation of templates, the construction of concrete, etc., which has accelerated the construction process.
Eventually, after more than 1,200 day and night work, the rig was successfully completed at a depth of 762.59 metres.
The railway is 330 km long and is an important part of the international corridor for Central Myanmar and is an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the "one-way" construction.
With the completion of the traffic, the travel time between Dalian and Reilly will be reduced from 6 hours to 2 hours on the current road, which will significantly improve the transport situation in the Fifi region and will facilitate trade and economic cooperation between China and South-East Asian countries.

It is believed that under the premise of "one country, two systems", Hong Kong will continue to have the advantage of taking advantage of the "one-way" and the opportunities of Hong Kong's Australasia Bay region for a better future for Hong Kong.
She added that during the past few months, Hong Kong had been affected by social disputes and that journalists faced different challenges.
At this critical juncture, it is hoped that friends of the press will continue to face the challenge, be professional, provide justice for society, have a balanced press coverage and do their part to restore rational communication to the future of Hong Kong.
Kang said that the glorious journey of the new China was one of Hong Kong ' s development with its motherland, progress, blood ties, humiliation.

The British tourist car keys fell into the lake, and the whole family was trapped in France for five days.
In recent days, a couple from Wales, England, took two children to France on vacation, accidentally dropped the car keys into the lake, and the family was forced to wait five days to get the new car manufacturer's key.
The couple then left France with the children.
It was reported that on 16 September, local time, when the British family was looking at a lake in France, her daughter accidentally knocked over a bag and the keys to the car in it fell into the lake.
But they took hours and couldn't find the keys.
And all their possessions and cash are locked in the car.
Although British tourists bought insurance before they left, the insurance company refused to help on the grounds that the vehicle was not in danger of theft.
They had to hire a tow truck to take it to a garage and store it and reorder the keys from the car manufacturer.
A few days later, British tourists finally got the key to the match, and the couple took the kids away from France.
Their scheduled journey was cancelled by the loss of the car keys.

Pilot notification of commitment systems in areas such as food production permits for low-risk varieties and devolution of foreign business representation to self-trade zones
On 27 September, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority signed a memorandum of work with the Government of the New District of Pudong, introducing 20 market regulatory reform measures, some of which were the first to be piloted throughout the country.
According to the presentation, the notification of the promise means that the administrative authorities, in matters relating to the registration of permits, shall inform the applicant in writing of the conditions and requirements set out in the laws and regulations, once and for all ...
Once the applicant has signed the promise, the administrative authority can take it directly.
According to the memorandum, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority will support business names registration in the Pudong New Zone and Shanghai Free Trade Pilot Zone, process simple processes, permit food production for low-risk varieties, partially measure device type approval, and inform commitment systems in three areas to facilitate business access.
Shanghai Sino-Hinji Food Co. Ltd. obtained a " food production license " on the spot by means of a notification of commitment and became the first company to benefit from a pilot dividend.
The head of the business said that food permits could also be certified on the spot, and that the "admissibility" approach allowed the company to submit part of the information in accordance with the deadline agreed in the letter of commitment " , " the convenience of the reform was actually felt... "
Shanghai market regulators have indicated that the implementation of a notification commitment system for food production licences is a national pilot.
As a result of the reform, the processing process was reduced from "Registration, Reception, On-site Verification, Sampling, Examination of Materials, Approval of the Certificate" to "Registration, Processing, Approval of the Certificate" by three stages, from 20 working days before the reform to the end of the case.
Taking into account the high economic orientation of the Pudong economy, the Shanghai market regulator delegated the registration authority of the permanent representative body of foreign (regional) enterprises to the Shanghai self-trade zone to facilitate business access.
Statistics show that the decentralization involved a total of 1,592 permanent representative institutions in the Shanghai Free Trade Area, of which 99 were processed in accordance with the new regulations.
"11" long-term fake consumer survey: choice of more diversity, tourism takes top priority.
The state holidays are approaching, and people's vacation plans are being finalized.
The security daily reporter recently launched a small survey in the circle of friends on the 11th holiday arrangement, and almost 20 feedbacks indicate that while people have different plans, "Tourism+Consumption" becomes the key word for the 11th holiday.
Specifically, in the feedback received by the Daily Securities Journal, half of the people chose to travel.
Mr. Liu, who lived in Tianjin, said that " Plan to take his family to Shanghai during the `11' period, Disney was the first stop and then went to the surrounding cities " ; Ms. Li, who was in Beijing, chose to travel to Taiwan, where " a family of three left on September 28th and planned to travel 10 days around the island " ; Ms. Ma, Chongqing planned to travel abroad, with Singapore as its destination; Mr. Zhang and Mr. Hebei chose to travel on their own, saying that " daughters are less than two years old, it is not convenient to go away from their homes, plan to travel themselves to Shandong for a few days at sea " .
The "Report on Trends in Travel and Travel of the Residents of the Golden Week of 2019 Nations" published recently by the same art dragon and the same tour shows that this year's Golden Week is on the move and that there is a clear upward trend in consumption in three sub-areas.
The rate of penetration of aircraft, high-iron travels has steadily increased, as has the ratio of individualized non-target accommodation needs at star hotels.
On September 23, the United States Mission released the 2019th Episcopal Tourism Consumption Trends Report, which showed that tourism consumption continued to flourish and that there was a rise in the diversity of the "live-in" movement.
More young people travel for high quality, special experiences, cultural tourism, night tourism and so on.
In addition to tourism, consumer demand of all kinds was released during the 11th.
Mr. Wang, who lives in Chengdu, told the security daily reporter, "The main plan for this year's 11th is to buy a car."
A Beijing-based car brand, 4S, said to a security daily reporter that, in general, the month of September and October of each year were known as the golden period of car sales.
During the 11th, the store will have a number of events, such as a draw prize, a drop in the shop.
Also, a number of brands have recently introduced new models, and it is expected that the boost to sales will be more visible.
In the context of rising consumption trends, there is greater emphasis on the spiritual level of demand, culture, and rising consumption of services such as education.
" Since the birth of the child, culture, education and consumption have become the head of household spending ...
This year's 11th is a full year. We're going to the Carding Planetarium, the Children's Theatre, a few family weekends camping in tents at the Elk Museum, and we've arranged some auditions. "
According to industry, in theory, the population ' s consumption has evolved along the path of subsistence consumption towards developmental consumption and consumption with a substantial share of the consumption of the enjoyment being in the service consumption category.
As the economy continues to develop and the income levels of the population rise, attention is increasingly being paid to the need for consumption at the spiritual level, tourism and travel is a good way to travel.
Especially on the long holidays of the 11th, with plenty of time, people are more willing to travel and consume, both to meet the need for spiritual consumption and to reflect the rising consumption of the population.
It started this afternoon, and I didn't want to go out, and I didn't get the kids out of town.
Let's get this together and say, "Mommy's taking you out."
He wrote a few details about what he had to do, and the character of blood type A was getting stronger and he felt weird.
Take the suit, buy the nutrients, pay for the raw fish.
That's why we're going out.
On the phone, thanks to the money you've just made for your sister, there's no excuse for buying snacks.
He laughed a few times and said the kid was on the phone and hung up.
Nana jumps on the sidewalk, gets down on the ground, she knows she's sick, scared, and she doesn't want to stay with me.
Her husband, Boo, came back early.
Even the salad that sighed the salmon with butter is good, then went to the bedroom to watch TV on the bed.
Look at the wall, it's 7 o'clock, the sun sets early in the sun. It's dark.
The month was invented in the circle of friends. Today is Mid-Autumn.
Washed a bunch of grapes from a friend, left half to Boo, and the rest in a fancy little flower bowl and went out to see the moon.
Sitting on the ground with Nana, I eat grapes and she eats skin, and I throw up grape seeds far away.
The moon is hidden in the clouds, so good it goes away, and the moon comes out, and it's dark and it's a little stingy.
There's a lot of poetry in your head about the moon, and you only like it clearly: every time you get back together/fullly, you can't get a round of light on the jade bars/the sky.
Maybe we give the moon too much emotion, and for me now, the word God belongs to God, and Caesar's to Caesar is the best.
The moon goes to the moon, the emotions go to you.
After eating the grapes, where's the cold moon?
The Nanas snoring by their feet, standing up, laying Nana's little blanket next to her little house, and Nana groaning on it.
Pull the door and shout: "Do you have the bath?
You can't see the moon from the window of the bathroom, you can only feel the moon, turn off the bathroom lights, pull the glass.
No mooncakes, no drinks.

Starting next year, Chinese students can apply for German undergraduate studies on the basis of their exams.
In recent days, the Anabin database of Germany, which is responsible for evaluating and certifying foreign education, announced in the official network that, starting in 2020, Chinese high school graduates can apply directly for undergraduate studies at German universities on the basis of a high examination, without first having to enrol in national universities.
Prior to that, Chinese high school graduates wanted to apply to German universities and had to study a semester (211,985) or a third term (general undergraduate) in their country, and had passed the APS or TestAS examination.
The release of the new regulations may save Chinese students who wish to study in Germany for at least six months.
It is known that the new regulations will enter into force in the second half of 2019.
Applicants are required to: complete 12 years of formal compulsory education, obtain a high school diploma; participate in exams, higher examinations, with a score of 70% and above (up to 525 if a total score of 750 points) and include two language and one mathematical or natural science achievement requirements.
In addition, the requirements for performance in higher examinations vary from one profession to another.
For example, applying for medicine, oral medicine, veterinary medicine, pharmacology, etc., requires a full score of 80% for advanced examinations and must include mathematics, physics, chemistry, at least two in organisms, or participation in studies; applying for a legal profession requires a full score of 80% for advanced examinations, and must include foreign languages, history, at least two in geography, or participation in studies.
According to incomplete statistics, several countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and others, have now endorsed the Chinese High Tests.
In the United Kingdom, for example, the universities of Cambridge, Birmingham and Leicester all accept Chinese students to apply for higher education.
Military "Machine Dogs" first in the acting class.
The U.S. Army has funded the development of a "machine dog" for the battlefield, and now it's probably the first stage of the circus!
The Circus of the Sun has recently indicated that it is in contact with Boston Dynamics, which is developing robots, to discuss the feasibility of robotic applications for circus performances.
In a comprehensive outside media report, Boston Dynamics published on 24th a promotional film entitled "Spot, a four-foot robot", which shows Spot as a fast mobile robot with a 14-kilogram capacity with high mobility for off-road terrain, 360-degree shielding, navigation, long-range control and autonomy.
In particular, Spot has a unique software platform specifically developed for Spot, and the user can customize the Spot robotic function through various applications.
Boston Dynamics first published the idea of a robot dog in 1992, which caused a sensation, but has still not actually been put into commercial application.
However, Boston Dynamics states that Spot is now in the production phase, with a majority of buyers predominantly in buildings and energy.
In addition, the Solar Circus is currently in contact with Boston Dynamics, which says that the plan is still in its conceptual phase and is assessing the potential of Spot to be used at the performance site.

The White Paper stresses that the path of socialism of China ' s identity is a path based on national circumstances, a path that places the interests of the people at the forefront, a path of reform and innovation, a path of common development in openness and a path of full compliance with the rule of law.

Did Marv take a by-election at the Denver-Ai conference in the state of Johor?
The head of the Maveau General, Datos Li Wei, said: " Let the Supreme Council of the National Front discuss! "
In the near future, the By-election of Dan Qui was a cause for concern as to whether Mawar of the FLN member party would take up the traditional seat of the State.
However, following the meeting of the CMI, it was announced that it would be left to the Supreme Council of the National Front to decide whether the traditional Mawar seat would continue to be taken up by the Mawar Party or replaced by the other members of the Party.
On Thursday afternoon, after chairing the CMC meeting, Wei Xiang Xiang said to the media that any by-elections would be conducted in accordance with the standard operating procedures (SOP), i.e., only after a meeting of the Supreme Council of the NFL.
He said that, since the Election Commission would meet only next Monday (1) to finalize the by-elections for the Danfumi-Ai seat, it was expected that the meeting of the Supreme Council of the Fretilin would take place in early October.
"In the morning of yesterday, I also met with the President of the NFL, Dato ' Seri ' Ammizahi, and we all agreed on the need to regain this seat from the Alliance of Hope... "
" We have finalized the convening of a meeting of the leaders of the Special National Front in early October, where the leaders of the three parties of the National Front will determine which of their members will take part ... "
Asked if Ma Wah would stick to the traditional seat of the Supreme Council of the National Front, Wei Jiaxiang reiterated that, as head of the Ma Wah General, he had to act in accordance with standard operating procedures and that any decision must therefore be based on a consensus of the National Front.
"In any by-election, it is a common thing for people to be willing to march, for political parties and for someone to think that they should come out... "
"The most important thing is what kind of organization and political alliance we come from?"
"This is a great test of our political alliance over the years, and we believe that the Führer has come a long way with some valuable value... "
"In the process, someone might say something, which is not surprising. "
" But once the Supreme Council of the NFL has made its decision, we must all be ready to fight, which is the most valuable... "
In any case, Wei Xiangxiang said that Ma Wah would make every effort to prepare for the coming by-election of the Danfly Pier seat at three levels, namely, the District Council, the State Board and the Central.
" The district council is headed by the chairman of the (Tanfumiai) district council, Dausri-Yung Hel; the state board is headed by the chairman of the Board of Governors of the State of Juju, and the central board is deployed by the head of the board, the director of the board, with the head of the board, and the secretary-general, with the head of the board, with the head of the board, with the head of the board, and the head of the board, with the head of the board, with the head of the board, with the head of the board.... "
Last Saturday, Congressman Tanfumibai of the Indigenous Unity Party, Natomoham Al-Farini, died in a government hospital in stupid Jane, 42 years old.
A village in Pacong County, Hubei, was ordered to hunt wild animals.
A villagers in Paikang County, Hubei, were sentenced for hunting wildlife and ordered to compensate him for the cost of repairing environmental damage to ecological resources in the amount of $15420 (RMK).
Due to the poor families of the accused, the Public Prosecution Service introduced alternative labour to compensate for ecological rehabilitation costs, bringing about an organic harmonization of legal and social effects.
The Deputy Attorney-General of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the County of Boccang, Wang Chong Liang, introduced three months of alternative work, such as "compulsory patrol of mountains", where the accused had established deep feelings with the wild monkeys and was deeply responsible for the previous hunting of animals.
On 21 June of this year, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of the Prefectural District of Boccang filed a criminal case in the field of ecological resources, which was accompanied by civil public interest proceedings, which was heard in the county court and pronounced in court.
The defendant was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment on a week, suspended for four years and fined $3,000, and ordered to pay compensation of $15420 for environmental damage repairs to ecological resources.
According to research, starting late in January 2014, a grid was set up on a cliff to hunt over 20 wild animals, including falcons, pelicans, furry deer, etc.
Abrasives belong to the second-tier endangered wildlife protection animal of the country, Xiaomei, and the coyote is listed as the National Register of Wildlife Conservation on Land.
During the court proceedings, each week confesses to his wrongful facts and conduct and is willing to assume incidental civil liability.
However, in view of the poor economic situation of a family in the past week, the local village council, the forest station, coordinated by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of the Prefectural Department, concluded an agreement on the cost of alternative labour compensation for ecological rehabilitation: the maintenance of the monkeys in the village ' s monkey reserve, the compulsory patrol of the mountains, the protection of the forest for one year, and the provision of public services to cover the cost of ecological restoration.
In response to the prosecutor's recommendation, the court accepted that it would be positive to comply with the obligation to "reimburse ecological restoration costs for alternative labour" in conjunction with the execution of a suspended sentence on a weekly basis.
At present, Monday is three months' compulsory work in the Monkey Reserve, and the patrol is active and performing well.
In recent years, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of the Prefectural Public Prosecutor ' s Office has integrated prosecution functions and social governance practices in practice, using prosecutorial recommendations in science, investigative supervision, litigation monitoring, etc., to minimize ecological damage caused by criminal acts through judicial means.
The United Nations awards the Earthguard Award for the Ant Forest.
In the warm applause and music of ants forest, the director of the ants forest and user representatives of Shen Xiao Ding went to the podium and received from the moderator the 2019 United Nations Earthguard award.
In 2019, the Earthguard Award ceremony was held in New York, United States of America, on 26th, using cell phone applets to engage hundreds of millions of people in environmental action, the Ant Forest project was awarded the Incentive and Action Award.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced its award list at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but the people who participated in the award ceremony on that day were still very excited.
In an interview with a Xinhua journalist, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Ingae Anozen, said that the "ants forest" was an exciting innovation that brought hundreds of millions of people to action to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans could do to the environment.
It connects people and the environment with technology and allows each individual to participate in actions to protect the planet, which will have a huge impact.
The Ant Forest was launched by the Chinese Ants Financial Services Group in August 2016 on the Pay Treasure Platform, where users accumulated "green energy" through low-carbon actions such as online payments for hydropower, and "plant trees" on their mobile phones.
Every time a user grows a virtual tree, ant forest and a public good partner plant a real tree in a deserted area.
By August of this year, 500 million ants forest users had accumulated 7.92 million tons of carbon emissions and planted 122 million trees in areas of desertification.
In the Earthguard Award that day, Costa Rica won an award for national environmental efforts, and Costa Rica ' s President Carlos Alvarado paid tribute to the contribution of the Ant Forest on the spot. " It was impressive to inspire so many people to participate in green action " .
The director and chief executive officer of the ant gold suit, Kenji Ii, said that the Earthguard Award was a recognition of the Ant Forest project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for people to participate in low-carbon lives, an honour that belongs to all participants.
Ishiang said that the ants forest has affected 500 million people over the past three years, and that the ants forest will aim to engage 1 billion people around the world in low-carbon actions over the next three years.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring ways to increase farmers ' income from green water in the mountains.
In addition to providing employment through tree planting, it is hoped that farmers will be helped to achieve higher incomes through agricultural development projects, electric power platforms, etc.
The digitally based pro-environmental model created by the Ant Forest has also been successfully launched by other countries.
In June of this year, the largest electronic wallet in the Philippines, GCash, launched the Philippine version of the Ant Forest to encourage Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon living.
It was reported that GCash, in partnership with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines, Environment and Natural Resources, etc., planned to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within one year of the start of the project.
The Earthguard Award is the highest United Nations prize in the field of environmental protection and is awarded annually.
The Ant Forest was awarded the "Incentives and Action Award" award for the third consecutive year of the Green Innovation Project from China, following the construction of the Sehhan Dam Forest site in China, the demonstration of the village in Zhejiang Province in China, the demonstration of the village in Manjiang Province.
Trade frictions affect the U.S. economy.
The United States economic "performance card" for the second quarter of this year showed a marked slowdown in the growth of the United States gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the previous quarter, as a result of the sharp decline in private sector investment and exports.
Analysts point out that the economic and trade friction and the uncertainty it creates are the main causes of the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revision data released by the United States Department of Commerce on 26 February showed that US GDP grew by 2 per cent at annual rates in the second quarter, which was the same as the revised data previously published but significantly lower than 3.1 per cent in the first quarter.
Data show that consumer growth has become a major factor underpinning growth in the United States in the second quarter.
Individual consumption expenditure, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the total United States economy, increased by 4.6 per cent over the season, driving economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government spending on consumption and investment boosted growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment declined by 6.3 per cent in the second quarter compared to the previous quarter, dragging up 1.16 percentage points of economic growth in the current season; exports fell 5.7 per cent compared to the previous quarter, and net exports slowed down by 0.68 percentage points in the current season.
Barry Knapp, managing partner, Einside Macroeconomic Consulting, United States, said that private sector investment had not kept up the momentum of last year ' s growth, but had declined significantly because of the impact on business confidence caused by increased economic friction and uncertainty.
Knapp believes that, under the influence of policy uncertainty, US corporate capital spending is expected to continue to decline next year.
According to analysts, while consumption growth has strongly supported the United States economy in the second quarter, there are increasing signs that economic friction and the uncertainty it creates have affected consumer confidence and negatively affected consumption prospects in the United States.
Richard Courting, Professor of Economics at the University of Michigan, the head of the survey, had recently stated that 38 per cent of consumers in the most recent survey had spontaneously referred to the negative impact of tariffs on the United States economy, which was a new high in a year and a half.
In terms of future economic trends in the United States, analysts are generally of the opinion that the United States economy will continue to slow down.
However, the view was also expressed that the performance of the United States industrial sector and financial markets would improve if economic friction were eased.
The Global Economist of the British Economist think tank, Karin Burch, predicts that in the future the United States economy will continue its downward trend since this year and will grow at a lower rate than in the second quarter.
The chief economist of Moody Analysis, Mark Zandy, predicts that the economy will grow 2.3 per cent this year, assuming that the economic friction will not continue to escalate, and will further slow down to 1.6 per cent next year.
According to the investment manager of Patnan Investment Corporation, Ellen Hartsing, the biggest concern of enterprises today is the economic and trade dispute and the uncertainty it creates, which would be significantly reduced if it were resolved and the industrial sector would perform much better than it is now.
Matt Melley, a stock strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said that the trade friction remained a " top priority " and was the main cause of the significant volatility of the United States capital market this year, and that the proper resolution of the trade friction would be key to influencing the direction of the United States capital market for the rest of the year.
The first couple in Ningxia can take 10 days a year for parents of children aged 0 to 3 years.
The protection of women ' s legitimate rights and interests is an expression of respect for and protection of human rights and an important sign of the progress of civil society.
On 27 September, at the fifteenth meeting of the Standing Committee of the Twelfth Session of the Ningxia Autonomous Region, the " Regulations on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women in the Ningxia Autonomous Region " was adopted with a high vote.
This is a local regulation issued by the first province of Ningxia to systematically protect the legitimate rights and interests of women, which will be in force as of 1 November 2019.
It is understood that the Regulations adopted on this occasion were amended on the basis of the 2007 Ningxia Implementation of the Measures of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women, and were divided into nine chapters, 65 articles, including general provisions, political rights, cultural and educational rights, labour and social security rights and interests, property rights and interests, personal rights, marital and family rights, legal liability and by-laws.
In the Regulations, Ningxia encouraged the exploration of joint parental leave, which was the first in the country.
In April of this year, the Department of State issued a directive on promoting the development of childcare services for infants under three years of age.
In the course of the revision of the Regulations, Ningxia introduced an innovative proposal to encourage employers to grant 10 days of joint parental leave each year between the ages of 0 and 3 for couples with children, in accordance with the law.
At the same time, the Regulations highlight the fight against sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations, which incorporates the latest legislative achievements in China's current Civil Code body of personality rights, details the constituent elements of sexual harassment, subjects and mechanisms against sexual harassment.
Section 44 of the Ordinance expressly prohibits the frequent sexual abuse of girls and requires educational institutions to provide relevant education, protection and prevention as a new standard for the protection of girls in local legislation.
With regard to the right of women to know and dispose of the common property of the marital family, article 35 of the Ordinance clearly establishes the right of women to know the common property and the obligations of property registers and related entities to provide solid institutional support for women ' s rights.
In addition, in response to the social issue of gender discrimination in employment, article 26 of the Ordinance prohibits not only direct discrimination but also indirect discrimination, and draws on recent experience of joint interview practices to strengthen penalties for gender-based discrimination violations and to strengthen the protection of women ' s legitimate rights and interests.
In recent years, the work of the Ningxia Women ' s Federation Joint Public Prosecution Division, civil affairs and others in promoting and introducing social expertise in the mediation of marital and family disputes and in combating domestic violence has been very effective.
The Regulations summarize and promote this by encouraging the mobilization of social forces and the pooling of social resources for the protection of women's rights and interests, and by requiring people's governments at and above the county level to provide stable, institutional guarantees and support, including through the purchase of services.
Inner Mongolia, the UNITA Yuan Long Pilgrim workstation is resistant to saline rice rice.
The journalist was informed by the UNITA Administration Administration in the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia on 27th of the good news that the "Saline Rice Testing and Evaluation Council at the UNITA Yuan Long Pilgrim Workstation" recently held by the Allies had reached 1,000 pounds of average saline rice production.
A team of six experts from the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences of Heilongjiang Province, Yangzhou University and the Rural Agricultural Department of Hunan Province conducted a sample harvesting of "Saline Series" rice on site.
According to expert evaluation, the average yield of saline-resistant rice on a pH of 8.8 to 9.6 is 508.8 kg on a land with a salinity content of 5 to 6 per 1,000.
" We intend to build on this year ' s experiment with innovation and reform to recubate and optimize salt-resistant rice varieties to make them better quality and produce more productive ... " .
The researcher, Vice-President of the Agricultural Academy of Heilongjiang Province, who is the head of the Group of Experts on Production Surveys, said, " Without changing the factors of production, I believe that the continued intensification of the scientific and technological offensive will continue to produce miracles on the saline ... " .
UNITA is part of a cluster of special hardship areas in the Great Euphoria and the South.
In October 2018, the Yuan Long Pilgrim worked for UNITA to unveil his medal.
S.Y. Yuan led the team of experts to accelerate the introduction of the newly developed "saline-resistant hybrid rice" varieties and advanced technologies, build 960 acres of saline-resistant rice bases in the right wing of Kolgun, use side-test demonstration, and promote technology routes to boost the productivity of the local poor and lift them out of poverty.
This field-testing of salt-resistant rice not only provides a scientific basis for the upgrading of UNITA salt-based low- and medium-yielding fields to high- and middle-yielding fields, but also for the cultivation of saline rice under the same conditions in the country.
As reported by the Australian Network, the new state of Australia passed the Abortion Legalization Act on 26 September local time, after a marathon debate and weeks of protests.
It is known that the bill has generated political debate over the past eight weeks and that there have been serious differences within AFP since the bill was announced by independent member Greenwich.
It was reported that, after nearly 40 hours of discussion, the Australasia Senate passed the Abortion Legalization Bill by 26 votes to 14 on the night of 25, making it the third-long bill to be considered by the new state Senate.
In the morning, after a final vote in the House of Representatives of the new state, abortion was legalized in the new state.
The Act allows a woman to terminate her pregnancy on the 22nd week of pregnancy and, if two doctors agree, to have an abortion later in pregnancy.
An amendment was passed by the Senate on the evening of 25th night whereby doctors can seek advice from the multidisciplinary team of the Hospital Advisory Board before performing an abortion for a woman after 22 weeks of pregnancy.
In addition, amendments adopted by the Senate include the need for doctors to provide appropriate care for babies who survive termination of pregnancy.
Previously, the Governor of the new state, Berridgelyn, had faced public criticism from conservatives on the bill and had intervened on many occasions to gain more debate for the bill, but she had not been present at the final vote.
" I need time to run the whole new state... "
It has been reported that AFP Congressman Davis was the strongest opponent of the abortion bill and threatened to withdraw from the new state government because of the bill and claimed that it triggered a " government crisis " .
But then Davis gave in.
Davis said: " The content of the amendment to the Abortion Legalization Bill submitted to the House of Representatives on the morning of 26 provides more guarantees for women and doctors ... "
Meanwhile, the leader of the New Australian National Party, Bari Laro, said he was proud to be a member of the government that legalized abortion.
" Our achievements last night are historic for the new state, which legalizes abortion, which is no longer a criminal offence and does not treat abortion women as criminals... "

Today, the Cantonese People's Government and the Trinity Group held a signing ceremony for the project.
Three groups invested $15 billion in industrial projects such as the smart steel industry, oil intelligence equipment and regional research and development centres (headquarters bases), engineering machinery and second-hand vehicle markets, which are expected to produce more than $200 billion annually.
A total investment of $10 billion in the location of the Trinity Steel Industry project in the Hodang region will focus on creating the largest steel and product trading centre throughout the province and in the centre, as well as the Trinity Metal Structures Smart Manufacturing Centre; a total investment of $5 billion in oil intelligence equipment and a regional R & D centre (headquarters base) project will lead to the identification of water ponds and will focus on the construction of an oil intelligence equipment production base and the construction of a regional R & D centre and headquarters base.
At the same time, the Trinity Group will build a second-hand vehicle market for engineering machinery at the Gas Park in the Highland District of Thaci and will cooperate pragmatically in areas such as smart manufacturing.
Cantonese City attaches great importance to cooperation with the Triads.
The city listed cooperation projects as " Project No. 1 " , which was introduced throughout the city this year by the city ' s commission ' s secretary, Mau Ten Fei, led by the mayor, Yang Wei Nation, to set up a dedicated coordination group to effectively connect, promote high-level positions and provide high-quality and efficient services for the development of the Trinity Group ' s land of origin, from the point of contact to the formal signing of the cooperation agreement, less than 100 days before and after.
Minister of Finance Liu Quan: 67 U.S. enterprises and financial institutions have transferred $8.601 billion to strengthen the Social Security Fund.
According to the Minister of Finance, Liu Quin 27, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have now completed transfers of part of the State-owned capital enrichment fund, totalling approximately 86.1 billion yuan in State-owned capital.
Liu Qun made the above statement at the deployment of the National Capital Enhancement Fund for Social Security, a part of which was transferred by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the National Finance Committee.
" The transfer of a part of the State-owned capital, the Social Security Fund, is an important initiative to reform and improve the basic pension insurance system. It is an adequate reflection of the results of State-owned enterprise development and of the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system. It is an ongoing and long-term policy measure... "
In 2017, the State Council issued the " Programme for the Implementation of the National Capital Enhancement Fund " , which calls for the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces to be piloted.
According to Liu Quin, the pre-transfer process has yielded positive results.
At the central level, three transfers of 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have been completed, totalling approximately 86.1 billion yuan in State-owned capital.
Of these, the transfer of central financial institutions in which the Ministry of Finance performs the functions of funder has been largely completed.
Central business transfer has reached a certain scale.
At the local level, business pre-transfers are carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, the Zhejiang pilot project in Yunnan Province was almost complete, transferring State-owned capital of $15.8 billion and $18.5 billion respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, preparatory work has been carried out successively in other provinces to prepare for the next transition.
According to a joint circular issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State Finance Committee, the General Tax Administration and the CVM, the central and local transfer of part of the State capital to the SSF was fully rolled out in 2019 and substantially completed by 2020.
The meeting that took place on that day resulted in a specific deployment of the full rollover.
It was emphasized that the transfer process should be carried out in a pragmatic and efficient manner.
"According to the schedule, the transfer is to be substantially completed by 2020...
The transfer of working hours is tight and the task is heavy ... "
Liu Quin said that in all regions, the departments should be well organized and well organized to ensure that the transfer was completed as required; work should be carried forward in a firm manner to accurately capture the content of the transfer policy; and communication coordination should be strengthened to resolve problems in a timely manner.
The transfer of state funds to the SWF — starting with the SWF money bag — is intended to provide strong support for old-age security.
However, in my opinion, this is not a simple "physical shift " of equity, but a "mathematical addition " .
On 20 September, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the National Finance Committee, the General Tax Administration, the CVM jointly issued a " Circular on the Full Transfer of Part of State Capital to the Work of the Social Security Fund " , specifying the schedule of the State Transfer Fund, i.e., the Central and Local Transfer of Part of State Capital to the Work of the State Capital to the Full Extension of the Social Security Fund in 2019.
After the documents were published, departments such as the Ministry of Finance were implemented very quickly.
On 25 September, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10 per cent of the holdings of business banks, agricultural banks, to the Social Security Fund, with two shares transferred to a total value of over $115 billion.
Under the Act, subjects such as the Social Security Foundation, as financial investors, enjoy the right to receive, dispose of and have access to the State shareholdings allocated to them.
In its bulletin, the WB stated that this change of interest would not result in a change in the owner ' s shareholders and the person who actually controls it.
In response, the author argues that a similar transfer of public entrepreneurship is not a simple change in the attribution of equity, but rather a "additional algorithm " that triggers a series of effects.
The "plus result " of the first step of some national transfers would naturally reflect the national ownership of State-owned enterprises and the sharing of development results.
After many years of reform, the country ' s enterprises, and especially the Venezuelans, are mostly in important sectors and areas of our economy, with greater overall profitability and stability.
Among them, the pioneers are continuing to be good at doing things.
On 10 July, the Standing Meeting of the State Council decided that the transfer of part of the State-owned capital to the work of the Social Security Fund would be fully rolled out this year.
The Ministry of Finance then indicated that, in accordance with the deployment of the Standing Committee of the State Council, the full transfer of part of the State-owned capital to the Social Security Fund would be carried out in full, reflecting the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system and the universal sharing of the results of State-owned enterprise development.
The second step of the transfer, the " plus result " , is to enhance the sustainability of our social security fund and further strengthen the foundations of the social security system for old age.
With the ageing population, our social security funds are under pressure, and most of the country ' s national resources, which have been transferred to the main subject, have sustained profitability and redibility, not only to effectively replenish the Social Security Fund, but also to provide a source of water for the Social Security Fund.
It has been calculated that a reduction of 1 percentage point in the contribution rate to the basic pension insurance of enterprises is supported by the transfer of 3.8 percentage points of State-owned capital.
The third step of the transfer, the "plus result " , is to add stabilizers to the capital market.
The way the transfer is made by the main recipient of the proceeds is by "sharing the proceeds and operating them " .
The Social Security Fund, as a financial investor in State-owned capital, does focus on obtaining equity dividends.
However, as a value investor in capital markets, the Social Security Fund has a strong capital capacity.
For listed assets in State-owned capital, the participation of SSF in the holding of shares will further optimize corporate governance structures of listed enterprises, contribute to upgrading the level of business operations and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the increase in the weight of the equity held by the Social Security Fund, as an investment destination, has helped to further enhance its market influence and to act as a stabilizer in the market.
In addition, it is conducive to the full realization of the "value discovery" function of institutional investors, leading investors to invest rationally, to invest in value.
Karl Hartmann was 18 years old at the Leipzig School of Music, followed by a teacher from Webern.
When the Nazis came to power, Hartmann resisted first in the form of a non-publicized work in Germany, and then even stopped making it.
In 1933, he created Miserae and dedicated it to my long-sleep friends.
In 1935, this symphony was first played in Prague, but was harassed by Nazi bureaucrats.
After that, Hartmann was determined not to play any of his works under Nazi rule.
Hartmann's funeral concerto was a violin and string concert song, when the manuscript was stolen from Germany and the premiere was held in Switzerland.
Please listen to the funeral concert at the Beethoven Music Festival in 2018 at the Berne House Orchestra.

The result was 53 votes in favour and 44 against, and no Democrats voted in favour of Scalia.

Scalia will replace Alexander Acosta.
Acosta, then Minister of Labour, announced his resignation in July of this year, under great pressure from public opinion, for the " leniency " of the billionaire Jeffrey Eppstein of the United States who was accused of sexual abuse and trafficking of young girls.
Scalia is now 56 years old and a partner in a well-known law firm in the United States, whose father is Antonin Scalia, the late Chief Justice of the United States Federal Supreme Court.

In accordance with the procedure, Gener's nomination is subject to approval by the Senate of the National Assembly.
The Federal Emergency Response Agency, which is part of the United States Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for coordinating federal government resources to deal with and follow up on natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other emergencies in the United States.
Since the first parade on the 35th anniversary of the National Day, every time a major parade is organized, there'll be a "massive" force of strategic missiles.
"This National Day parade was the first time that a rocket army had opened up after the army's change. "
Captain Wong Bo of the Rockets and Equipment Unit said...
The missile-reading forces have been able to carry out their special sufferings and combat, with special dedication, intensive training, scientific training, military training throughout the course of their training.

This military parade, which builds on past experience, breaks the mindset, breaks down the traditional approach, uses satellite positioning, laser ranging, high-level imaging, real-time speed measurement, etc., to upgrade training levels and quality efficiency, and to ensure that personnel vehicles are integrated, that the teams operate in a single second, and that they are more responsive to actual standards of engagement.
The rocket army is subject to the same standards as the military parade and launch site, and is more demanding, keeping every gate close to every detail, allowing the army to undergo a scaffolding and truly making the national parade field a training ground and a test ground to enhance the force ' s combat power.
Iran has been confirmed to be developing advanced centrifuges to further suspend the implementation of Iran's nuclear agreement.
According to the Central News Agency, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported on 26 September that Iran had once again violated Iran's nuclear agreement by using advanced centrifuge mechanisms to enrich uranium.
It is reported that Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the Iran nuclear agreement in response to the withdrawal of US President Trump from the Iran nuclear agreement in May 2018 and the resumption and strengthening of sanctions against Iran.
Iran suspended two other commitments in July to keep its uranium enrichment stock below 300 kg and its purity below 3.67%, and now moves further.
In accordance with the nuclear agreement, Iran has been able to accumulate uranium through the installation of only about 5,000 first generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz, and has been allowed to use only a small number of more advanced types of aircraft for research, but not for the production of enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, possibly for the manufacture of nuclear bombs.
According to reports, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that: " On 25 September, the Agency has confirmed that Iran ' s advanced centrifuges of type 2, 3 of the R & D machine are accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium ... "
The report was presented to Member States by the International Atomic Energy Agency on 26th, and a diplomatic official responded: " They are busy at the Natanz enrichment facility ... "

The first hundred-degree auto-pilot taxi teams started a pilot operation.
Yesterday, 100 degrees in Changsha announced that the pilot operation of Autopilot Robotaxi was officially opened.
The first 45 Apollo, developed jointly with a red flag, started to run the Red Flag EV Robotaxi convoy at the open test section of Changsha.
As of that date, ordinary Changsha citizens will be able to access the Apollo network and apply to become seed users and have the opportunity to test their experiences.
An experienced passenger said he was in the back of the vehicle, clicking on the front screen of the passenger seat, and one button opened the autopilot of the vehicle.
In the car, in order to ensure the safety of passengers and the current policy and regulations, a pilot vehicle is provided with a safety officer at the driver ' s seat to maximize passenger safety.
In the process, vehicles can make intelligent diversions depending on the condition of the road, and they can also determine the condition of the vehicle in the surrounding area and make automatic concessions in cases such as proximity.
Throughout the experience, passenger area screens show real-time pedestrians, cars and even some traditional blind areas.
Even the vehicle's cover, it's in advance of the red light changes and waiting times. All traffic conditions are clear.
Unmanned people have heard of it on television before, thinking it's far away from us, but today it's amazing to find it in our lives.
We look forward to its future as a true step into the lives of the people.
In June 2019, Apollo obtained 45 manned test plates issued by the Changsha municipality.
At present, Changsha's autopilot tests open roads through the City of Changsha's artificial intelligence cities, Lake May Creek, Lake Ocean Lake, Wangshan, High New Zone, etc., with a full length of 135 kilometres and a demonstration area of 70 square kilometres, are currently the longest, largest, most complex areas of Chinese roads, and the most sophisticated intelligent driving demonstration areas of the road co-ordinated infrastructure.
By the end of 2019, the Apollo Robotaxi convoy is expected to cover approximately 50 km of the pilot road in Changsha, with plans to cover 135 km of the road currently open in the first half of 2020.

But after the game, Coach Ping, the female platoon leader, still expresses his dissatisfaction with the third game of the team.
"The third game has increased the aggressiveness of the hairball, and some of us can't hit the ball without it, and we've made a lot of mistakes. "
"To fight with the strong, you've made so many mistakes, it's hard."
He was interviewed after Ranpingsi said:
"We told the team to focus on the attack, we're going to get the re-attack done, and we're going to fight each other."
Ruan Ping also commented on Zhang Changning's performance, saying that she had some difficulties in attacking, was more anxious, was too desperate to kill the ball, and her movements were changed.

China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.
White Paper: China ' s development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.
The White Paper states that China ' s development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.
According to the White Paper, as China ' s combined national power and international influence increased rapidly, some people at the international level feared that China would follow the path of "the powerful and the powerful" and some raised the so-called "China threat doctrine".
It's both cognitive misconceptions, deep-rooted prejudices, and psychological imbalances resulting from the strength to grow, as well as deliberate distortions to defend their vested interests.
Achieving national prosperity, national renewal and the well-being of the people is both a dream of the Chinese people and a common dream of all peoples.
" China ' s development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world ... "
The White Paper states that China is the main stabilizer and engine of world economic growth, that China is the largest contributor to world economic growth, that China ' s scientific and technological innovation has injected new energy into world economic growth, and that the future role of China ' s economic stabilizer and power source has become more prominent.
The current world economy is not sufficiently dynamic and a robust Chinese economy is becoming increasingly important to the world.
China ' s economy is moving from high-speed growth to high-quality development, new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, modernization of agriculture, deep restructuring of the economy, continuous upgrading of industrial excellence, and the emergence of new growth points.
" The McKinsey Global Institute study concludes that by 2040, the integration of China and the rest of the world ' s economies is expected to generate between $22 trillion and $37 trillion in economic value, equivalent to 15 - 26 per cent of the global economy, and that enhanced cooperation among the rest of the world ' s economies and China will create enormous economic value ... "
The White Paper stresses that the Chinese economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and have been deeply integrated.
China, with a more stable economy, a higher quality of growth and a more promising growth outlook, is a long-term benefit to the world ' s economic development.
Considering China ' s economic development as a "threat" and "challenge " , trying to squeeze China out of global industrial chains, supply chains, value chains, and delinking China from the world economy is unworkable and harmful.
The White Paper states that full openness creates more opportunities for countries to share the Chinese dividend.
China is firmly committed to a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy, with a stronger and higher level of openness to the outside world, with China having the world's most potential consumer markets, and China being the most attractive destination for investment, with larger-scale "go-out" benefiting more countries.
"Opening should be two-way, mutually beneficial, not one-way, one-way.
Two mutually beneficial directions can last for the long term ... "
The White Paper states that China is committed to continuously expanding imports, liberalizing market access, improving the business environment and enhancing intellectual property protection, and that other countries should expand their openness and take corresponding initiatives in an effort to improve their business environment.
It is only by moving together that an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment can be created, and that the bigger the "cake" of development, the greater it becomes, the more beneficial it will be.
According to the White Paper, China provides more public goods to the international community.
This includes the promotion of high-quality " one-way " , the establishment of multilateral platforms for dialogue and cooperation, active participation in international and regional affairs, and active foreign assistance.
" China has benefited from the international community ' s development and has never forgotten to give back to the family of nations in order to provide the international community with more and better public goods ... "

The Russian side expressed its willingness to export construction technology and high-tech construction materials to China and to develop cooperation with China in areas such as pharmaceuticals and air manufacturing.
Russia and China also have great potential for cooperation in the field of urban environmental development.
He stressed that Russia ' s products in many areas were "quality superior and price competitive compared to their Western counterparts " .
Referring to the two countries ' goal of achieving $20 billion in bilateral trade by 2024, Slepniov said that areas such as agriculture, mechanical manufacturing, the chemical industry and forestry would play an important role in achieving that goal.
The Russian side is interested in promoting diversification of supply in these areas and the export of highly processed products.
He stressed that the Russian side intended to facilitate the entry of its exporters into the global value-added chain, in which China was one of the directions of development.
Russian manufacturers in agriculture, metallurgy, petroleum gas and chemicals are well placed to participate in this process.
There is a need for the two countries to continue to deepen cooperation between enterprises and " establish more joint Russian-Chinese ventures and jointly develop exports to third countries " .
Slepniov indicated that Russian export centres are providing support for exports of Russian products to China through various measures and services undertaken by the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Export-Import Bank.
At the same time, the Russian Export Centre will continue to deepen its cooperation with the relevant Chinese sectors in order to promote easier access for Russian goods to the Chinese market and to develop new types of exports to China.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to Taiwan 's so-called diplomatic breakthrough: sneering self-defeating.
In response to the recent arrival of Taiwan personnel at United Nations Headquarters for meetings on religious issues, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China responded at a regular press conference that the small move was a disgraceful and laughterful one.
Questions were asked by journalists and, according to the media reports from Taiwan, members of the Taipei office in New York had recently entered United Nations Headquarters to participate in meetings on religious issues held in the United States, calling them " diplomatic breakthroughs " .
The meeting you mentioned was a United States side event on the premises of the United Nations, not a United Nations meeting at all.

The database contains more than 60,000 wonderful stories, ranging from the traditional story of "Travity to the Nation" and "Friendless Mountain" to "I'm going without me" of the new era, and thousands of good Chinese stories become living carriers of "The Chinese Spirit" and "The Chinese Wisdom" and "The Chinese Power".

The reporter learned from the online launch of the US-US-China Good Story database, held today in Kyoto, that the "China Good Story" database has a Chinese-English website and a mobile phone client.

The authorities have shown strong repression.
Twitter hashtags and social media are strongly advocating that Egyptians take to the streets today and peacefully demand the resignation of President Sessi.
But the authorities have indicated that they intend to use force to suppress it.
Since the military coup of Cessi, then head of the military, took power in 2013, expressing dissent has almost disappeared in Egypt and any form of protest is more dangerous than ever.
The British Guardian reported that the Cairo NGO, the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, had said that more than 1900 people had been arrested since last weekend's rare protests calling for Ceci to step down.
The allegations of corruption around Cessy and his family's profane pursuit of vanity have led thousands of people to demonstrate on the streets since 20 years.
The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior firmly stated yesterday that any attempt to destabilize the country would be met with determination and would never be soft.
The city centre of Cairo is already heavily guarded, with riot police, security agency vehicles and plain-clothes policemen visible in the streets around Tahrir Square, where the Egyptian revolution detonated in 2011.
Al-Jazeera reported that security forces detained several leading scholars and social sages on 25 days, including Professor of Political Science at Cairo University, well-known columnist Nafa.
" I have no doubt that continued absolute rule over Cessi will cause disaster ... " .
"It is in Egypt ' s interest that he be removed immediately... "
Prior to Nafa's arrest, Hosni, a spokesman for the former Egyptian military chief of staff, Annan, was detained.
Anna was arrested last year after he tried to win the presidency with Ceci.
The president of the Constitutional Party, Davud, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe that, at a time of heightened economic hardship for the poor and the middle class, the scavenging of dissent reflects the instability and fragility of the government.
Opposition leader Ayman Nour, who once contested the presidency, said: " The catch-up underscores the regime ' s disregard for the Egyptian people and its own fear ... "
"Because the economy has been ruined by him, combined with widespread political oppression, Ceci has tried to send a clear message to key generals and politicians who might replace them... "
Noor points out that, given the continuing deterioration of the socio-economic situation, the Government ' s high-handed approach will only increase people ' s anger.
Now that the barrier of fear has been broken, he expects more people to go to the streets.
Ali, a businessman and actor currently in exile in Spain and formerly a contractor for construction in the Egyptian military, began to upload a series of films early in the month, claiming to benefit from the corruption of the Government, which triggered a small wave of demonstrations in different cities last weekend.
Ali said that his company, Amlak, did not have to go through the required bidding process to obtain a profitable contract, emphasizing the corruption of the military and of his relatives, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was very sorry to have been involved in it.
Ali claims that his help to the Fulfilled Palace and the luxury hotel in Sessiga stands in stark contrast to the abject living conditions of Egyptians today, and that the other side has not paid.
On Twitter, such thematic labels as " Stand up and you're not alone " , "Sessy you're fucked " , "Sexy rolls " , "Next Friday" have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and pushbacks calling for people to go to the streets peacefully and ask for Sessi to step down.
There are almost 7 million followers on the Twitter of Amarwick, a Hollywood Egyptian boy.
He wrote in Arabic yesterday: " Ceci is doomed... he is finished, and those who support him are now making a big mistake... "

You're tired of sports too?
According to the Russian satellite network, a study of athletes showed signs of fatigue in the brain as a result of high-intensity motion.
The study, led by Mathias Pescigrion, an expert at the Petier-Sarpetrélé Hospital in France, shows that there is a invisible link between mental and physical labour: both require cognitive control of activities.
Percigrion explains: " You need to control the autonomous process of forcing yourself to stop when muscles and joint pains... "
The study was launched by the French National Institute for Physical Education and Physical Education (INSEP).
The school specialist guides athletes to prepare for the Olympics.
Some athletes have begun to suffer from excessive training syndrome, which is an insufferable sense of fatigue following high-load movements, inability to recover and a decline in achievement.
INSEP asked the question: Is this disease partly due to nervous fatigue, the kind of nervous fatigue caused by excessive mental labour?
This study is published in Contemporary Biology.

Make it easier for Chinese citizens to "go out" - visit Choi Ai-min, Director of Consular Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Wherever you go, the country is behind you.
On 25th, the first Ministry of Foreign Affairs consul protection short film was on the line, and this phrase at the end of the short film was echoed by a wide range of netizens.
In an interview with a Xinhua news reporter, Choi Aimin, Director of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that the short film was intended to further make the public feel the love and the warmth of "diplomaticism for the people" and to make Chinese citizens feel that, regardless of whether they were in any corner of the world, Chinese diplomats would extend their help, strength and hope.
There's nothing wrong with being safe overseas.
According to Choi Emin, over the past 70 years, the number of Chinese citizens "outing" has increased dramatically, from "less than a million a year" before reform to more than 100 million a year today; at the same time, the safety of Chinese citizens travelling abroad is more secure, and consular protection and assistance are being extended from overseas Chinese to Chinese residents, tourists, students, workers, etc.
According to statistics, since the party ' s eighteenth birthday, we have organized more than 10 major evacuations or relocations of Chinese citizens abroad, resulting in the safe evacuation of more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and volatile areas.
About half a million requests for assistance were received and coordinated, involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens.
In times of danger, the country can take you home; it's not a dream anymore.

In the United Kingdom, Belgium jointly introduced visa one-stop service, while France, Italy and Singapore reduced visa processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
The APEC business travel card is a good option for business people who often leave the country, enter the country multiple times.
According to Choi Emin, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining visas for more than five years in 16 economies around Asia and the Pacific, and it means a lot to business people, especially private business people, to "go out".
At present, China holds the highest number of valid cards in the APEC economies.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocity agreements, promote more visa facilitation measures for Chinese citizens, translate more of the results of diplomatic work into initiatives for the benefit of the civilian population, and continuously increase the " gold content " of Chinese passports.

Two months after being held by Iran, the British tanker Stanna Empire was finally released and departed from Iran's port of Abbas in the morning for international waters.
In the middle of last month, the Gibraltar authorities of the British Overseas Territory released an Iranian tanker held for more than a month.
According to the news agency of the Islamic Republic of Iran, at 9 a.m. local time 27 a.m., the British oil tanker Stanna left the port of Abbas for international waters in the Persian Gulf.
The Iranian Port and Shipping Organization of Hormuzgan Province confirmed that the commander and crew of the ship had made a formal and written commitment that, although the ship was seized, they had no claim.
Stena Bulk, the Swedish owner of the Stanna Empire, also said that the ship was sailing from the port of Abbas.
In addition, Refinitiv's vessel tracking data also found that the tanker had begun to move and left the port of Abbas.
This British-flagged tanker, Stena Impero, was seized by Iran in July this year.
The spokesperson for the company said that the tanker was preparing to leave the port of Abbas.
Two weeks after the British seized an Iranian tanker in the waters of Gibraltar, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards detained the tanker, Stefana Impero, in the channel of the Strait of Hormuz.
The ship was released in August.
Earlier this week, the spokesman for the Iranian government said that all the legal proceedings required for the release of the Stanna Empire had been completed.
But the Iranian side says the investigation is still ongoing.
Many Iranian media outlets have also released videos of the tanker's departure.
On 19 July, the IRGC Navy detained a British tanker, the Stanna Empire, inside Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz and then transported it to the port of Abbas.
The Iranian tanker Grace One is off the coast of Gibraltar.
In addition, on 4 July, the Gibraltar authorities of the British Overseas Territory seized the oil tanker Grace One in the Strait of Gibraltar, carrying Iranian crude oil, on the grounds that it had been transporting oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions.
More than a month later, on August 15, the Gibraltar authorities announced the release of Grace One.
This afternoon, a conference was held in Changsha on the theme of the educational review and rehabilitation of undergraduate colleges throughout the province.
The Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial Council, Uran, stressed the need to improve political positions, strengthen political commitment and change from a rigorous examination of the real problems, to promote the effectiveness of thematic education in the construction of the High School Party and the development of quality development in the areas of political thinking and reform.
Uran has fully recognized the initial results of the second series of thematic education by undergraduate colleges.
She noted that education on the theme "Don't forget the beginning, remember the mission" was a major deployment in the party's centre, and that the Xi Jinping secretary-general had to study in depth to follow up on the important message of education on the theme "Don't forget the beginning, remember the mission".
From " Four Awarenesss " to " Two Maintenances " , to the political heights of the original mission, to the careful completion of the thematic education provisions, especially the series of problems identified, to the integration of school reform and development efforts, and to the " promotion of the two " .
Uran stressed the need to keep the blade in the ground, catch the problem, look at the table in accordance with the requirements of the four cross-checks, ask for advice from teachers and students, parents and all sectors of society, and examine the root causes in a serious and profound way, so as to define the direction and improvement of the efforts, with the hard means to solve the problem.
Just stick to precision, strengthen real change, and keep the word "changed" in line.
We need to combine thematic education with work like the Leeds and make sure that the problem remains intact and that the change is effective.
It is important to maintain both the symptoms and the rules, to improve the long-term mechanisms, to bind the system, to strengthen the rigidity of the system, to ensure that it is governed by rules, rules, and that it is truly managed by the system.
At the same rate, leaders take the lead in strengthening the theoretical force, take the lead in critical reviews, take the lead in discipline, play the role of "key minorities" and try to complete the task of thematic education.
Five high school party committees, including Hunan University, were in charge of comrades, and the provincial unit in charge of comrades made a statement.
Two major high-pressure projects.
On 26th day, the direct transmission of electricity to the northeast to the south of the country ~ 1,100 kV, and the Sutton 1,000 kV communications high voltage of the GIL integrated hall project were delivered.
Both projects, which now occupy high points in each of the world ' s power transmission technologies, will result in a significant increase in the country ' s energy-wide optimization configuration.
Guo Ji, Chief Economist of the National Energy Agency, said that Goo Dong-Yunnan was the world ' s largest power provider and the most distant transmission project.
Their delivery is important for promoting Xinjiang energy base development and securing the supply of electricity in the East China region.
GIL, the gas-insulated metal closed transmission lines.
The Sutong Gallery project, which created the highest global voltage and transmission record of the GIL project, achieved the combined operation of the two-circle communication ring with the highest voltage level of the Chinese backbone grid.
According to the National Electricity Network, 3324 km of electricity transmission ranged from Para-East to Xuannan.
Using conventional technology, more than 15 per cent of electricity will be lost in transit, and the project has been developed through closures, raising the economic transport distance significantly to more than 3,000 kilometres.
Once delivered, it can deliver 100 million degrees of electricity every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which can help solve the problem of the depletion of the new energy sources available in Xinjiang.
According to full-load estimates, this line will reach between 60 and 85 billion kilowatt hours per year, which will cover more than half of Shanghai ' s electricity use throughout the year.
The Sutton GIL Integrated Concourse Project is the control work of the ultra-high pressure communication ring across the Yangtze.
Using conventional empty lines across rivers, two giant towers of over 450 metres above the Yangtze River and an artificial island of more than four football fields per tower will be required.
In response, the national grid has been boldly innovative in developing compact super-voltage exchange technology for GIL transmission, crossing the river through tunnels and avoiding the impact on the gold channel.
Two projects have contributed to a new leap in our electrical equipment manufacturing capability.
At present, the national grid has accumulated "10-to-11" super-voltage engineering, and 4-to-3's in progress.
Foreign Exchange Office: our external debt structure continues to be optimized.
" Overall, our external debt structure continues to be optimized and external debt stability enhanced ... "
The press spokesman for the National Foreign Exchange Administration, Wang Chun Ying, the chief economist, stated on 27th that the main indicators of our external debt were within the internationally recognized security line and that external debt risk was generally manageable.
Wang Chun Ying made this statement in response to a question from the press when the Foreign Exchange Bureau published external debt data for the end of June 2019.
The data show that, as of the end of June 2019, our external debt balance in full calibre (including this foreign currency) stood at US$ 1998 billion, an increase of US$ 26.3 billion, or 1.3 per cent, over the end of March 2019, mainly due to the increase in the balance of debt securities.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70 per cent of our full-calibre external debt was boosted by non-residents buying in-country renminbi bonds, mainly by medium- and long-term investors such as central banks.
At the end of June 2019, the share of medium- and long-term external debt rose by 3 percentage points compared to the end of March 2019 and the share of local currency external debt rose by 1 percentage point compared to the end of March 2019.
Wang Chun Ying stated that, with the inclusion of the renminbi bond in our country in April 2019 in the Pemberbaclay global composite index, international investors ' recognition of the Chinese bond market has increased further and the internal renminbi bond has been continuously increased.
" Our balance of payments remains generally balanced and external debt risks are manageable... "
The journalist learned from the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences on 27th that at present, night moths from Yunnan Grassland have been effectively protected from widespread outbreaks of disaster and control efforts have yielded phased results.
In January of this year, for the first time in the city of Jiangcheng County, Yunnan Pumang City, we discovered that night moths had been moved from abroad, and then confirmed in 129 counties in Yunnan, where night moths had spread from Yunnan to China, posing a direct threat to food production in China.
Grassland night moths are an important agricultural pest originating from the inter-American tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are a major migratory pest of the FAO Global Warning, characterized by "international, migratory, volatile, destructive".
The pest endangers more than 80 crops, such as maize, sugar cane, sorghum and so on, and takes large quantities of food, causing up to 70 per cent of the production loss.
It's very difficult to control it. There are no registered pesticides in China to control it.
Since the grass-grain night moths invaded Yunnan, the Yunnan Agricultural Academy of Sciences has selected Ae-dong Fellows to lead the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences ' cross-border harmful organisms, in collaboration with the Green Control and Control Department innovation team, to the first line, field investigations, sample collection and technical guidance and pilot demonstration.
The Aedong team has acquired initial stock characteristics of the night moths in the Yunnan Grasslands, the resources of the trichlorfon, the characteristics of the source of the off-shore worms, the trajectory of the migration of the stocks, the toxic effects of the drugs and the effects of field control.
They have actively engaged in research and application of green control technologies, and have achieved more than 90 per cent control in demonstration areas through stock monitoring, insect trapping, scientific medicine and the implementation of new green control technologies, such as agronomy measures, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting natural enemy resources and the ecological environment, and providing technical safeguards for the effective control of storm formation and sustainable governance of lawn night moths in Yunnan.
At present, night moths from the Yunnan meadows are effectively protected from widespread outbreaks and control efforts have produced phased results.
Next, the Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences will focus on ecological mechanisms for stock relocation and invasion, breaking through the biocontrol and green control technology systems.
At the same time, to actively promote cross-border international cooperation for the establishment of joint focus laboratories and joint monitoring points and demonstration areas outside the country to enhance the monitoring and early warning capabilities of all aspects of night moths in the Yunnan meadows.

White Paper: China ' s way out of a country-specific development path
On September 27, China News Agency Beijing released the White Paper "China and the World in the New Age" by the State Council of China Press Office.
The White Paper states that for 70 years, the Chinese people have made great efforts to explore and move forward and have successfully opened the path of socialism with Chinese identity and achieved world-renowned development achievements.
According to the White Paper, China's development depends on self-reliance and hard work.
China's development is based on the true spirit of "800 million shirts for a Boeing" and the constant struggle of generations and the hard work and sweat that others cannot imagine. It is on the spirit of "one's own shoulders" — whether good or bad — not to export problems, not to turn to conflict, not to sell hard, not to rob others of their own development. It is on the spirit of "touching through the river" — not to go through imperialism, colonialism, not to follow Western national development patterns, but to combine China with reality, to learn lessons, to learn from human civilization, to try and get out of one's own path.
The White Paper states that China has developed in its interaction with the world, that China ' s development has injected positive energy into world peace and development, and that China ' s roads are adapted to China ' s circumstances and to the requirements of the times.
China defends world peace through practical action.
For 70 years, China has not initiated any war or conflict and has not occupied an inch of the land of another country.
According to the White Paper, China ' s development has been a great success for 70 years, because of the fact that it has found the right path to development, with the socialism of China ' s identity, and is firmly on that path.
It is a path that is based on national circumstances, that places the interests of the people first, that is, innovation for change, that seeks common development in openness and that is fully governed by the rule of law.
China is huge, complex and difficult to govern, without unity of concentration and strong leadership, and will lead to division and disintegration, bringing disaster to the world.
The White Paper says that for 70 years, China has overcome risks and challenges and created another world-renowned Chinese miracle.
In particular, China has achieved historic achievements in its development since the 18th birthday of the Chinese Communist Party, with historic changes that have brought the Chinese nation closer to the great goal of national renewal than ever before.
This path of development in China will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward.

Taiwan scholars have argued that "The Unsure Ages" should be followed by mainstream industries on the continent.
"2019 Business Innovative Business Models Forum" was held in Taipei on 26, 27 days a day.
The event invited representatives of various trade unions and scholars to share experiences on business transformation, innovation, succession and market development.
The Forum was hosted by the Taipei Institute of Business Management and co-sponsored by organizations such as the Group of Goldman Sachs, the Distinguished Continental Alliance of Trade Unions.
The two-day meeting was divided into transformational upgrading models, business strategies, etc., and was organized in consecutive workshops with over 100 participants.
Chen Ming-hyun, President of the Institute of Management of Business in Taipei, said that the Chinese-American trade friction continued and Taiwan was faced with an "indeterminate age " .
In his view, traders needed to keep pace with the times and keep pace with the mainstream industries developing on the continent, with particular attention to innovative products related to science and technology, culture, tourism and health.
"In the past, clients valued quality, effectiveness and delivery... "
Chen Mingxing believes that the above conditions are not sufficient at this time.
He pointed out that portfolio firms needed to be both quick and service-driven, faster supply chains, and focused on extension and product-based services.
In addition, "service value added" is a new area where businesses can flourish.
The representative of Taiwan made a presentation, in which the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Taiwan Business Amnesia Electronics Company Ltd. from Guangdong introduced the fact that Amnesia Electronics had had operational difficulties as a result of a sharp decline in orders, and that the Consortium had moved from various directions to improve business, such as restructuring, living assets, etc.
It took three years for the company to take away the traditional electrical business, transform the car with electronic equipment and move into the intelligent power industry.
The General Manager of Solar God Electronics Co. Ltd., Shih Hong-hyun, suggested that if it was difficult to develop a new client, it would be better to focus on a one-stop service for the original client.
The replacement of suppliers by customers is not out of service, high prices, low quality, slow delivery, low variety, and integrity factors, all of which, together with the timely adaptation of production lines and the expansion of product lines, the enterprise will become an irreplaceable supplier to its customers.

New regulations for consultation: qualification of social capital for rural land ownership
Access of social capital to rural land ownership needs to be qualified
Public consultation on rural land transfer management options to regulate the transfer of social capital to land, such as business enterprises
Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development published a notice of public comment on " Management of Rural Land Administration Transfers (Advised Draft of the Revised Draft) " (hereinafter referred to as " the Draft Opinion " ), which increased the regulation and risk protection of the transfer of social capital to land rights, such as business enterprises.
The Draft Opinion is now open to public consultation.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, in order to implement the newly amended Rural Land Contracting Act, further consolidate and improve the basic rural business system, deepen the reform of the rural land system, implement the three-power separation system, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has revised the rural land contracting transfer management system, resulting in a "draft opinion " .
The Beijing Young News reporter learned that the first published version of the opinion was subject to a number of important changes.

Transfers of land contracting rights will be regulated by separate management options.
According to the Draft Opinion, in the context of the "three-power division", farmers are only investing in land for a limited period of time.
Theoretically, even in the event of liquidation, farmers are at risk of losing business rights only for a certain period of time, and therefore providing for the return of the contract to the original contractor is no longer legally necessary and in conflict with the "insolvency law".
In response to the issue of preventing the risk of land loss by farmers, priority shares, first lease and then buy back have emerged in practice.
Taking into account that priority shares have matured theoretical exploration of company law, it is recommended that they be used as advocacy provisions to protect against the risk of loss of earnings ...
