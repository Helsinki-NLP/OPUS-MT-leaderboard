According to the British media, the United States Vice-Minister of Naval Operations, General William Moran, said that even as the United States Navy was re-energizing its efforts to deal with increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, the United States continued to focus its efforts on the Asia-Pacific region – the Pentagon – extending the area to include Indian Ocean-Asia-Pacific.
According to the United Kingdom Defense Weekly website, on September 24, the United States listed Russia and China as strategic competitors in its new defence strategy announced at the beginning of the year.
Since then, the United States Navy has resumed its second fleet in order to confront Russia more directly.
According to the report, these moves raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts who feared that the United States Navy might be far from the Obama administration's Asia-Pacific Rebalancing strategy.
But Admiral Moran said that the focus of the United States Navy was still on the Western Pacific.
On 24 January 2018, at a round-table discussion entitled "Addressing the challenges of the high seas", hosted by the National Asian Research Office in Washington, D.C., he said: " For us, there has been no significant change... "
Milan said: " The point is still to rebalance, shift the focus or whatever you want to describe it... "
But he admitted that the United States was close to Europe.
He said, " We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do... "
Although Moran pointed out that the general policy regarding Russia fell within the purview of the United States Secretary of Defense, he warned that " Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has shown that if we clash with them, they will be very hard ... "
Admiral Moran said that, as part of the renewed United States campaign against Russia, China and other competitors, the United States Navy was dynamically deploying its forces into a " new mode of combat " , which would help to keep the opponent out of sight of where the United States carriers or other assets would be deployed at any given time or place.
He said, " We, the Navy and the Marines, support it -- the concept of unpredictability of combat, not to appear in the same place again and again, almost like a hair bar -- -- this is our approach ... "
It was reported that the first attempt at this new approach was the Harry Truman carrier combat group, whose early deployment included working visits to ports and patrolling areas normally only through.
Milan said that the United States Navy was currently working to ensure that allies knew that these vessels would continue to patrol the traditional areas and that logistical and family liaison issues were being addressed for the new deployment procedures.
Lieutenant General Michael Nunan, Commander of the Royal Australian Navy, also addressed the event, stating that the Australian Army could work seamlessly with American carriers.
He said that the situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy planned to procure nine additional frigates equipped with Zeus Shield.
Many airlines have raised or restored fuel surcharges since October 5.
Yesterday, airlines such as Hmong Air, Okai Air announced that from 5 October 2018 (the date of the ticketing), each passenger on the domestic route would be charged a 20-dollar fuel surcharge and each passenger on the more than 800-km surcharge.

Children, all wounded by the military/police; babies continue to be exempt.
According to the person in charge of the airline ticket, the airline had indicated in its notification that the fuel surcharge was collected on the date of the original ticket and that the fuel surcharge was not refunded in exchange for the ticket.
This means that no additional fuel charges are to be paid if the internal route tickets are to be changed until 5 October.
Since 5 June 2018, a number of airlines, such as State, East, Sea, Shanghai, Spring Fall, Shenzhen, West Air, Okai Air, have resumed charging fuel surcharges for three years of cancelled domestic routes at a standard rate of $10 per person.
On this occasion, O'Kay Air first announced an increase in fuel surcharges, and as soon as the press releases were received, no follow-up information was received from the four major air carriers in the country.
It is also understood that the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department provides that airlines will be free from November to decide whether to charge a fuel surcharge.
At the earliest, on 27 September, Air China announced that fuel surcharges would be recharged as of 2 November.

On Friday, Ito, Ito, Japan, recognized $1.3 billion in impairment losses on its investment in China's Chinese shares, and its largest business investment transaction was written off due to trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan, a man walked through the HQ.
Maroon says that the American grain sector, under the banner of the trade shock, has suspended its financial transactions in agriculture.
Some Japanese manufacturers of heavy equipment, telecommunications companies and others have previously warned about the impact of trade friction in China and the United States, and these Japanese traders have joined the ranks.
The United States and China imposed customs duties on each other ' s hundreds of billions of dollars of commodities, and US President Trump threatened to extend the tax to more than $500 billion of China ' s goods, if the dispute was not resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, Director of Commerce and Finance, Ito, said that next year the impact of trade disputes on the Chinese economy might be even greater.
Ito and the Thai Bee Group invested $10 billion in Nakshin in 2015 to gain 20 per cent of their equity.
Hachimura claims that Ito and Ito Merchant made a 143.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) increase in equity holdings in this sector, as the Chinese share price is not expected to rise again in the near future.
Ito's business plans for Ito's financial year ended 31 March 2019 are estimated at 500 billion yen.
In July, China imposed a 25 per cent import tariff on soybeans from the United States to counter China's trade friction initiative.
"Our grain business has been hit by a friction between US and Chinese trade," said Maru-Han-Han-Yan-Yan-Yan.

On November 5th, China-News posted a comprehensive report that the mid-term election poll in the United States is in its countdown.
On 4 November, President Trump and his Democratic rivals actively "led out votes " to their core voters.
Both parties point out that voter turnout will be the key to voting.
It is reported that in 48 hours before the polls in the United States, Trump was busy attending a Republican campaign, while former President Barack Obama went to Indiana to stand up for the impending Democratic Federal Senate candidate, Joe Donnelly, and shouted to the crowd for the final demands before the elections.
On 4 November, Trump went to Megang, Georgia, to stand for Republican governor candidate Brian Kemp, who said: " Tuesday you have to be at the polling station, you have to vote... "
"It's not possible to compare this election more clearly... "
The political enthusiasm of voters rose to a rare peak, and early voting in some states was far from normal.
The President of the United States faces the first mid-election, and the number of seats in the Congress of his party tends to decrease.
According to the Washington Post and a new poll published by the American Broadcasting Corporation News Network (ABC News) on 4th, while the Democratic Party's federal House of Representatives continues to have an advantage, Republicans can benefit from economic assessment and Trump's strict interest in border security.
According to the polls, registered voters prefer more candidates for the Democratic House of Representatives than Republicans, 50 per cent to 43 per cent, but there is still a decline from the 14 percentage points ahead of August.
Another poll by the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) and the Wall Street Journal also shows that Democrats are still ahead of the Republicans by 7 percentage points.
It is known that Obama, on the occasion of Senator Donnelly ' s campaign, said to the public: " When people don ' t tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, they will have bad consequences...
Democracy will not work when people can only lie to themselves. "
"The only way to put an end to these Republican behaviors now is through you and your vote... "
The Democratic Party faces the most difficult election in the Senate for decades, and the Republicans now hold more than half of the 51 seats.
But the House of Representatives is more favourable, and the Democrats need to win 23 more seats to take control of the House of Representatives with 435 seats.
According to the analysts of the projected election site FiveThirtyEight.com, the chances of Democrats winning the House of Representatives are as high as 85%.
Xi Jinping General Secretary Xi attended and spoke at an important theoretical seminar on strengthening and improving the work of the ACHD.

Wangyang noted that, since the eighteenth birthday of the Party, General Secretary Xi Jinping has proposed a new set of ideas for strengthening and improving the work of the ACHD, first of all that ACHD is an important channel and specialized consultative body for socialist consultative democracy, an important component of the system of State governance, the institutional arrangements with Chinese characteristics, the first elaboration of the characteristics and advantages of the new political party system, the emphasis on the correct handling of the relationship between coherence and diversity, and the fact that the true idea of popular democracy is a matter of negotiation, which has been discussed by the public and reveals the logical link between the Chinese administration and the Chinese political system, and the deep theoretical thinking on the development of a civil affairs agreement system for good people, which is the latest outcome of the Party's civil affairs co-op.
Wangyang stressed that the CCP at all levels should use theoretical learning as an opportunity to further identify weaknesses and shortcomings in its work and to work on strengthening and improving it in order to make a breakthrough.
The establishment of the PCPS should be strengthened in a comprehensive manner to ensure that the party ' s central decision-making is deployed to the PCP.

In the light of the current wave of popular entrepreneurship, innovation and innovation, the People's Network of Beijing on November 5, more and more technology companies began to focus on patent research and development and related protection efforts, digging deep into the potential value of patents and gaining market ownership.
Similarly, there are a number of technology enterprises that have experienced significant encroachments on patent technology licensing and the use of patented technology.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei Ho, from Guangdong Province, Mr. Reuben, the developer of the APP, Beijing Little Orange Technology Ltd. (hereinafter " Little Orange Technology " ), the operator drop-by technology Ltd. (hereinafter " drop-off " ), and the seller, Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Ltd. (hereinafter " Guangdong Pacific " ) v. Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court on the grounds of patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs sought the court ' s order that the three defendants immediately cease manufacturing, selling, promising to sell, using the plaintiff ' s patent.
On 30 October 2018, the Chinese Network of Judicial Instruments published the " Civil decision of first instance in a dispute over the patent infringement of inventions, such as Tan Wei, Ho Chang-hong and Beijing Little Orange Technology Ltd. " , revealing the details of some of the cases where APP had been sued for patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs argued that the patent owner and inventor of the patent based on mobile terminal carpooling systems and methods, and the entire operation of the APP application, which corresponds to the technical programme of patent protection, constituted a patent violation.
However, at the time of the Court's decision, Orange Technology held that the Guangdong Pacific was not a proper defendant, that it had only provided free downloads on the Internet in connection with the APP drop-off, that it had not applied the patent method in question, that there was no direct or indirect violation and that it should not be listed as a defendant in the present case.
Secondly, the violation in this case is not in Guangdong.
In accordance with the law, the tort of the patent in question should be the place where the patent method in question was carried out in its entirety, and therefore the jurisdiction of the court was challenged, requesting that the case be referred to the court of the defendant ' s domicile, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court found that the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, had supplied the alleged tort drop-off APP product on its web platform and that it was not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, as defendant.
And the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, resides in Guangzhou City and is under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant, Orange Technology Co., claimed to have referred the case to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for lack of substantiation, dismissed the defendant, Orange Technology Co. Ltd. ' s objection to the jurisdiction of the case and charged the costs of the jurisdiction challenge.
Other proceedings in the case have not been made public and journalists will follow up on the patent infringement.
Visit to the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research: significant results of cooperation in science and technology in Australia
" China ' s science and technology have developed rapidly over the past decades, and the two countries can achieve fruitful results by joining forces in the field of science ... "
Larry Marshall, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research, who was interviewed by a Chinese news agency journalist in Beijing, said that cooperation in the field of science and technology in Australia had been vibrant, ranging from climate change to SkyEye cooperation.
As the largest national scientific institution in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has produced many innovative research findings of world interest in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials, astronomy and so on.
CSIRO has been working closely with scientific institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"It's a long-standing friendship, a friendship that includes trust in partners and a long tradition of cooperation..."
In May of this year, China ' s 500-metre-gauge radio telescope, China SkyEye, installed the first international 19-beam L-band receiver.
The 19-beam feed receiver, currently the most advanced in the world, was developed jointly by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall indicated that the successful development of the receivers was based on the accumulation of CSIRO technology over the years and that the speed of the FAST cruise would increase by five to six times, while at the same time expanding the scientific observation targets.
"This is a contribution of CSIRO to FAST..."
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO is working closely with Chinese scientific institutions on the construction of a square kilometre array radio telescope, the development of new fuel technologies, energy efficiency reduction, etc.
"In the past, scientific research has tended to be about hundreds of years later, and more scientific research is needed to solve the problems that lie ahead... "
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a number of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather events are frequent throughout the world, droughts and floods have led to reduced food production and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, problems such as population explosion, ageing and chronic diseases are also serious challenges.
" The cooperation between the two countries in recent years has focused primarily on solving these immediate difficulties ... "
Marshall reported that the International Centre for the Study of the Southern Hemisphere, established by CSIRO in conjunction with the National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology of Qingdao, focused on observing the El Niño phenomenon and the La Niña phenomenon, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather events, and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather; and that the new varieties of cereals to overcome extreme weather, developed by CSIRO in conjunction with the China School of Science and Technology, could also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather events.
" In the current environment, where science, technology and innovation are very difficult to accomplish alone, very costly and very many issues to be addressed, cooperation is particularly important today ... "
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation, the more likely it would be to make breakthroughs, which would also mean that both sides would strengthen their cooperation within the "one way" framework.
" Enhancing bilateral cooperation, mainly in science and technology, for us ... "
For example, Marshall, CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide, because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, and many countries hope to find a method of pure gold that is less polluting to the environment.
"We're willing to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the results of our engagement in the "One Way" cooperation. "
On 29th, in Xinjiang, in Urumqi City, the Pony Silk Road Tourism Promotion and Project Collaboration, participants were able to enjoy local foods and the rich historical culture of the region while appreciating the development of the Pony.

At the same time, Xinjiang's travel agencies signed an agreement on tourism cooperation with the Bocai River tourist area, the Farmen Temple Buddhist cultural site, the Tai White Hill tourist area and the Guanshan Savannah site.
" The Great Xinjiang, where some tourism resources are complementary to the Chicken, we have travelled all the way to Xinjiang to introduce it, mainly human chickens, delicious chickens, natural winds, and more than 500 photographs to allow customers to feel the beauty of the chicken... "
The event focused on tourism resources, tourism projects, tourism routes, etc., through tourism promotion films, promotion of cultural tourism resources and projects, tourism photography exhibitions, production of promotional brochures, distribution of promotional materials, exchange of tourism cooperation, promotion of a comprehensive picture of the chicken tourism industry as a whole, high-quality tourism products and excellent tourism industry projects, consolidation of the Xinjiang guest market, overall singing "Look at the Chinese chicken" brand, raising the visibility and visibility of the town in the northwest, and attracting more Xinjiang tourists to the Xinjiang chicken tourism experience.
The Deputy Director-General of the Pony Markets Bureau, Feng Xu, said: " This event, the various departments of Pony City at all levels, the districts, the development districts, actively engaged in contacts and coordinated the implementation of a large number of good projects, big projects.
To date, 41 signed projects have been implemented, involving a total of 26.43 billion yuan ... "
In recent years, the chickens have been built around the goal of building internationalized cities along the "One Way" initiative, equipping manufacturing cities, historical and cultural names, and beautiful and happy cities with suitable settlements, continuously upgrading industrial clusters, logistics hubs, integrated services, open highlands, human cohesion, and accelerating the pursuit of beyond and high-quality development.
In 2017, the region ' s GDP reached 218 billion yuan, an increase of 8.7 per cent.
More than 20 national prizes were awarded to civilized cities throughout the country, the National Ecoforestry City and the China Habitat Environment Award.
Urumqi City Council Standing Committee, Deputy Mayor Yin Naemin, introduced Urumqi as a major town on the Silk Road in New North Province, with a special geographical advantage, since ancient times as a link between Tianshan and North, between Xinjiang and the Mainland, between China and Central Asia, West Asia and Europe, and an important window for China ' s opening to the West and the exchange of its economic culture with the outside world, with a good investment climate.

Can we re-energize the old industrial base, release it, and hold the general secretary's heart.
The Foreign Minister of the DPRK, Lee Yong Ho, stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued imposition of sanctions is deepening North Korea ' s mistrust of the United States and that North Korea cannot unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
In the United Nations General Assembly, Lee Yong Ho said that the DPRK had adopted a " very friendly approach " over the past year, including the cessation of missile and nuclear tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and a commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
" But we did not see any corresponding response from the United States " , he said.
"If we don't trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security. In such circumstances, we cannot give up weapons unilaterally... "
Although Lee Yong Ho repeats North Korea's complaint about the United States' opposition to "phased" denuclearization, his statement is of great significance, because there is no total rejection of unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea did in the past.
Lee Yong Ho referred to Kim Jong-un and Trump's 12 June joint statement when Kim Jong-un agreed to work towards "denuclearizing the Korean peninsula" and Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
The Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea has been seeking a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has stated that it must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The U.S. also refused to relax its demand for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on `denuclearization first ' and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve their objectives in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to issue the `Declaration on the End of War ' , " Lee Yong-ho's name.
"The idea that sanctions can make us beg for forgiveness is that those who don't know us are dreaming.
But the problem is that these continuing sanctions are deepening our mistrust ... "
Lee Yong-ho didn't mention the second Special Council plan mentioned by the President of the United States earlier this week.
On the contrary, he highlighted the three meetings between Kim Jong-un and Korean President Ying during the past five months and said: " If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea and not North Korea, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not become so deadlocked ... "
China announced a reduction in import duties for 1585 tax purposes as of 1 November 2018.
Since this year, China has taken successive initiatives to reduce import tariffs.
On 1 May of this year, there was a general tax reduction on medicines, with tariff adjustments to zero for all generic drugs, including anti-cancer drugs, and for bio-alkali drugs with anti-cancer effects, and for a total of 28 tax items, such as actual imports of intermediate medicines.
At the same time, there has been a significant reduction in the production of anti-cancer medicines, the import chain VAT tax.
Taxes on cars and spare parts for 218 tax purposes on 1 July.
After the tax reduction, China ' s car-to-car rate is below the average in developing countries and is in line with the real situation in the Chinese automobile industry.
This tax reduction will drive industrial restructuring and optimal resource allocation, accelerate success and underachievement, improve the quality of products and services, and are expected to boost vehicle price adjustment to some extent and increase consumer benefits.
On July 1st, 1449 tax purposes were taxed on consumer goods on a daily basis.
Taxes on consumer goods are linked to people's needs for a better life.
This tax reduction is not only large but also substantial, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
Taxes on consumer goods used daily directly benefit consumers and promote competitiveness in domestic industries.
On 1 November, a tax reduction will be imposed on 1585 items of industrial equipment, including spare parts and raw materials, for tax purposes.
Appropriately reducing tariffs on imports of some of the much-needed industrial products in the country can attract more foreign investment, facilitate more efficient domestic supply and enable industrial upgrading, while helping enterprises to allocate resources globally and reduce production costs, as well as reduce domestic environmental burdens.
The head of the Office of the Customs and Excise Committee of the State Council of China reported that the four above-mentioned autonomous tax reductions, as well as the third step of the tax reduction introduced on 1 July this year as a result of the negotiations on the extension of the scope of the information technology agreement, would reduce China ' s total tariff level from 9.8 per cent in the previous year to 7.5 per cent.
The overall level of adjusted tariffs is slightly higher than that of the EU and lower than that of most developing countries, is at a medium level and is largely compatible with China ' s developing country status and stage of development.
The Officer-in-Charge explained that the overall level of tariffs, as one of the key indicators of China ' s openness in the area of trade in goods, should be adapted to the stage of China ' s economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China ' s trade in goods is the first global basis for further expansion of the open economy, but the quality and efficiency of trade development are not yet equal to that of developed economies, and therefore the overall level of tariffs should be properly reduced.
Tariffs are a means of protection for compliance. Tariff levels should be commensurate with industrial competitiveness, good competition should be encouraged, excessive protection would be detrimental to industrial development and quality improvement.
Tariff rate adjustments need to be balanced between production needs and consumption needs.
Focusing on reducing high levels of domestic demand, contributing to escalating commodity tariffs for industrial transformation, working to increase imports of niche products with more concentrated population needs, increasing business and public access and meeting the need for upgrading industrial and consumption structures.
Tax cuts need to balance fiscal revenues with the affordability of industrial development.
The choice of specific tax cuts in commodities and in the range of tax cuts should be made in a way that integrates both domestic and foreign markets, both upstream and downstream, in terms of production and consumption, and preserves the momentum of China ' s stable economy.
The Officer-in-Charge stressed that this year marks the fortieth anniversary of the reform and opening up, and that China has taken the initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs in accordance with the major steps required by China to achieve high-quality development on its own, in order to facilitate the integrated use of both international and foreign resources, to promote the qualitative improvement of the domestic supply system and to meet the needs of the population in terms of rising consumption.
These actions and initiatives demonstrate China ' s firm commitment to a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy, its firm support for economic globalization, its firm adherence to the principles of free trade and the multilateral trading system, with the WTO as its core, and its continued efforts to draw momentum from openness to the world and to make China ' s development more beneficial to the world.
The President of Serbia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo.
According to information from the Office of the President of Serbia, the President of Serbia, Vucić, ordered the country ' s armed forces to enter maximum operational readiness in view of the occupation by the Kosovo Special Forces of access to the Belgrade-controlled water reservoir at the Gazivoda hydroelectric power station in northern Kosovo.
On 29 September, the Minister of Defence of Serbia, Wu Lin, declared that the Serbian army was in full operational readiness.
The Mu Lin stresses that Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as the order issued by Vucic remains in force and that the RSLF will respond in whatever direction the situation may take.
According to the Russian Tas organization, on 29 September, Vucic stated in an interview that he had already briefed the parties, including the United States and Russia, on the current situation and would travel to Moscow on 2 October to meet with Russian President Putin to seek Putin ' s support on Kosovo.
When asked whether Serbia needed Russian military support like Syria, Vucic replied in the negative: " I do not want a major military conflict on our territory ... "
Vučić also stated that the full operational readiness of the RSLA was only intended to create a deterrent to prevent the conflict, but it was also a clear warning that no violence would be tolerated in Kosovo.
The increase in the operational readiness of the RSLA is related to two major Kosovo initiatives.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days, Albanians have been massing arrests in the northern part of Kosovo of Serbs who have lived there for generations and who have not violated any law.
Vucić claims that since the beating and detention of Marko Jurich, head of the office of the Serbian Government in Kosovo and Metohija, on 26 March this year, the Albanian community has escalated the situation in the region, carrying out inhuman arrests and deportations of Serbs.
In addition, the previously self-proclaimed ROSU Special Forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, more than 100 persons, including armed police and snipers, occupied positions near the water reservoir at the Gazivoda hydroelectric power station, entered the ecological and sports centre near the dam in the northern part of Kosovo and blocked all nearby roads, which were otherwise controlled by the Serbian side.
Vucić pointed out that this military adventure in Kosovo was instigated by Western countries and that the Kosovo Army had acted without prior notification to the Serbian side, in violation of chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, as well as Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and the military-technical agreement between Serbia and Serbia.
Vucic has already spoken to NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, criticizing the hypocrisy of Western countries with regard to Kosovo.
The root cause of the current conflict is still the centuries-old historical feud between the Serb and Albanian communities in Kosovo.
There is a difference between Serb and Albanian affiliations in Kosovo.
Serbia regards Kosovo as a national cradle and a cultural cradle, as Serbia established its most powerful State here in the 12th century, while Albanians moved in in in large numbers only after the Ottoman Empire invasion and the defeat of the army.
The Albanians, for their part, insisted that the original Ilya tribe, which lived in Kosovo in the fourth and fifth centuries B.C., was the ancestors of the Albanians and that Kosovo had therefore been Albanian territory since time immemorial.
Subjective political divisions have led to violent clashes between different ethnic groups, religions and cultures, which have led to fierce confrontations between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo.
In 1912, Kosovo Albanians first declared Albania ' s independence.
After the First World War, a large number of ethnic Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, with a relative increase in the Serb population, which, in the view of the Serbs, "only take back their land" but was looted by ethnic Albanians as "Great Serbiaism" and fuelled bi-communal tensions.
Kosovo became the " powder bucket " of the Balkans.
In 1999, an armed conflict between the Albanian separatists of the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro by NATO troops and the outbreak of the war in Kosovo.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its secession from Serbia ...
Since then, despite the news that Serbia will normalize its relations with Kosovo and sign global and legally binding agreements, agreements held hostage to various forces, such as the United States and the Russian Federation, have not been concluded due to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints.
And just a month ago, Vucic made clear for the first time that he advocated the separation of Serbs from Albanians in Kosovo and the re-opening of conflicts between the two communities.
Electricity is still out of order.
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency early in the morning of 30, a strong earthquake and tsunami in Dungara district, Central Sulawesi Province, in the country, resulted in 420 deaths.
According to Wilem Rampangilei, head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, this figure is only a preliminary estimate of the city of Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi, about 80 km from the earthquake, which has not yet been rescued due to the lack of large search and rescue machines, many of the hotels destroyed by the earthquake, the mall, warehouses, etc.
On 29 September 2018 local time, a bridge damaged by an earthquake and tsunami collapsed and broke down in several sections in Bar Road, Indonesia.
As a result of the severe damage to electricity and communications facilities, the earthquake in Dungara district and the adjacent Sigi region remain unconnected " silos " , unable to count the number of victims.
In this press report, Vice President Kara of Indonesia reported the death toll or thousands of people.
Power cuts, communications disruptions, road disruptions, airport damage... and rescue efforts after the earthquake and tsunami are very difficult.
As a result of power cuts, some hospitals and rescue sites in the city of Palu are dependent on fuel for electricity generation.
Roads into and out of the city were blocked by landslides, and large transport vehicles, including tankers, were denied access, placing a strain on fuel supply.
According to the Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs, Agus, as a result of road damage, the Ministry has not arrived in the disaster-affected areas with emergency relief supplies such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothing, food, household kits, etc., from the provinces of South Sulawesi and Columbus adjacent to the earthquake zone.
The relief materials transferred from the capital, Jakarta, are being transported to the affected areas via air transport aircraft.
In view of the damage caused to the command tower and runway at Palu airport during the earthquake, all commercial flights for the purpose of securing safety and rescue have been suspended and only military aircraft transporting relief supplies and personnel have been withdrawn.
In Indonesian politics, where relief is directed in the earthquake zone, the Minister for Legal and Security Coordination, Viranto, called for the prompt resumption of electricity supply and airport commercial flight services to ensure the functioning of relief agencies such as hospitals, more rescue workers and volunteers, and the arrival of aid supplies in the affected areas.
In Indonesia, a series of strong earthquakes in Dungara district, Central Sulawesi province, caused by a tsunami caused by a 7.07-scale earthquake at 1702 hours local time, caused a major disaster in Palu, Dungara and Sigi districts.
In the recent days, Beijing has continued to open the most beautiful blue sky pattern, bringing thousands of people of the city to the social platform, to shine happiness in the screen, and to call it "The Blue Sky Cloud, the 'Drunk' beautiful Skyline, which is the best card in Beijing."
Since August, Beijing has welcomed the Blueest Sky.
Within the city, people can be seen anywhere, either with a smart phone or with a single back camera.
On social platforms such as microblogging, microblogging circles, the palaces, Tiananmen, nests, alleys, and all kinds of buildings display different beauty under the blue sky.
Some netizens say that such a big picture is the best in Beijing; others say that if such a blue sky brushes, people with cervical vertebrae can be cured; and even more so, they hope that "the blue can catch the spring and summer and make the sky blue for all the seasons of the city."
Why does the people of the city love the sun?
Only because the people who lived in this city in the past suffered from the fog, so eager for the blue sky, and after the " blue sky defense battle " in Beijing, which continued to improve the quality of air, the fog became less, the blue sky grew, and the people looked to their hearts and the happiness they had gained was an extraordinary measure.
On the Fourth of July, the weather was clear in Beijing.
At 8 a.m., the vast majority of the 35 air quality monitoring stations across the city were shown to be green.
The "Blueest Sky" thematic photography contest on social networking platforms is still going on.
Why is the sky so blue in Beijing these days?
According to the Officer-in-Charge of the Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, the average concentration of fine particles (PM2.5) in Beijing in August of this year was 35 ug/m3, the best ever recorded for the same period in almost five years.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 in September is more of a current number.
A major factor in the emergence of the "Blueest Sky" is the overall favourable weather conditions in recent times, and, more importantly, the sustained management of atmospheric pollution in Beijing, the intensive promotion of clean air action plans over the past five years, and the continued release of environmental benefits, which have led to a reduction in the total discharge of pollutants in the region, all of which provide the basis for a sustained improvement in air quality.
Beijing officially launched and implemented the Beijing Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017 in 2013.
According to the plan, official efforts to defecate non-capital functions and promote energy clean-up and pollution reduction have been continued, with a total of 4923 coal-fired boilers phased out.
Beijing became the first big city in China and China to have a full net gasification.
Data show that between 2013 and 2017, the average annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased by 35.6 per cent; air quality increased by 50 days; first-best days increased by 25 days; heavy pollution days decreased by 35 days and the incidence of heavy contamination decreased significantly.
In parallel with the continuous improvement in air quality, the Beijing official released in September of this year the Beijing three-year action plan to win the Blue Sky Defence War, based on a new round of PM2.5 sources, focusing on the current governance phase and pollution characteristics, focusing on key areas of control such as diesel trucks, rising dust, volatile organic matter management, optimizing transport structures, industrial structures, energy structures and land use structures, strengthening regional alliances, focusing on intensive urban management, promoting green development across the board, and trying to get the Blueest sky to stay in the city and make things less precious, returning them to the background and not to be the main players in the history of the world.
During the Golden Week this year, the relevant departments, such as the City Tourism Board, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Municipal Administration, Public Security and others, will intensify their law enforcement checks on the "one day" market, focus on the "six black" phenomenon of tourism, and, once found guilty of violating the law, will be punished from the top to the bottom of the law.
Yesterday morning, the city's government held a special event on illegal "one day" and deployed a special operation to further "one day" illegal "one day".
At the conference, it was revealed that the focus black ticket, black guide, black agency, black car, black shop, black net interest chain were interwoven and that the city had launched a campaign against illegal one-day trips since July 28.
Since the launch of the campaign, 39 complaints of "one day" have been processed across the city, a decrease of 63 per cent; since this year, 270 complaints of "one day" have been processed across the city, a decrease of 62 per cent.
Over the past two months, the city has seized 248 black cars, seized 158 traffic violations, closed 29 shopping "black shops" and performance venues, seized 13 "black clubs", 27 black guides, confiscated 26,000 illegal advertisements, removed 31 illegal "one day" billboards, 3 bus stop signs, investigated 1789 offences involving various travels, opened 181 cases with various functions, fined 4.48 million and detained 111 persons involved in offences.
As a result of the clean-up, the illegal "one-day" chaos was largely contained, and the "one-day" market order was stable and good.
According to reports, in recent years the city has been increasing its efforts to deal with illegal "one day" trips.
In 2016 and 2017, the MTC received 1612 and 897 complaints, 79 and 44 per cent less, respectively, but the illegal "one day" continued to be repeated, often rebounding, and formed a black ticket, a black market, a black car, a black market, a black web, and the like.
Specifically, illegal street lobbyists are "black fares " , illegal websites that publish false tourism information are " black nets " , travel agencies engaged in illegal "one-day" trips or institutions or individuals without the qualifications of travel agencies are " black houses " , "black guides " , and "black guides without a tour certificate or in violation of the law, who use non-tourage passenger vehicles or "black cars " , which provide passenger transport services for illegal " one-day " trips, and eventually they bring tourists into designated tourist shopping shops, "black shops " .
During this special campaign, the city has continued to increase regular inspections and mobile patrols of illegal "one-day" trips, targeting illegal "one-day" travel routes with high frequency and high impact. The authorities have carried out daily unannounced visits in their cars, and have found evidence of violations of the law, and have been subject to strict scrutiny in accordance with the law.
Among them, the black car and the black shop became the focus of two hard fights.
It was described that without a black car, an illegal one-day trip would not have taken place, and that a black car would have been easy to detect, remember and search, and would have been a fixed asset of higher individual value.
The authorities use road traffic surveillance cameras to increase the supervision of the main one-day tour bus, and use technical, physical and other technological and intellectual means to detect the black car in time.
Tourism shopping "black shop" is also a top priority because of its small number.
In order to strengthen the deterrent and combat against illegal "one day" trips, any special operation found to be in violation of the law is punishable by heavy penalties.
In August of this year, the city also held a seminar on the legal aspects of illegal "one-day tour" to examine the means of combining administrative penalties with convictions.
The City Tourism Board has indicated that more regular travel agencies will be encouraged to undertake a "one day tour" in Beijing in the future, increasing the supply of regular "one day" to further crowd out the illegal "one day" living space, and that specific programmes are still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Council has continued to refine the e-Tourist Travelway Information System to ensure that each team is included in the regulation of the e-Trip Platform.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economic symbol, what has U-town been through all these years?
As the permanent venue of the World Internet Congress, the city of U.U. has received a lot of attention.
Five years after the first World Internet Congress, the city has changed.
In 2014, there were only 12 Internet-related businesses across town and the digital economy, and by the third quarter of this year there were more than 500.
It's a microcosm of U-town's digital economy.
The Internet Congress allowed local firms to accept the digital economy at zero distance, inspired by a digital wave, a strong desire for business transformation and upgrading, and increased investment and research and development by traditional manufacturing firms in machine-changers, smart management, etc.
The secretary of the U Township Party, Kang Jian, said that U Town would build a new economic empowerment centre in the future.
The digital economy is growing in isolation from the support of infrastructure.
This year, U-town launched the 5G pilot on the basis of the full coverage of the 4G communications network and free WiFi.
At the same time, the city of Kirang, where the town is located, has become a hot ground for the development of the Internet industry as the first county city in the country to build a dedicated access to international Internet data.
Since the first World Internet Congress, 565 digital economy projects have been introduced, with a total planned investment of $37,725 million, bringing the total value of the core manufacturing sector of the digital economy to $8.73 billion in the first three quarters of the year, representing an increase of 13 per cent in the value added.
"Until then, the town was a tourist symbol, followed by theatre and cultural symbols... because of the Internet Congress, it is now the Internet and digital economy symbol... "
In the view of the Secretary of the Quino City Council, the dividends of the World Internet Congress have accumulated over time, and therefore there is a greater need to build a platform to absorb talent, projects, technology and so on.
Shen Yee from the village worked outside for 20 years and went back home to start a business because of her association with the Internet conference.
On 2 December last year, he entered the fourth Internet light fair with high-capacity anti-digital modification technology solutions and was favoured by a number of clients.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in Wu Town not only because of her home country ties, but " In Utown, it's easier to attract people than I thought, and our applications are fast-tracked, and we have our applications in the U-jin Smart Parking Project... "
A U.S. Avenue shows the spillover effect of the Internet General Assembly.
This road across the north and the south side of the city is not only a tourist attraction, it's an industrial road.
With it, the U.S.V.C. was created in response to the rally.
Journalists learned that in the future, Utsun Boulevard will be the leading position in the development of the village ' s industrial sector, leading to a great deal of intelligent medicine, wise old age, wise government, and a gathering of industries and a large number of high-level talent, which account for 80 per cent of the city ' s GDP.
The tsunami caused by the earthquake in Indonesia has killed at least 410 people.
According to the Director of Public Information of the Indonesian police in Jakarta on the evening of 29, the current earthquake in Central Sulawesi has killed 410 people, 97 of whom have been identified.
Another 29 people are missing and 540 injured.
Palu airport is still closed.
Active treatment, with 98 per cent of premature child survival in China for 29 weeks or more, has reached the level of developed countries.
The National Children's Medical Center (NCMC) announced on September 30 in China and New China on the Internet that it introduced Canada's advanced methods in the title "China NiCU Prenatal Quality Improvement Project" at the University's Paediatric Hospital on September 30th.
The results of the project show that China has 98 per cent of premature births of children aged 29 weeks or more and has reached the level of developed countries, but there is still much room for improvement in early delivery of children at a very young age without complications.
For almost 20 years, the Chinese government has been focusing on the treatment of newborn babies.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has fallen to 3.71 per thousand, significantly below the national average and at advanced levels in developed countries.
The China NIOC Postnatal Quality Improvement Project, which has been working tirelessly for four years, has significantly improved the quality of life of pre-born children.
Professor Cao Yun, Director of the Neonatal Stress Care Unit (NICU) at the University Hospital, University of Maktan, said to journalists that, while increasing the survival rate of pre-natal children, attention was being paid to reducing the quality of premature child survival, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the pre-neurological development and the overall end-of-life of children, which was important for improving the overall survival and demographic quality of pre-natal children, a major concern for both the national and international paediatric communities, as well as the neonatal community, and a key concern of the project.
The China NIOC Early Birth Quality Improvement Project, which has worked tirelessly for four years to include tens of thousands of premature births of 33 weeks of age and under, has led to a one-third reduction in the country's infant mortality rate at birth and early birth weight, as well as a significant reduction in the incidence of serious complications in premature births and a significant improvement in the quality of the survival of pre-born children.
The project has introduced the concept of collaborative quality improvement through the establishment of a nationwide network of collaborations for the improvement of the quality of newborns, radiation exposure to 25 collaborative hospitals throughout China, a set of collaborative efforts to improve pre-natal care, improve the integrity of neonatal care, systems and effective methods of collaborative quality improvement, adapted to the national context.
In the context of the project ' s accumulated experience, the University-affiliated Paediatric Hospital is working with the National Newborn Unit to develop guidelines for the treatment and treatment of neonatal infections and to provide reference and guidance for the regular treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is known that in China's Prenatal Quality Improvement Project, the Paediatric Hospital introduced the EPIQ methodology to 25 large NIOCs in 19 provinces of the country, working to address the problem of pre-natal infections in China's neonatal care units.
After more than a decade of continuous improvement, the survival rate of premature births in Canada has increased by about a third, and Canada is now one of the best countries in the world.
The EPIQ methodology is now applied to all NCUs throughout Canada and has been adopted by six countries.
According to the paediatric hospital, two years after EPIQ intervention, pre-natal infections fell by 35%, while antibiotics use fell by 20%.
In the future, this approach will continue to be replicated and implemented throughout the country by the General Paediatric Hospital, affiliated to the University, with a view to reducing the overall incidence of all complications in premature births and improving the quality of care for newborns throughout the country.
At the moment, there is an indisputable fact that there are differences and inequalities in the level of treatment in different parts of China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important unit of the National Centre for Children ' s Medicine, paediatric hospitals will play a radiation-guiding role. This study will cover several western provinces, including Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu and Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting the homogenization and regularization of neonatal care throughout the country.
It is understood that the hospital attached to the University of rehabilitation is working with the National Newborn Unit to develop guidelines for the treatment and treatment of neonatal infections based on the project ' s accumulated experience and to provide reference and guidance for the regular treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It has been revealed that in 2019, the focal point, the China Neonatal Collaboration Network, located at the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Gangdan, will join 63 hospitals throughout the country to undertake the next phase of national quality improvement with a view to promoting the equitable development of the level of care for newborns in China.
The Director of the Shanghai Health Planning Commission expressed alarm that Shanghai could become a central city in the Asian centre, not only in research, but also in the construction of the entire service system, and that the quality of services and the results of services should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting China ' s level of health care.
Episode: "Hero Monument" -- written on the Fifth Martyrs' Day.
On 30 September, on the eve of the birth of the Republic ' s 69th birthday, we celebrated the fifth Martyrs ' Day, where the Xi Equality Party and the National Leader came to Tiananmen Square to attend a flower basket ceremony for the heroes of the people.
At this moment, no matter where you are, please salute the British.
It's a day of re-temperation, and it's a wake-up call.
Open up the big history. Behind every martyr's name is a living life.
They also have hot youth, true love, family.
However, because of their conviction that "the doctrine of our faith is the truth of the universe " , they will sacrifice everything they have in order to " spare the suffering of the next generation " .
"I'm going to cry for China for one day of my life."
Through time and space, the British rise a spiritual sign and guide the way forward.
"Where to go, where to go " , " what to be " , read hard enough to come up with answers...
In memory of the hero, the most important thing is to build a "hero monument" in my heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the Revolutionary War, some 20 million martyrs have lost their lives to national independence, the liberation of their people and the country ' s rich and powerful.
For a variety of reasons, many vanguards didn't even leave their names.
Countless men pour blood on the ideals, live to practice their faith, remember their name, and pass their spirits on to the roots and spirits of the nation.
This "hero monument" is unblemished and unscathed.
For some time now, there has been a gloom of historical nihilism, general entertainment and so forth.
The distortions of history, the demeaning practices, the challenges to a just conscience, the miscalculation of value judgements, and the public outrage and alarm of society as a whole.
The hero must not forget.
We cannot afford to be allowed to touch the bottom line, but we must be bold enough to show the sword and defend our dignity with justice in accordance with the rule of law.
On May 1, this year, the Hero Martyrs Protection Act came into force.
In judicial practice, the verdicts in some cases have been very encouraging, both in the effective defence of the bright image of the United Kingdom and in the release of heroism and respect for the positive power of the vanguard, in accordance with the law.
A nation that pursues it cannot have a hero, a country that aspires to it cannot have a pioneer.
The memory of the vanguard, the call for heroes, has become a universal social consensus.
At present, there are millions of memorial facilities throughout the country, and more than 100 million visits to Martyrs' Mahals every year.
The heart is the strongest building block.
Let the hero, defend the hero, learn the hero, take care of the hero, put the spirit into the bloodline of the nation, and a "hero monument" shall stand between the heavens and the earth, deep in the hearts.
Reuters, 28 September - Following Italy ' s surprise with its massive budget deficit plan, in defiance of the EU, the EU took a non-confrontational stance against Italy on Friday, but it might take a more radical stance if Italy insisted on too ambitious a goal.
The Italian skeptical government’s target of a budget deficit of 2.4% of GDP over the next three years suggests that there is still no reduction in debt in the face of demand for a reduction.
On Friday, the ECEC Executive Committee on Economic Affairs, Moscovisi, stated that " we have no interest in the crisis between the EC and Italy " and that " he has taken a cautious response as EU recommendations and sanctions may have little impact on Italy " .
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will convince Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy formally submits it to the EC in mid-October.
After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in almost two weeks on Friday and the Italian bond rate of return reached its highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains the same until the October deadline, the EC Executive Committee may veto Italy ' s draft budget, something the EC has never done to any country.
At a meeting later on Friday in Riga, the EU Executive Committee Vice-President stated that Italy ' s current financial plan " appeared to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Pact " , referring to the EU financial regulations.
But he didn't say it would trigger a reaction from the EU.
The bidder may submit an application for participation in this open tender by 26 October of this year.
The Russian Ministry of Agriculture used China as one of Russia's priority markets for agricultural exports.
In May, the Russian Agricultural Supervisory Authority announced that for the first time in the agricultural year, Russian food exports to China exceeded 1 million tons, an innovation record.
The Bureau predicts that China may be among the top 10 Russian food importers.
On September 30th, Sapporo, the Chinese Communist Party, after winning the Cuban team at 3:0 in the first battle, won the Turkish team at 3:0 again on September 30th, winning two series of tournaments in the 2018 World Cup.
But Chinese women are more dangerous than the first battle.
Twenty-four teams participated in the 2018 Women's World Series, with Chinese women in groups B, Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
From the world ranking and overall strength of Team B, the Turkish and Italian teams are the main rivals of the Chinese team.
As soon as the game began, the Chinese team took the lead, maintained the advantage, put a lot of pressure on the opponent to take the first round at 25:18.
In the second round, the Turkish team, which was in a tough position, took the lead at 6:2; the Chinese team, after requesting a suspension, adjusted its formation and gradually pursued the score to 7 even, followed by a number of blockbacks and a score of 7:0; the Turkish team, at the end of the bureau, was at 15:19; the Chinese team, at 24:20, followed by two points by a recalcitrant Turkish team; and the Chinese team, once again, asked for a pause, to win the second round with Jo Ting's running to take the second round at 25:23.
In the third, the situation is very tenuous, and the two sides are up against each other, at one point at 19 flat.
At a critical moment, the Turkish team failed, with the Chinese team taking the lead at 21:19 and the Chinese team winning the game at 24:21 with Ju Ting's heavy button and Chang Changning's attack; then the Turkish team will be on the score until 23:24, the Chinese team will be calling for a suspension, the Chinese team will win at 25:23, and the Chinese team will win.
After Pingsai, China's female coach, the whole game wasn't easy.
"We're better prepared, we're better off, the Turkish team is more comprehensive, and we have to mitigate our mistakes and try to win through our own initiative... "
Jo Ting, who worked for the Turkish Wakiv Bank team in the face of a familiar team, was subject to a lot of restrictions in the first round of the game the same day, and she continued her aggressive campaign after her own initiative to change.
"We know each other well and it's normal to be watched, but the Chinese team is extremely active, blocking the net and attacking it in a bad way... "
Next, the Chinese women's platoon will take a day of truce for physical and technical training; on October 2, the third opponent will be the Canadian team.
On the 30th of September of the 30th, Hebei's High School of Water held a ceremony to focus its projects on the second half of 2018.
On that day, six projects were concentrated, with a total investment of $4.29 billion.

Experts from the national field observation and exchange of research activities in the cotton-free country entered the test field to hear a briefing by a representative of the Chinese Engineering Institute team of Shikishishi.
Xinjiang Shaya, Xinjiang Xinjiang, on September 30th, is located at the Xinjiang Shanya County test site for the production of non-membrane cotton, which is "no less color" than the next membrane cotton, and a white cotton contest is "open" with its branches.
From 27 to 28 September, a national on-site observation and seminar exchange on cotton-free cotton was held in Xinjiang Shaya district.
During the tour, journalists learned that the cotton-free technology system, dominated by the Khmer 619 and its accompanying cultivation measures, had initially achieved the goal of cotton field defilmization, reduced the contamination of the ecological environment and raw cotton by the Xinjiang cotton film and made significant progress in the research and demonstration of the cotton-free cotton complex.
Member of the Chinese Institute of Engineering, renowned cotton genetic breeder, and Chief Scientist of the National System of Modern Agricultural Technology, Shiki Shiki Shiki, gave a presentation to the Secretary of the Zhejiang College of Agriculture and Forestry Party, N. Zhou, on the development of the membrane cotton.
" The combination of membrane-free cotton technologies that we have developed can fully achieve non-dural cotton cultivation and can solve the problem of magnesium contamination and achieve green cotton planting ... "
The Chinese Academy of Engineering's Shijiki's introduction.
Xinjiang is China ' s most important cotton-producing region. According to the National Statistical Office, Xinjiang ' s cotton cultivation in 2017 was 35 million acres, representing 61 per cent of the country ' s cotton area.
Since the introduction of the membrane into China in 1982, Xinjiang has had more than 50 million acres of crop cover and approximately 300,000 tons of membrane use annually.
Of these, cotton membrane coverage reached 100%, and cotton cover accounts for about 60% of the use of the Xinjiang membrane.
Cotton production is measured without membrane, and it can produce 320 to 350 kg.
As the amount of Xinjiang membrane inputs increases, residual membrane recovery rates are low, the amount of film residues in the soil is increasing, and a range of problems, such as the structural destruction of the soil caused by the membrane, seriously affect sustainable agricultural development.
Fragmentation not only causes serious contamination of the soil, but also has a significant impact on the quality of cotton fibres.
At present, more than a third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang are mechanized.
In 2017, the Xinjiang machine picked about 14 million acres of cotton.
In machine cotton harvesting, large amounts of surfaces are generated, shredded membrane on cotton strains, magnesium mixed in original cotton is difficult to remove during the original cotton processing process, and also during subsequent textile processing, which severely affects the quality of textile products.
On 28 September, a national field observation and seminar exchange was held in Xinjiang Shaya County.
In an effort to address cotton-field land contamination, streamline cotton-planting techniques and improve cotton-field efficiency, Aki led his team through eight years to implement "Medium 619" cotton-free technology cultivation to give a wing to Xinjiang's green agricultural development " .
It's a quick introduction to a new idea of seeding that breeds very early, salt-resistant, low-temperature, high-yielding cotton on the land, 619 " .
" `Medium 619' has achieved a series of accompanying measures, such as a mechanical set-up of non-film seeding in the southern part of Xinjiang, improved depth of seeding, shallow densification of drip tubes under non-membrane conditions, suitable for density screening, reasonable chemical regulation ... "
Currently, demonstration sites for membrane-free cotton have been set up in Aksu, Kurle, Alar, etc., with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare.
Cotton growing without membrane, yielding high yields, savings, environmental protection, combined efficiency gains.
Xinjiang Production Corps, 3rd Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinjiang Farmer, said that through almost six years of technological research and demonstration in the field of membrane-free cotton cultivation, the production of membrane seed cotton could be fully achieved by 320 to 350 kg, possibly even higher.
" There are great prospects for the diffusion of cotton-free technology... "
Zhang Jianhai believes that current cotton-free technology can solve the problem of soil filtration contamination once and for all, but there is still a gap between the economic benefits of the present and the cultivation of the membrane.
" Support for cotton purchase prices will be conducive to future promotion ... "
He and his team will continue to conduct in-depth studies and wide-scale extension of the membrane cotton industry as the next step, as well as to address the soil contamination caused by the membrane.
Guangdong Land, Air and Sea actively responded to the Golden Week shipment - China New Network
September 29th is the seventh day of official traffic in Hong Kong, High Steel. It's the first weekend after the opening. The head of the West Kowloon Station has been saved.
The Golden Week of the National Day (1-7 October) is due to begin on a daily basis and journalists have learned from the relevant sectors that the various transport sectors, such as the Guangdong Railway, aviation, water transport and roads, are actively planning for increased mobility and safeguards are put in place to ensure safe and orderly movement of passengers within the territory during the Golden Week.
According to China Railways Guangzhou Group Limited (hereinafter referred to as " the Guangqiang Group " ), during the Golden Week this year, Guangqiang is expected to transport 17.8 million passengers, an increase of 155,000 by 9.2 per cent over the same year.
In order to meet passenger travel requirements, the Guangti Group plans to open 104 additional train trains, 85 additional train trains, mainly on hot lines such as Kinguang, Kuo-kun, Hong Kong, Hong Kong and Hong Kong.
Shi Yun Airport in Guangzhou will be the busiest airport in the interior during the Golden Week of the National Day, with more than 1.4 million passengers expected to be transported and more than 9,200 landing flights flown.
With the increasing number of international routes, the airport is expected to see a significant increase in international passengers compared to the past, which will be a significant feature of the Golden Week holiday this year.
It is known that Singapore, Bangkok, Phuket, Jakarta, Colombo, Maldives, Manila, etc., are the hot cities where this year's President of the Nation is travelling on holiday, Kathmandu, Kuala Lumpur, and other tourist hot spots like Bali continue to explode, and some of the flights "can't get a ticket."
In particular, some airlines have increased the number of operating classes, such as: Shenzhen Air, with one new class of Guangzhou-Hane flight per day; Iran Mahan Air, with one class of Guangzhou-Tehran flight per Saturday; Viet Nam, with four, with one class each.
In order to secure the holidays, White Cloud Airport has increased the security of priority posts such as "space allocation " " " baggage security " " " duty service " " " passenger security " , and has prepared flights for large delays in their disposal.
According to China South Airlines, this year's Golden Week goes to AUSIN and the routes to North America and Japan and Korea are very hot, while flights to China, China, Chengdu, Shanzhou, Kyawshan, Kamakshan and other tourist destinations in China and China are also relatively tight.
South China Plan's Golden Week will add 50 flights, including 10 flights to and from Chiang Mai in Guangzhou.
According to the Guangdong Maritime Authority, prior to the festival, serious security-related operations were carried out against key ships such as the cruise ship, the passenger ferry in the Strait of Jonglei, the high-speed passenger ship at the Pearl River Cross, the ferry crossing, etc., to ensure a stable safety of water traffic during long holidays.
During Golden Week, traffic in Guangdong Province is expected to be at the top of China's list.
The Guangdong Transport Group recently issued a holiday highway guide, which is expected to increase by about 12 per cent.
The General Directorate of Market Supervision has recently issued a circular on strengthening the regulation of market prices during the Mid-Autumn Day of 2018, which calls for the strengthening of price controls in the area of rental housing and real estate, the tightening of rental price collusion, the hoarding of rental sources, the fabrication of false information to raise rents, the misalignment of fees in the form of tied services, the publication of misleading price information, and price violations such as price tags.
The circular makes it clear that price monitoring alerts should be strengthened and market price dynamics closely monitored.
Greater price monitoring and early warning analysis should be followed by close attention at all locations, including for essential necessities such as the consumption of high-volume-consumption meat and egg milk salt, as well as changes in markets and prices of special commodities consumed by the local population during festivals.
Once market volatility tends to be detected, and the problem becomes acute, timely measures are taken to address it effectively.
Increased monitoring and inspection of the wholesale and retail distribution of essential necessities of life, increased frequency and regulation of sites closely linked to the daily consumption of the population, such as the agro-trade market, and compliance by operators with the law and good faith.
The circular stated that the focus area should be strengthened to create a favourable consumer environment; that the regulation of the price of State-owned market tickets should be strengthened; that the State-owned landscape should focus on violations such as non-compliance with government-mandated price levels or fluctuations, the imposition of additional charges, the increase in the price of tickets through irregularities in the form of tickets such as "campaigns", high price discounts, tied sales, non-compliance with prescribed specifications, the non-implementation of preferential measures, price additions, compulsory surcharges, etc.
The notification requirement is to strengthen the regulation of prices of essential goods, especially agricultural products.
Owing to seasonal changes, natural disasters and outbreaks, recent fluctuations in the prices of essential agricultural products such as vegetables and pork have occurred in some areas.
Locally, market price regulation for agricultural by-products needs to be strengthened in line with local realities, in line with the efforts of relevant sectors to stabilize production and market supply, and in order to organize market focus checks and random spot checks.
Increased frequency of inspections of commodities such as fast-priced pig meat, serious checks of hoarding, price lifting, collusive price increases, etc.
The circular states that price regulation in the area of housing rental and real estate should be strengthened.
In mid-Autumn, during the season of rental of housing and sale of goods, it was important to pay close attention to the price behaviour of real estate enterprises, intermediaries and housing rental-related enterprises, to severely correct rental price collusion, to hoard rental sources, to fabricate false information to raise rents, to collect fees in the form of tied services, to publish misleading price information, price violations such as price tags for unknown codes, to increase the scrutiny of price bids for hot-distribution plates and real estate intermediaries, to check consumer interests such as failure to comply with the requirement to impose a "one mark", to disrupt market order, to cleanse the real estate market environment and to create an open and transparent real estate market price order.
The circular refers to the need to ensure that prices are regulated in other parts of the tourism industry, with emphasis on catering, accommodation, shopping, sightseeing, recreation, parking, etc., and to direct operators to ensure that prices are clearly priced, that fees are publicized, and that all types of price violations are seriously investigated.
The circular states that the inspection of transport prices, such as roads, railways, civil aviation, water transport, etc., should be intensified, and that violations such as price increases, extra-price charges and non-compliance with prescribed specifications should be seriously investigated.
Implement a policy of free minibus tolls on the "Green Channel" and major holidays for the transportation of live agricultural products.
Innovative regulatory tools and working methods, increased dissemination of price laws and regulations for off-line retail businesses and e-commerce platforms, improved price promotion programmes for operators, legal checks of false original prices, misleading price indications, non-compliance with price commitments, etc.
The journalist was informed on 1st day that the 15th anniversary of the 15th anniversary of the direct traffic of the Hong Kong train has been marked by three speed lifts, and thus far the passenger traffic has been increasing; the cumulative total number of passengers travelling to and from the port has reached 1.7 million.
At the same time, Hong Kong and Macao passengers will not be released for more than 15 seconds.
On 1 October 2003, the State Council approved the establishment of a temporary crossing point for the direct traffic train between Shanghai and Kowloon, the first long-distance rail passenger crossing to Hong Kong within China, marking the opening of the port in Shanghai, where water is already available, air traffic, and land-based "three-wing" flights.
To date, the Hong Kong train has been running directly for 15 years.
The Shanghai Railway border inspection, which was tasked with the border check of the port of entry and exit, revealed that since the beginning of the operation, the train has been moving three times at speed, from almost 30 hours to 19 hours, with an average annual traffic of incoming and outgoing passengers having increased from less than 80,000 to more than 150,000; over the past 15 years, the total number of passengers travelling to and from the port of Hong Kong has broken 1.7 million.
Over the past 15 years, Shanghai Railway border checkpoints have signed a police coordination mechanism with points along the Nine Trains, and police officers have been assigned to escort control, providing full coverage of 1991 km of services and controls.
Over the past 15 years, the Shanghai Railway Border Post has detected almost 1,000 cases of violations of the law and successfully solved cases of illegal entry of foreigners with false permits and the use of someone else ' s identity as a substitute for departures.
The station has also established mechanisms such as working exchanges with the Joint Inspection Unit, conducted regular training exercises for the Integrated Counter-Terrorism Branch at railway ports, combined with the construction of a third-level guard belt for the railway crossings.
Over the past 15 years, it has been known that the Shanghai Railway Border Department has continued to provide innovative services and has increased the speed of customs clearance.
The border checkpoint has also formed a volunteer service group called "Tyran" to provide loving help to the elderly, pregnant women and passengers with babies.
On 30 March, the press learned from the Ministry of Finance that the Ministry of Finance, the National Tax Administration, the National Development Reform Commission and the four departments of the Ministry of Commerce had recently issued a joint circular to further encourage foreign investors to invest in China, to distribute profits to offshore investors from enterprises resident in China, to suspend the application of the policy of pre-taxation for direct domestic investment, and to expand projects such as foreign investment incentives to all projects and areas not prohibited from foreign investment.
This policy has been in effect since 1 January 2018.
The circular makes it clear that direct investment by offshore investors with a profit share includes enrichment by offshore investors with a profit share, equity investment practices such as new construction, equity acquisition, but does not include additions to eligible strategic investments, transfers, acquisitions of shares in listed companies.
If an offshore investor is required to enjoy the policy of withholding advance income tax but is not actually entitled to it, he may apply to recover the policy within three years of the date of the actual payment of the relevant tax and refund the tax paid.
Moreover, foreign investors who, after enjoying the prescribed policy of withholding the advance income tax, are subject to special restructuring conditions and are actually taxed in accordance with the special regime may continue to benefit from the policy of withholding the advance income tax.
In order to ensure that profits derived from offshore investors are actually used for direct investment, the circular provides that profits from direct investment by offshore investors are paid in cash, that the relevant funds are transferred directly from the account of the profit distribution enterprise to the account of the invested enterprise or the transferring party, and that the profits from direct investment by offshore investors are paid in kind and in non-cash form, such as securities, and that the ownership of the assets is transferred directly from the profit distribution enterprise to the invested enterprise or the transferring of equity, and that no other enterprise is held or held on behalf of an individual prior to direct investment.
The circular also calls for enhanced follow-up by the tax authorities in accordance with the law.
Expatriate investors who have enjoyed a policy of withholding advance income tax are deemed to have failed to pay corporate income tax in accordance with the requirements, except for corporate liability for profit distribution, as verified by the follow-up management of the tax authorities, and will be liable under the law for delays in tax collection, which will be calculated from the date of payment of the relevant profit.

Yesterday afternoon, the Beijing Holdings Football Club (hereinafter referred to as North) responded officially to allegations of false football by the team ' s former foreign aider Anachebé that the North Control had issued a statement stating that there was absolutely no false play on the part of the club, and that this was a complete fabrication made by Anachebé himself in the course of the arbitration process, in order to cover up the fact that he was in flagrant violation of the contract, and for his personal illegitimate economic purposes.
At the same time, the North Control states that it will reserve the right to use all means to hold the person concerned accountable ...
According to the British Daily Post, Nigerian player Anachebe accused FIFA of being suspected of playing a fake ball by the Beijing North Control team he had served last year, including Beijing Derby in the 21st round of the 2017 season.
It was a crucial stage for Beijing and for Beijing, and the game of North Control ended with a zero-to-two hit on Beijingers and the first launch of Anitcheby.
There was an official response from the North Control Club yesterday to this Nigerian player's story.
According to the statement, after an internal investigation prior to the club, there was no false play in the game in which the team participated.
Ani Chebe joined Beijing North in June 2017 and, in December of the same year, Ani Chebe refused to join the team for winter training without any justification and refused to do so despite numerous reminders from the club.
At present, the dispute between the parties has been referred to FIFA and arbitration is ongoing.
The statement also referred to the fact that the "false ball charge" of concern was in fact a lie made by Anachebé in the course of the arbitration to cover up the fact that he was in flagrant violation of the contractual agreement and for his personal illegitimate economic purposes.
The only purpose of his defamation club and his defamation of Chinese football is to gain illegitimate economic benefits.
Clubs are less open to any organization or any individual who, for the sake of their economic interests and their private interests, makes false accusations, slanders, slanders and slanders against clubs.
Therefore, the North Control side indicated that it would reserve the right to use all means to hold the parties concerned accountable ...
The Bank of Agriculture Development of China will invest 20 billion yuan to support the Quilin Autumn Food Purchases.
Since September, crop harvests have peaked in various parts of Jilin Province.
Journalists have learned from the China Agricultural Development Bank ' s Jilin provincial branch that farmers are now issuing $20 billion in credit funds to ensure that the financing of the Jilin Autumn food acquisition is sufficient.
It is understood that the food production situation in Jilin was generally stable this year, with some food processing enterprises increasing their capacity, starting up rates and increasing demand for food markets.
In order to ensure the availability of funds for food policy acquisition, agricultural distributions have been actively engaged in the Autumn Food Acquisitions Monetary Corporation (FAS) interface through visits to various acquisition entities such as farmers, processing enterprises, trading enterprises, etc.
At present, agricultural distribution has invested $5.2 billion in support of the purchase of 1.58 billion pounds of autumn grain by various food buyers.
One hundred and twenty major food buyers are located in nearly 300 acquisition sites in Jilin province, ensuring full coverage of the main food-producing districts, without leaving the acquisition funds at the "blank " point " .
Heads of relevant agricultural distribution indicated that, in accordance with the pace of acquisition and the demand for money from businesses, and in the event of a shortage of funds for acquisition, agricultural distribution would apply for an additional $20 billion in credit funds to ensure the timely and full availability of funds, maintain stability in the food market and protect the interests of farmers.
Chinese journalists will be taken away by the police in the year of the British Conservative Party. China asks for an apology.
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, the spokesman for the Embassy in the United Kingdom answered the question of a Chinese journalist who had been taken away by the police during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party.
The speaker stated that we asked the Conservative Human Rights Committee to stop interfering in China ' s internal affairs, to stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and to ask the organizers of the conference to apologize to Chinese journalists.
A question was asked: on 30 September, during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party, the party ' s Human Rights Committee held a side event on Hong Kong and invited the Hong Kong opposition to speak.
A Chinese journalist was taken by the police during the event.
Do you have any comments?
In response, he said that in the 21 years since Hong Kong returned to its homeland, the practice of "one country, two systems" had been a great success, and Hong Kong's development achievements had been universally recognized.
Hong Kong is Hong Kong, China, and Hong Kong is a purely domestic matter.
The Human Rights Commission of the Conservative Party uses the party ' s annual conference to organize side events to raise awareness of the anti-China separatist forces, and China expresses its grave concern and strong dissatisfaction.
We are firmly opposed to any organization interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any way.
Any attempt to promote "Hong Kong independence" is futile.
The speaker stated that it was totally unacceptable for the United Kingdom, which had always been a champion of freedom of expression, to be prevented from expressing its views, even physically, when Chinese journalists questioned at the side event.
We demand that the Conservative Human Rights Committee stop interfering in China ' s internal affairs, stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, and that the organizers apologize to Chinese journalists.

The new US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain the ability of US President Trump to implement the 25 per cent tariff threat on imported cars, while at the same time providing for a general exemption from customs duties on passenger vehicles, pickups and car parts imported from Canada and Mexico, according to the trade agreement affiliation announced on Monday.
If Trump imposes so-called "Chapter 232" tariffs on cars for reasons of national security, Mexico and Canada will have a vehicle quota of 2.6 million exempt vehicles per year exported to the United States.
Under the subsidiary arrangements, the pickups produced in both countries will be fully exempt from customs duties.
If Trumpuga collects a car tariff, Mexico will receive an annual tax exemption of $108 billion for car parts and Canada will receive a $32.4 billion quota.
Both quotas are well above the current levels of production in both countries and provide room for growth in exports from both countries.
Reuters/Mexico 28 September - Mexico Friday states that after several days of controversy, the Government of US President Trump and Canada are making practical efforts to resolve trade policy differences, giving the outside world hope that NAFTA will maintain the tripartite form of agreement.
Despite the lack of detail, the obvious progress described above is sufficient to prompt the Governments of Mexico and the United States to suddenly stop publishing the texts of their trade agreements and to give Canada more time to accede to them.
Mexican President-designate Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador told journalists in Mexico that the United States Government had made new counter-proposals to the Canadian Government and that he would continue to press for the participation of all three countries in NAFTA.
The Minister of Economy of Mexico, Ildefonso Guajardo, stated that the submission of the text of the US-Memorian trade agreement to Mexican and United States legislation had been delayed because of the "very serious" attempt by the Governments of Canada and the United States to reach an agreement.
Guaharto said, " In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a text of a tripartite agreement or whether we have to publish the text of the agreement between the two parties ... "
Guahardo said that his American and Canadian counterparts had "specially requested" to delay the release of the text.
The spokesperson for the United States Trade Representative Office (USTR) did not comment on the text of the US-Mork Trade Agreement and the US-Canada consultations.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada have not responded to requests for comments on counter-proposals.
According to the outside media, in a care centre in the suburbs of Pretoria, South Africa, two small lions play together, and it's hard to see anything unusual, but they're nothing.
The University of Pretoria declared: " This is the first lion ever born by artificial insemination - the first pair of lions in the world... "
School scientists are working on the reproductive system of the female African lion.
The head of the mammal institute of the University of Pretoria, Gans Winter, said that the two young lions, one female and one male, born on 25 August, were healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive testing, his team finally reached this breakthrough.
In a media interview, Gans Winter said: " We gather sperm from a healthy lion... "
Next, the researcher has artificially insemination when the hormone content in the lion's female is appropriate.
Gans Winter said: " Fortunately, the results were successful... "
He said, "Researchers have tried several times, but unexpectedly, they haven't spent too much effort."
He said that the breakthroughs in the previous study could be re-tested and that scientists wanted to use the technology to save the endangered large cat species.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), lions are extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of wild lions remaining has fallen sharply by 43% in the last 20 years, leaving only about 20,000.
African lions are classified by this group as vulnerable animals.
Gans Winter says, " If we don't do something for these animals, they'll face extinction... "
He said that the new technology did not need to be raised by lions, but simply injected sperm into pregnant lions, as North America and Europe had done with elephant breeding.
Korea ' s exports declined the most in September in more than two years, but analysts attributed the decline to fewer days of work and stated that global demand for Korean commodities remained strong despite rising trade tensions in Central America.
Indeed, South Korea's average exports increased last month.
In addition, earlier published primary data show double-digit growth in exports in the first weeks of September prior to extended leave.
Korea ' s exports in September fell by the largest in the same year since July 2016 by more than 5.7 per cent, estimated by 11 analysts of the Reuters survey.
The opening value announced on Monday showed exports of $50.6 billion in September, down from $51.2 billion in August.
Despite fears that the ever-increasing US-China trade dispute might cause other export-dependent Chinese neighbours to suffer, South Korea ' s exports to China grew 7.8% in September, expanding for the 23rd consecutive month.
Korea's exports to the United States fell by 11.8 per cent, due to a decline in sales of petroleum products.
Korean memory chip and petroleum product overseas sales grew by 28.3 per cent and 13.5 per cent, respectively, despite market concerns that the so-called "supercycle" of the chip might be over.
" However, the impact of the trade conflict will be inevitable, as South Korea ' s exports depend heavily on the United States and Chinese markets ... "
Imports fell by 2.1 per cent to $40.8 billion, less than the 3.1 per cent increase projected by the Reuters survey.
The trade surplus in September started at $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
According to the Department of Industry, the global manufacturing industry will remain strong thanks to the United States and EU countries, which is a favourable factor for Korean exports.
The statement states that " higher export prices resulting from higher oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of this year ... "
" However, the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with increased market volatility following the rise in interest rates in the United States, are all negative pressures on exports ... "
Exports increased from an average of $2.6 billion per working day in September to $2.1 billion in August.
Korea's Mid-Autumn Festival fell from 24-26 September this year, so there were only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than in the same period last year.
Korea exports in January-September grew 4.7 per cent over the same period last year.
According to the Japanese/Market purchasing manager index, manufacturing activity in Korea recovered in September, but was supported by domestic orders because orders from China and Japan fell, which threatened to cloud export prospects.
North Korean media criticized the US for not relaxing sanctions against the DPRK.
North Korea's "Labour News" published an op-ed article in September 30, criticizing the United States for not relaxing its sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea while seeking dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
According to the article, the United States Secretary of State, Pompeio, "4th day said that "the key to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is the implementation of the sanctions against the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea " and stressed that the position of the United States to continue to comply with United Nations sanctions resolutions remains unchanged.
In Singapore ' s joint statement to the United States of America, the two sides committed themselves to a new inter-Korean-American relationship commensurate with the aspirations of the two peoples to peace and prosperity.
There is no doubt that it is contradictory for the United States to increase the pressure on the sanctions and call for dialogue.
The article states that if a new inter-Korean relationship is to be established, a permanently consolidated peace regime is to be built on the Korean peninsula and a complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is to be achieved, confidence should be built first, starting with what can be done, and a phased solution should be achieved on a case-by-case basis.
The article also states that the United States should understand that sanctions are not going to work for North Korea.
According to the article, even the North Devinsk before the Kazan would make the US Army proud.
The magazine "National Interest" quotes the American Navy: "We're going to meet a powerful potential opponent... and just look at the North Devonsk. "
The current commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in Europe, Fogo, also praised the North Devinsk.
He said: " This submarine is impressive... seeing how the Russian Navy is developing, how resources are used will know that its main efforts in research and development are, first and foremost, the reinforcement of the submarine fleet ... "
But the magazine National Interest still believes that the United States has an advantage over Russia in this area.
Forgo said: " I believe that Western countries still have asymmetric advantages ... "
There have been reports that the Russian Navy will be loading the Kazan submarine in 2019.
Kazan, New Siberia, Krasnoyarsk, the Arhangelsk multi-purpose submarines are all "White Wax Tree-M" modified, draining 13,800 tons, deep depth 520 metres, staffing 64 people, underwater speed 31 knots, will carry torpedoes, torpedoes and calibres, and cruise missiles called "Zamanau".
On 29 September, the General Directorate of Radio, Radio and Television launched a special radio and television advertising campaign, which began immediately until the end of the year.
The reform consists of low-quality, high-profile and low-grade advertising, and medical feeding programmes that are broadcast without a record management.
According to the circular, the focus of this special treatment is on nine areas of identification and consolidation.
These include: advertisements with low-profile content; advertisements with low-quality style, tone and quality; advertisements with excessive time and non-prescription; medical, pharmaceutical, medical devices, health-care foods, cosmetics, cosmetics, etc., which have unrecorded problems; medical feeding programmes with exaggerated false publicity, misleading the audience, inducing the audience to engage in bargaining, investing in money, collecting goods, etc., with expected returns on investment; advertisements that induce minors to engage in undesirable behaviour or develop undesirable values that harm the physical and mental health of minors; advertisements with public service announcements that are long and often do not meet the requirements; poor advertising management systems, which examine the lack of compliance and accountability; and advertisements with other irregularities.
This process will be carried out throughout the country, with the full implementation of the requirements for correction and regulation in the mass media at all levels, the frequency of channels, programmes and time slots, " No blind areas, no dead spots, no exceptions " .
The circular requires that all levels of the public education administration deal with the various types of illegal advertising found during monitoring inspections, in strict accordance with the General Directorate's Code of Conduct for Radio and Television Broadcasting.
In cases of serious non-compliance, statements are given, criticisms are communicated, advertising is suspended until such serious cases as frequency channels are suspended, and public exposure is made to society, as appropriate.
In recent years, the General Directorate of Wide Power has repeatedly called for the closure of illegal advertising.
This year, the National Radio and Television Directorate issued a circular calling for the closure of advertisements for serious violations such as the "O-Foot Milk" "Sava Cocktail" and "Bonrett Plant Prophylaxis" and exaggeration.
The General Directorate of Radio and Telecommunications has developed a number of regulations and circulars regulating the broadcasting of advertisements on radio and television.
The "Notification for the Further Enhancement of the Administration of Advertisements for Television Video Channels" stipulates that the Vigils are not allowed to broadcast short television commercials between 18 and 24 p.m. per day.
Advertisements on television shopping spots are broadcast at other times without the use of moderators, exaggerates, tone, movement, etc., or "orthopaedics " , " plastics " , " fats " , " fats " or "fats " campaigns or mutants, and diet products, with no more than one commercial (twice) per hour per day for television shopping, and no more than three minutes per day.
"Notification to further strengthen the broadcasting of radio and television advertisements" stipulates that television stations must comply strictly with General Directorate Order No. 61 when advertising in the middle of a video opera: two commercial advertisements may be inserted in each episode of non-gold time (45 minutes) for a duration of not more than 1 minute and 30 seconds each; one commercial advertisement may be inserted in each concentration of gold time (1900-2100) for a period of not more than 1 minute; when advertising is inserted, a reminder should be given to the advertising period.
The circular also stipulates that radio and television broadcasters must strictly examine the qualifications of health information advertisements, such as medical treatments, medicines, medical devices, health-care foods, and other legal materials, and firmly prohibit the broadcasting of sex-related advertisements.
In order to regulate the advertising of health information, no disguised advertising in health information features is permitted.
Health information features should focus on scientific knowledge, such as disease prevention, control and treatment, and should not contain advertising, such as information on medicine, medicines, medical devices, health-care foods, certification in the name of patients and doctors, pharmacists, specialists, etc.
Mantourov said: " For the first time, we have adapted the format of the MAKS International Aerospace Sharon. ... We recommend China as a main guest. ... China ' s peers agreed and accepted our invitation... "
Recently, Chinese President Xi Jinping invited Russian President Putin to the Fourth Eastern Economic Forum.
It's his first time at the forum.
Disregard the American threat!
EU may enter into a crude oil procurement agreement with Iran
The U.S. Government recently announced that a new round of sanctions against Iran would be relaunched in November and even urged other countries to reduce their imports of Iranian oil.
But America's allies don't seem to listen.
According to the United States New York Times, on 29 September, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif, when interviewed, revealed that Tehran was approaching the European Union to reach an agreement on the sale of crude oil, despite the United States threat to sanction any country doing business with Iran.
The central purpose of this agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, namely, to replace dollar transactions by barter or currency denominated.
The purpose of this approach is to bypass the United States and prevent it from blocking financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is committed to the promotion of the agreement, some French and British officials are concerned that, if the agreement were to be realized, it would be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States against the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement.
According to the American media, Zarif's words sound more optimistic in an hour's interview than in recent months.
Because the agreement has the ability to strip away America's traditional allies and effectively break US attempts to cut Iranian revenues.
" This ensures that we sell and benefit from oil " , Zarif believes that, according to the agreement reached in 2015, States have a legitimate right to trade with Iran ...
The EU Foreign Policy Officer Federica Mogherini also stated before that " no sovereign State or organization can accept anyone else to decide who to trade with ... " .
However, she also predicted that, pending the next sanctions imposed by the United States Government in November, United States leaders might resort to a range of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and countries with businesses in Tehran.
In May this year, the United States Government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement on the grounds that the agreement was flawed and stated that it could not permanently prohibit Iran from producing nuclear fuel ...
The United States then threatened to ban companies buying Iranian oil and other commodities from operating in the United States.
This threat caused some companies to evacuate Tehran and the Iranian currency to collapse.
Airbus and French oil giant Dadal have already cancelled billions of dollars in Iraqi investment.
British and French officials have said that the U.S. government might "take the upper hand " .
If not, according to a recent report in the Turkish media, the sanctions imposed by the United States do not seem to have had a significant impact on Iran ' s oil exports.
Iran's oil minister Xangane recently revealed that no country other than South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani believe that the U.S. actions are aimed at "sducing" Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif was also concerned about a series of verbal attacks by the United States, and when asked whether the United States would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing fiscal pressure, Zarif even laughed, " It is a strategy of regime change, which is the real purpose of the United States ... "

With a view to further encouraging offshore investors to invest in China, the Chinese Ministry of Finance and other ministries have jointly informed that, as of 1 January 2018, profits distributed by offshore investors from residential enterprises in China have been used to withhold the application of the policy of pre-tax income tax for direct domestic investment, and that foreign investment incentives have been extended to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and areas.
The Ministry of Finance ' s website contains relevant circulars stating that foreign investors are required to meet several conditions at the same time, including direct investment by offshore investors for profit-sharing purposes, including capital replenishment by offshore investors for profit-sharing, new construction, equity acquisition, etc., but not including additions, transfers, acquisitions of shares in listed companies (except eligible strategic investments).

Journalists have learned from the National Board of Health that the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in the country has decreased compared to decades ago, while the incidence of overweight obesity has increased significantly.
In this regard, experts pointed out that the most important idea of maintaining healthy weight is to " cure disease " , to promote scientific fitness and reasonable diet.
According to the Chinese Youth Health Education Core Information and Interpretation (2018 edition) published recently by the National Health Care Board, the key to maintaining healthy weight is reasonable diet and scientific movement.
Overweight, obesity and blind weight loss are not good for health.
The health risks behind Fatty can't be ignored.
The Director of the Nutrition and Health Unit of China ' s Center for Disease Prevention and Control stated that overweight obesity is harmful to the normal growth and development of young people and adversely affects their mental, behavioural, cognitive and intellectual capacities, and may even lead to high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood resin.
At the same time, overweight obesity among adolescents is likely to continue into adulthood, increasing the risk of high blood pressure and chronic diseases such as diabetes in adulthood.
According to Jing Jian Gang, the nutritional and health status tests conducted by Chinese residents in 2010-2012 showed that the rate of overweight among children aged 6-17 was 9.6 per cent, while the rate of obesity was 6.4 per cent, which was 16 per cent.
At the same time, overweight obesity among young children is more prevalent among boys than among girls, in urban than rural areas, and the rate of overweight obesity has increased significantly in recent decades.
How do adolescents cope with overweight obesity?
The Deputy Director of the Centre for Scientific Gymnasium and Health Promotion Research of the National Directorate of Sports, Zhang, noted that the main causes of obesity among young people are over-ingestion of heat and insufficient physical activity.
For this simple obesity, the focus should be on scientific motion plus rational dietary control.
According to Zhang Zhang, the most important concept of maintaining healthy weight is that of " curing the disease " , which is an important part of which is to provide schools, parents and students with comprehensive general education, to spread the dangers of overweight and obesity, and to raise awareness among adolescents.
Young people should undergo regular medical examinations, monitor growth and development indicators such as body weight, and early detection and scientific determination of overweight and obesity for timely intervention.
For young people who are overweight, Bing Gang recommends that, in addition to the active scientific organization of meals and sports, adolescents should be at a special physiological stage and should avoid the use of hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and reduce their weight and should not blindly take diet drugs.
Reuters September 28 - Friday, Facebook (FB.O.) stated that hackers stole digital landing codes, giving them access to nearly 50 million user accounts, which were unprecedented and the most serious security breach in their history.
Facebook monthly users over 2.2 billion, claiming that the attackers had not yet been determined whether any accounts had been misused or personal information had been stolen.
Nor did the company find the location of the hacker, nor was it certain that the hacker was targeting a particular victim.
Their preliminary analysis shows that it was a massive attack.
Executive Director Zuckerberg called this incident "very serious" at a media conference.
A spokesperson for the company said his account number and the account number of the operator Sheryl Sandberg had also been affected.
Facebook share price drops by 2.6% on Friday, dragging down Wall Street's main share finger.
The U.S. Congressman said on Friday that the attack might increase the public's call for data privacy legislation.
This is yet another sad evidence of the need for Congress to act to protect the privacy and security of social media users, as stated by Democratic Senator Mark Warner in a statement.
Rohit Chopra, a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), tweeted that I would like an answer to Reuters's coverage of this security breach.
On September 30th, China's fifth martyr's anniversary.
On such a special day, the families of war veterans, members of the Democratic Revolucionary Party, representatives of the Hunan House of Veterans, and other members of society came to the " Tang Man's Worm of War Resistance Park " in Changsha City to attend a mass funeral ceremony in 2018 in memory of the Martyrs' Day Veterans of War, to send 10 other veterans of the war and four partners of the resistance.
"The veterans of the resistance are witnesses to the Chinese resistance and are true, vivid, vivid teaching materials... "
Liu Xiao, former Vice-President of the Political Consultative Council of Hunan Province, said that the veterans of the war were courageous and forgotten my patriotism as a valuable spiritual asset to the present generation.
In his address, the Vice-President of the Changsha Municipal Association and the Chu Jianjun, Chairman of the Changsha City Council, noted that in recent years, the Care for War Veterans project has become an excellent brand in the work of the Changsa civil war social services, in the form of a living allowance, free old-age pensions, free burials, etc.
He believes that the spirit of resistance can only be carried forward if history is engraved in his heart.
At 11 a.m., in a solemn and heavy music voice, the people who came to the event stood up.
The members of the Tang troupe are dressed in tuxedos, with flowers, with neat paces, to send 10 other war veterans and 4 other war veterans together in a venerable formation.
The people who took part in the event offered flowers to the veterans of the war, and there were many children in the crowd who, along with their parents, paid tribute to the heroes of the war.
"The Tang Man's Hall of War Resistance" was the first mausoleum in the country to be built in 2014 with the theme of fighting, created by the Guinness Changsha City Council and the Hunan Tang People's Hall of Mansions Ltd.
The first phase of the mausoleum, which covers over 2,000 square metres, consists of components such as "The Hero's Immortal Monument" "The Victory Square" and "The War hero's mausoleum".
The "House of Fighters" for free provides behind-the-hospital graves to the heroes of the resistance and is praised as the last barracks of the veterans of the war.
Every year, before and after the National Days, there will be large public ceremonies and funeral ceremonies in the Garden.
Since 2015, there have been seven mass funerals of war veterans, in which 102 war veterans and their partners have been sleeping.
On 1 October, the new "Movement Protocol for the Three Gorges-Geco Dam Watering Hub " (hereinafter " Movement Control Protocol " ) was officially implemented by the Sino-China News Agency on 1 October, and the three gorge lifts were formally integrated with the gate after two years of piloting.
On the first day of the implementation of the new regulations, the three isthmus-Geco Dam waters are in good order.
On 30 September, at 2100 hours, the Yangtze Three Gorge Authority issued its first security plan and conducted screening of 160 ships, with 124 vessels in total.
On October 1st, 1400 hours, the traffic department arranged the first exit plan after the new regulations were implemented.
Following the implementation of the new regulations, the security plan is issued once a day at 9 p.m. and at 21 p.m., and the dam plan is issued at 14 p.m. and 20 p.m. each day, allowing ships the flexibility to plan the dam.
"Movement control" adds the "Corporate Control" principle for the movement of ships over the dam, specifying the priorities of the ships over the dam according to the gate and the function of the lifter, and adjusting the short-line passenger ships over the gate to the same priority level as the model and bona fide vessels.
That's two weeks after the lift was run, and it's officially coordinated with the gate.
For the first time, the new energy-powered ships have also been given priority by the large-scale pilot boats of the Kawaji River and the Tributary Bank.
At the same time, the "Movement Control" has been adapted from the previous 180-km near dam to the 541.8 km waterway between the Yangtze River Bridge and the Ishijiang River Bridge, dividing the "core waters, the near dam water, the control of the waters, the dispatch of the waters " .
This would facilitate the ship ' s choice of suitable waters to stand in locks and reduce the backlog of ships in the dam.
"Movement protocol" also provides for good faith restrictions such as the cancellation of a declaration of a vessel in violation of the law and a 24-hour delay in crossing a dam, based on the characteristics of the current vessel.

With the approval of Prime Minister Li Keqiang, the State Council has recently issued a Decision on the Management of the List of Licences for the Production of Industrial Products for Further Depression and Simplified Approval Procedures.
"Decision" proposes to further depress the catalogue of industrial production licences, to eliminate 14 categories of industrial product production licences and to delegate the authority of four categories of industrial production licences to the Quality Technical Supervision Department of the Provincial People's Government.
As a result of this reform, products subject to industrial production licensing will be reduced from last year ' s 38 types of pressure to the current 24 categories.
"Decision" is clear, with simplified approval procedures for products in the catalogue.
The first is to change the pre-licensing product test from the pre-licensing product test organized by the licensing authority to a product certification certificate issued by a qualified inspection body submitted by the enterprise at the time of application.
Second, in addition to hazardous chemicals, there is a back-to-back examination of licensed products by the Quality Technical Supervisory Department of the Provincial People ' s Government (market supervisory authority) and a formal clearance of the production licence after the enterprise submits an application and a product test qualification report with a commitment to ensure the quality of the product.
Three are the different categories of products in the catalogue of the enterprise's production, which, in accordance with the "one-size-fits-all" principle, will be accompanied by a review of the issuance of a licence when applying for a new licence or for a change of licence.
"Decision" requires that the regions, departments and agencies make a solid contribution to the efforts to reduce the inventory and simplify the approval process.
Increase the dissemination of corporate commitments and follow-up on site reviews, strengthen credit monitoring and restraint instruments, enforce corporate responsibility for quality, and revoke production licences whenever false commitments are not met.
For products that are subject to the elimination of industrial production licences, there is a need to effectively strengthen ex post regulation, involving public health and safety, and products such as environmental protection can be converted to mandatory certification, with positive lists and social publicity, harmonized certification standards, reasonable reduction and certification of testing projects, and mandatory certification costs are, in principle, borne by the financial system at all levels.
Support measures to encourage voluntary certification by enterprises, promote branding and market expansion.
To promote the quality of industrial products against internationally advanced standards.
Make full use of the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality of industrial products.
For products subject to the maintenance of industrial production licences, the standard system should be improved, industry regulatory advantages should be enhanced, "who approves them, who supervises them", dynamic assessment of product quality safety risks, timely decomposition of catalogues, delegation of approval authority or conversion to certification management.
In September, China's combined PMI ring was raised and the manufacturing PMI ring fell.
Data released on 30 September by the National Statistical Office of China show that China ' s combined PMI output index of 54.1 per cent in September was higher than the previous month ' s and annual averages of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that the overall level of productive activity of Chinese enterprises remained stable.
The manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which made up the composite PMI output index, were 53.0 per cent and 54.9 per cent, respectively, a drop in the ring.
Of this, China’s manufacturing PMI is 50.8 per cent, and the ring is 0.5 percentage points down.
According to Zhao Qing Hee, manufacturing PMI this month is characterized by five main features:
One is that the basics of manufacturing are generally stable.
Of the 21 industries surveyed, 14 are located in expansionary zones, where pharmaceuticals, specialized equipment, electrical machinery and other manufacturing PMIs are at a higher operating level of 53.5 per cent and are growing faster.
The second is small fluctuations in supply and demand.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0 per cent and 52.0 per cent, respectively, reflecting a decline of 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month, while supply and demand remained constant, but expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and the import index were 48.0 per cent and 48.5 per cent, respectively, below 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points in the previous month, and the climate was at its lowest point in the year.
Four is the increased cost of purchasing raw materials.
The primary raw material acquisition price index was 59.8 per cent, an increase of 1.1 percentage points over the previous month, and the exit price index was 54.3 per cent, the same as the previous month, which was all year high.
Five is that large enterprises operate well and small businesses continue to improve.
Large enterprises with 52.1 per cent PMI, the same as the previous month, have been in an expansion zone of 52.0 per cent or more since this year, and the production index and the new order index ring ratio have increased this month, which is the main driving force behind the expansion of manufacturing; medium-sized enterprises with 48.7 per cent PMI, which is less than 1.7 percentage points in the previous month and is located in the contraction zone; small enterprises with 50.4 per cent PMI, which is higher than 0.4 percentage points in the previous month, rising for two months in a row.
In that month, China ' s non-manufacturing business activity index was 54.9 per cent, an increase of 0.7 percentage points over the previous month and a two-month recovery.
Zhao Qinghe believes that the overall growth of non-manufacturing industries continues to be steady and positive.
The index of business activity in sectors such as road transport, securities, real estate, etc. continues to be below the threshold and the total business volume has decreased.
Reuters Nagoya, 5 November - Monday, the Governor of the Central Bank of Japan, Heroda, stated that the Central Bank was aware that the long-term implementation of ultra-flexible monetary policy could crush the profitability of financial institutions and could destabilize the banking system of the country.
But he said that, given the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the central bank of Japan needed to maintain its large-scale stimulus plan while paying close attention to the advantages and disadvantages of its policies.
" The Central Bank of Japan fully recognizes that, under continued monetary easing, financial institutions will be increasingly affected by their strength, " said Toyoshi Kuroda in his speech to corporate leaders in Nagoya.
He argued that if financial institutions were more proactive in taking on the risks to compensate for the narrow profit margins that had been caused by low interest rates over the years, the banking system could be destabilized in the event of a severe negative shock.
" Although these risks are not significant at present, the Central Bank will closely monitor developments and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures " , he said.
The minutes of the meeting of the Central Bank of Japan, announced earlier on Monday, showed that the costs of long-term easing policies had been rising during the September meeting of the Central Bank ' s Policy Committee.
According to the minutes of the meeting, one member stated that " the Central Bank of Japan will have more policy flexibility in the future if the economy continues to expand ... "
According to the minutes of the meeting, another member stated that, given the limits of the duration of the policy, the Committee should discuss how long the central bank of Japan could sustain the stimulus policy.
According to Heroda, the Central Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks associated with easing policies, taking into account the uncertainties surrounding Japan ' s economic prospects, which may affect global demand as a result of frictions and rising protectionism in trade between the US and China.
"The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is for the time being limited. "
" But how the problem persists, the impact on the Japanese economy may become greater " , he added.
" There is a need to sustain strong monetary easing policies while considering both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner, " says Heroda.
Despite the increase in the ills of radical stimulus packages, such as long-term low interest rates, which erode the profits of financial institutions, low inflation has forced the central bank of Japan to maintain the scheme.
The Central Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the dispute over the global trade war, he ruled out the possibility of a recent increase in interest rates.
June 1, 2018, business ID for the Tesla electric vehicle, Cardiff, USA.
Under a settlement agreement, the United States Tesla car and its executor, Mask, have agreed to each pay $20 million in fines to the financial regulator, and Musk will resign from his position as chairman of the company but will remain in the post of CEO.
The settlement agreement will end two months of unrest in Tesla.
The securities fraud settlement agreement disclosed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday would be a relief to investors.
Investors were worried that a protracted legal struggle would only further damage this still-deficit electric car company.
SEC sued Musk for fraud on Thursday, claiming that its 7 August tweet misled investors.
According to the tweets, he was considering privatizing Tesla at $420 per unit and had obtained financing.
According to SEC, these tweets are virtually unfounded and the resulting market turmoil harms investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts argue that the agreement may reinforce Tesla, who has suffered a heavy blow as a result of Mask’s recent actions.
Steven Heim, the head of Boston Common asset management, said that the settlement agreement should make Mask more supervised, without taking "destructive" measures to drive him out of Tesla.
The asset management company holds the Panasonic stock of Tesla's battery manufacturer.
Under this proposed agreement, Tesla had to appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop controls over Mask ' s external communications.
" It is in the best interests of our markets and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, that this matter be resolved expeditiously on agreed terms " , said Chairman Clayton of the SEC in a statement ...
Thursday's charges led to the evaporation of Tesla's market value of about $7 billion, which was $45.2 billion on Friday, down from $47.5 billion for utility cars.
The SEC withdrew its demand to remove Musk from the company's leader in the settlement agreement.
Many investors claim that this punishment would be disastrous.
"I think it's the best possible outcome for all concerned, " Ivan Finnseth of Tigress Financial Partners said that Feinseth gave Tesla a "neutral" rating, and that the SEC punishment was "punishable" for Musk.
"He's still a CEO. It's important to Tesla. "
Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the SEC allegations in the settlement agreement and did not respond immediately to the request for an assessment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
The Beijing Morning News (Reporter Wang Ping) Beijing Morning News journalist learned a few days ago from the Beijing Construction Workers Group that one of the core buildings of the Beijing Park Park Park complex - the Beijing Gardens project will for the first time use a multi-colour ETFE mural structure, 5440 m2 of film structure will be red, dark, green, orange, blue, red, green, six colours, with a butterfly wing under the line of Jang Lasso.

" From the sky, it's as if the colorful house was covered with flowers, danced with coloured butterflies, and the colour of the colours did not fade over time and with the wind and snow " .
Previously, the single-colour ETFE membrane structure had been widely applied to bird nests, water cubes, etc., but the multi-coloured ETFE membrane structure was the first in the country.
Journalists have learned that since there are very few suppliers with a multi-colour structure worldwide, each inch of the film structure material is " valuable " .
Liu Jiabao said that in order to avoid overlapping positions and "fight" problems, it would also be innovative to use the "fork ear" headline structure to ensure that the "fight" caps were in the right place through a specially designed fixed plugin.
The construction of the Beijing Park complex is currently under way.
Among them, the International Museum Project has completed all of the parachute hanging works.
It's scheduled to be ready by the end of October.

Secretary-General Xi Jinping made a very important statement at the private sector business colloquium, instilling firm confidence in the private economy as it moves towards a wider arena.
Xi Jinping's secretary-general stressed that "let the entrepreneur take off the burden of thinking and move on lightly" created a strong resonance among a wide range of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market dynamism comes from people, especially entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the 40 years of reform and opening up, there are millions of stories of entrepreneurial innovation, and the growth of the entrepreneurial community continues to drive China ' s economy to break down.
For some time now, people in society have spoken out negative and suspicious of the private economy.
The misconceptions about the "private economy out of business" and the "new public-private partnership" have raised doubts and concerns among some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered difficulties and problems in running their business.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some exporting enterprises; rapid adjustment of demand structures has put pressure on transformational upgrading; some policies have been inconsistent, policy effects have been added to each other, or the working methods have been simple, leading to the opposite of those intended to be good.
The combination of factors, difficulties in the private economy, difficulties in the running of some private enterprises, and a lot of anxiety on the part of entrepreneurs.
Against this background, correcting the misperceptions of perception, removing the burden of entrepreneurs ' ideas, allowing enterprises to pursue development with one mind and the Government with one heart to promote development, is of particular relevance in terms of market confidence and development expectations.
At the symposium, the important conclusion of the three unchanging was re-emphasized: "The position and role of the non-public economy in the economic and social development of our country have not changed!"
From further promotion of decentralization, the establishment of a power inventory system to the creation of a legal environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, the creation of a fair and competitive market environment and a society-wide climate of respect for entrepreneurs, in recent years there has been an unprecedented level of attention and institutional safeguards for entrepreneurs in the Party ' s central level.
The symposium was further marked by a series of practical actions aimed at private enterprise "false forwards" in support of policy initiatives in six areas of private enterprise development.
This is a great inspiration for the entrepreneurial community and more expectations for all sectors of society.
The fog spreads, the guidelines are set, the key is implementation.
To continue to create a better development environment for the private economy, to help private enterprises solve the difficulties of development and help to upgrade China ' s economic transition; to make entrepreneurs feel fair in competing markets, safe in legitimate operations, respectful in social life, stimulating creativity and creative potential.
The Chinese economy is entering the process of moving towards high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurial ambitions and providing greater space and arena for entrepreneurs to be creative.
We have reason to believe that, as reforms are further deepened and obstacles removed, the private economy will usher in better development prospects and opportunities towards a wider arena.

Sino-news and Hote's call of 5 November (Reporter Lee Episode) and Hut's Customs news of 5 November say that, as of that date, all 46 local import and export controls have been verified online, except for exceptional circumstances such as the need for confidentiality.
Inner Mongolia enterprises can file relevant documents with customs in paperless form, avoiding such issues as past field movements, paper applications, repeated filings.
It is understood that the lead time for document preparation, which refers to the preparation time for the various types of documents required for the import/export chain prior to the declaration of customs clearance, is a major factor affecting the overall clearance time, which must be reduced if customs clearance times are to be reduced and customs clearance costs to be reduced.
The total number of regulatory documents previously required for customs clearance at the import/export points was 86, involving 19 departments.
This time, according to the principle of "cancan be cancelled, can be combined, can be withdrawn from the port of exit inspection", based on the international trade "single window" platform, customs interfaces and data interconnections with 16 other licensing agencies, data multi-routing, and businesses less legs.
Customs stated that in the past companies had to return to and from the office halls of the departments concerned to submit paper applications, which were lengthy and could not be followed up in real time.

The export of chicken soup from Han to China has increased 20 times in four years or is associated with an increase in the number of young people in empty nests - the China-New Network.
The export of Han Xin chicken soup to China has increased 20 times in four years.
KUNA reported on 5 that last year Korean chicken soup exported more than $100,000 to China, which was about 20 times higher than in 2013 four years ago.
The analysis suggests that this increase is related to the increase in the number of young people in empty nests in China, which is responsible for facilitating the sale of food, as well as the increase in young people ' s interest in feeding.
This data was published by the Korean Agricultural and Aquatic Food Circulation Agency (AT) on the 5th day.
Last year, Korean chicken soup exports to China amounted to $1003.39 million and weighs 21.859 million kg, a sharp increase of 2094 per cent and 3668.8 per cent compared to 2013, respectively.
The analysis suggests that the increase in sales of chicken soup in China in Korea is related to the increase in the number of young people in empty nests, which is responsible for facilitating the sale of food, as well as the increase in young people ' s interest in feeding.

According to aT, avian influenza outbreak in South Korea between November 2016 and April of last year and a total ban on exports of chicken soup to China by the authorities resulted in a sharp decrease in exports.
The export of chicken soup to China in 2016 amounted to $0.84 million, which fell sharply to $100,000 last year due to avian flu.

The National Day is celebrated by a flag-raising ceremony at the mouth of the Central Vietnamese border.
" I can't believe there's such a spectacular flag-raising ceremony at the border, which is even more shocking than watching the flag-raising in the interior ... "
In the morning of 1 January, Mr. Zhang, who traveled from Sichuan to the China-China border crossing of the Yunnan River, and together with more than 500 troops, residents and tourists from China and China, watched the ceremony to raise the country ' s doors and celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China.
The estuary is the largest port in the Yunnan Sector of the China-China border, located in the Red River State Rivers County, Yunnan Province, situated across the river from Old Street City, Viet Nam, and falls within the national category.
As the country's "one-way" construction deepens, the flow of river ports of entry and exit has steadily increased as one of China's most convenient routes to South-East Asia.
At 7.30 a.m. on the morning of that day, the sun just turned to the tip of the corner, and the area of the port of the port of the river had already gathered the local population and visitors from the centre and the south to watch the flag-raising ceremony.

Following the commanding officer's raising of the flag, the raiser swarms his arms out of an arc, and the bright five-star red flag spreads its flag like the Eagle's Flying Wings, accompanied by a slow rise in the rhythm of the national anthem.
" In every New Year ' s Day, Spring Day, the National Day and other significant time nodes, the National Day ceremony not only shows China ' s image, but also inspires the love of the peoples of the border... "

According to the information received, the National Embassies Group, which is responsible for the flag-raising ceremony at the estuary, consists of more than 40 troops from various positions at the border checkpoint at the estuary, from a three-person flag-raising team to a large ceremonial team, which has gone through more than 60 years and has carried out more than 70 State-level foreign service courtesy missions since its establishment.
The newly amended personal income tax law adjusts the criteria for determining China ' s personal income tax residents to 183 days for a full year.
The Minister of Finance of China and the relevant head of the State Tax Administration indicated on 30 days that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law would be to consider continuing preferential arrangements for persons outside China, including Hong Kong and Macao.

During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, some positive messages were released around the Korean peninsula ...
The Korean President's text in Cao echoes the DPRK's "irreversible" nuclear abandonment resolve and says that US President Trump and North Korea's supreme leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of this year.
The United States Department of State subsequently stated that Secretary of State Pompero would visit the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea in October in order to facilitate the implementation of the commitments made by the United States and the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea ' s leader, Singapore, to meet in Singapore.
From the beginning of this year until the beginning of the year, the Korea-Koreans broke the ice and opened the path of dialogue, with inter-Korean, inter-Korean and United States leaders meeting. The general trend towards de-escalation of the situation on the peninsula has continued, and the principle of dialogue in resolving the Korean peninsula ' s problems has been upheld.
First of all, "the essence of the Korean peninsula is security " , and the key to achieving peace on the peninsula is proper and balanced resolution of the legitimate security concerns of all parties, rather than a mere pressure on each other to emphasize their own claims.
Secondly, in the dialogue to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties were still divided on the steps and modalities for the denuclearization of the peninsula, and, owing to the long-standing lack of political trust between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States, the idea of "who will take the lead" remained strong.
At the Council ' s open meeting on the Korean peninsula, which was held at United Nations Headquarters in New York today, the different voices surrounding the issue of sanctions against the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea once again highlighted the two points of " no change " on the peninsula.
U.S. Secretary of State Pompeyo insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean peninsula is completely denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, for his part, stressed the principle of "actional response", stating that "the downward trend in sanctions should be the same as the step taken by North Korea on the path towards nuclear abandonment " .
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement the resolutions of the Security Council relating to the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner, but that pressure is not an end and that the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are requirements of the resolutions of the Council, both of which must not be sidelined or chosen.
As stated by the Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in view of the current positive developments in inter-Korean and inter-American relations, China believes that it is necessary for the Council to consider the timely activation of reversible provisions, thereby encouraging North Korea and all parties concerned to take further steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back, the denuclearization of the peninsula and every progress in the peace process require sufficient political courage on the part of all parties ...
At present, and in the face of the growing expectations of the international community for a political solution to the issue of the peninsula, it is particularly important that the parties show political vigour, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve difficult issues and continue to make parallel steps towards the denuclearization of the peninsula and the establishment of a peace mechanism on the peninsula in order to create a permanent peace on the peninsula.
The people ' s government of Kie County, Nishang City, Shanxi Province, has received a message from the people ' s government on 1 day that during the national holiday, the Yellow Riverpot waterfall area in the county will remain relatively high and will not be open.
In order to ensure security, the scenery was temporarily closed during the National Day.
Yellowpot waterfall is the second largest waterfall in China, the largest yellow waterfall in the world.
The Yellow River flows here, the walls of the two sides are stale, and the mouths of the river are as tight as a pot, forming a thousand miles of the Yellow River.
According to journalists, June-October of each year is the Yellow River season, which has been closed for almost a month since 12 July 2018, due to the high level of the Yellow River and the continued closure of the Shanxi Yellow River Cave Area.
Mr. Ng Woo Feng, Chief Engineer of the Cattle View Area Management Board, told the media that this was the longest time the Yellow River has been in high water for nearly 20 years. " Not so long ago, we closed in 2017 for four days, and this year for almost a month... "
It is known that the Sanxi Yellow River Cattle Falls area was pre-positioned with additional staffing arrangements and vehicle maintenance, even temporary staff, to meet the 11th Golden Week.
According to the circular sent by the "Ombudsman of the Yellow River General Command for Drought Control" on the implementation of the Yellow River protection during the National Day, it is requested that the Yellow River guard during the National Day be completed in Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong Province.
At present, there is a high flow of the main river flow of the Yellow River, with the flow of the upper river remaining at 2,000 to 3,000 cubic metres per second, the flow of the middle river remaining at 2,500 to 3,500 cubic metres per second, and the flow of the lower river remaining at 3,000 cubic metres per second.
Influenza vaccination services provided by health centres and health posts, especially during the national holiday
This year, the Department of Health ordered 150,000 doses of the four-priced influenza vaccine for 2018-2019, giving priority at this stage to high-risk persons and providing vaccination against the influenza vaccine during public holidays. Health centres and health posts under the Department of Health provide vaccination services, especially during the national holiday (1 and 2 October) from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
In addition to the above-mentioned measures, the health centres and health stations under the Health Authority have, since the introduction of the plan, extended their coverage of influenza vaccination services on Monday to Friday until 8 p.m. As of 4 p.m. on 30 September, 4,158 people had been vaccinated, more than 3,714 during the same period last year.
Free vaccinations are provided to the following Macao residents: 6 months to 18 years of age, persons aged 50 years and over, pregnant women, all persons with chronic illnesses, including obesity (i.e. persons with a body quality index BMI of 30 or more), as well as homes, nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools, secondary school staff, all health workers, and Macao residents working in gambling fairs.
At the same time, other persons, including the public sector, who are deemed necessary by the Board of Health, will contact the relevant authorities on their own initiative to arrange vaccinations by the health centre upon obtaining a list.
In order to facilitate vaccinations and reduce waiting times, the Department of Health will send health-care personnel between October and December of this year to high schools, primary schools, kindergartens and nurseries, group influenza vaccinations for young children, young and middle-school students, teachers and staff, etc.; in addition, the Department of Health will arrange for group vaccinations to be carried out in old age and disabled homes, with a large number of public-sector or other institutions, etc.
Students and young children who have failed to participate in group vaccinations are entitled to Macao identity cards, Health Board user cards, influenza vaccination cards (if any), student certificates, employee certificates or professional certificates to the Inn Count General Hospital vaccination station or health centre as of 3 December 2018.
The Department of Health reminded the population that between September 2017 and August 2018, people who had been vaccinated against influenza from 2017 to 2018 had yet to be vaccinated against a new season of influenza from September 2018, as the influenza antigen component of the influenza vaccine from 2018-2019 in the northern hemisphere was updated for seasonal influenza from winter 2018-2019 and summer 2019.
Macao ' s influenza peak generally occurs in January-March of each year, later than in temperate areas (e.g., North China and Japan). The Health Department calls on the elderly, children, pregnant women, the obese and chronic patients, among others, to be vaccinated as early as possible against those at high risk who are more vulnerable to complications after contracting influenza ...

On the evening of 29 September, journalists learned from the propaganda department of the Qing Bai River District Commission in Cheng City that a row of cars, telescopes, liquid crystal displays and other goods in Central Europe had been reloaded through the Chemia Nufka crossing in Poland and turned to Nuremberg, Germany, on the evening of 29 September Beijing time.

1 October in Reuters - The quarterly short-view survey published on Monday by the Central Bank of Japan shows that the confidence of large Japanese manufacturers during the September season has reached the lowest level in more than a year because of the rising cost of raw materials and the effects of a series of natural disasters on production, which have put pressure on businesses.
The survey showed little evidence that escalating global trade frictions have undermined the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-blown trade war is a blow to business prospects and could threaten corporate capital spending.
Active capital spending is one of the bright spots in the Japanese economy.
The survey called into question the view of the Central Bank of Japan that a sound economic expansion would help to accelerate inflation to the 2% target, despite indications that firms were gradually passing costs on to their clients.
" In the context of concerns raised by the global trade war, the confidence of manufacturers has stagnated as a result of the slowdown in exports and the weak production of factories, " the Chief Researcher at the Golden General Research Institute in Agroforestry expressed the view " .
"Confidence is still high... and I don't think confidence will continue to decline as business profits improve and prices rise... "
Short-sighted surveys show that in September, the large manufacturing landscape was reduced from positive 21 to positive 19 three months ago, deteriorating for the third consecutive season.
The market estimate is 22%.
In September, the large non-manufacturing climate judgement index fell from a positive 24 to a positive 22 in June, the first deterioration in eight quarters.
The Reuters investigation is positive 22.
Surveys show that the December large manufacturing and non-manufacturing climate judgement indices remained stable.
Investors don't care about the decline in the short-term business judgement index, which rises on Monday, N. 225, to a high of 27 years, as a result of the continuous depreciation of the yen, helps improve the export earnings prospects of Japanese firms.
Capital spending is robust.
Despite the decline in corporate confidence, the latest short view highlights the robustness of corporate capital spending plans, the benefits of upgrading productive capacities and increased investment in robotics and automation to respond to labour shortages caused by population ageing.
According to the Central Bank ' s short-sighted survey, large enterprises planned to increase capital spending by 13.4 per cent for the current fiscal year, ending in March 2019.
The previous short-view survey was 13.6 per cent.
Nam Wuzhi said that capital expenditure plans for all enterprises in the current fiscal year had increased by 8.5 per cent, near the pace of the Japanese bubble economy.
He stated that " there is still room for further growth in capital spending in view of the expected increase in small-scale enterprises from now on, but much depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence ... "
Short-sighted surveys show that enterprises have increased their ability to transfer costs, with the large enterprise output price index of positive 7, the highest in 10 years, which is an encouraging sign of progress in Japan ' s efforts to counter deflation.
The index for measuring the employment status of large enterprises reaches negative 23, the most compact level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the job market.
As a result of strong corporate spending, the Japanese economy rebounded in the second quarter of January-March of this year.
But the rising trade frictions in the summer and the disruption of the supply chain by natural disasters have overshadowed the prospects of the export-dependent Japanese economy.
In United States dollars, the rate of increase in services imports and exports is 16.4 per cent.
The Ministry of Commerce website press release quotes the head of the Division of Services and Trade that exports and imports of emerging services exceeded $1 trillion in January-August and grew faster than the total.

Happy National Day of the Chinese People!
The price of oil or the "Step Up" will be filled up early on the Fourth of July.
On September 30, at 2400 hours, a new round of price-fixed oil will be opened in conjunction with the National Day holiday.
A number of agencies predict that oil prices will rise substantially to achieve a three-way rise.
The owners of the cars who plan to travel on their own can fill the car with gas before the price increases.
According to data obtained from crowd-based surveys, the corresponding increase in domestic finished oils is expected to be around $190/t; and the increase in intelligence estimates is about $220/t.
In September, the price of oil had already increased twice: on 3 September, petrol had increased by 180 ton, diesel by 170 ton, petrol by 145 ton and diesel by 145 ton on 17 September.
Domestic oil prices are tied to international oil prices, international oil prices have risen since the current round of prices, and Brent crude oil continues to be explored after it has crossed the $80 threshold.
As at 28 September, WTI futures in the United States had increased by $1.13 to $73.25 per barrel.
Brent's crude oil futures increased by $1.0 million at $82.72 per barrel.
" Given the international situation, tensions such as the United States sanctions against Iran have increased and oil prices as a whole have stagnated, followed by a clear refusal to increase production, market confidence and steady upward movement of oil prices ... "
Drozen's information-based oil analyst Xiwen just said.
In terms of retail sales, the price of oil in Beijing is currently $7.66 and $8.15 per litre for petrol at the Central petrochemical gas station Nos. 92 and 95, respectively.
According to Li Ying, the public information analyst, there has been no significant change in the preferential marketing strategy for retail distribution of gas stations, which currently have preferential margins of 0.5-0.7/l for major stations such as Central petrochemicals, and 0.5-1.2/l for private stations.
"The retail price of this wheel is about to rise `three consecutively ' , and the equivalent price increase is about US$ 0.14-0.16. It is recommended that the owners of private cars travel before the national holiday is full of oil... "Li Ying said.

Opening of the 69th International Astronautical Congress in Germany -- China New Network
The 69th International Astronautical Congress was inaugurated on 1 October at the Bremen Exhibition Centre, Germany, by Xinhua Society Bremen, Germany, on 1 October, with the participation of over 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and businesses, expert scholars and young students from around the world.
In his opening statement, the President of the International Astronautical Federation, Jean-Yve Legar, said that the global space industry was no longer a mere minority of countries and institutions and that the number of participants had increased significantly this year from the previous session, indicating that an increasing number of institutions and individuals were joining.
He called on States to strengthen cooperation and innovation to advance the cause of space.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Informationization of China and Director General of the National Space Agency, Zhang Kefuan, presented China ' s space programme at the exchange and indicated that China would expand its international cooperation in space and contribute to the cause of space for mankind.
The participation of representatives of relevant institutions such as the China Space Science and Technology Group, China Space Science and Technology Group, and a number of private enterprises demonstrated the latest achievements in Chinese space, including launch vehicles, satellites and space science and technology applications.
The International Astronautical Congress, which has been held annually since 1950, is the largest event in the world ' s aviation community.
The Congress, for five days, was co-sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Centre for Applied Science and Microgravity Research of Bremen University, the International Institute of Space Law and others.
According to a press release issued by Reuters Beijing on 5 November - China Foreign Trade Centre Sunday, the Guangxi meeting showed that China ' s foreign trade situation remained complex and that 80.6 per cent of enterprises expected exports to be better than last year or even year in the whole of 2018.
However, given the rising cost of integrated elements such as domestic raw materials, labour, and the external environment in which trade frictions between China and the United States have increased, the participating firms consider their exports to be less optimistic next year.
At the closing press conference of the 124th meeting, the Deputy Secretary-General, Press Speaker and Deputy Director of the China Foreign Trade Center, Xu, said that the number of foreign buyers and exports at the current meeting had been reduced by the same amount.
There were 189,812 participants from 215 countries and territories, down by 1.11 per cent from the same year.
Exports in the amount of RMB 2,06,494 million (equivalent to $29,860 million), a decrease of 1 per cent over the same period.
In terms of markets, for Japan, for the 10 ASEAN countries, the BRIC countries, the Republic of Korea has grown by 74.4 per cent, 11.4 per cent, 7.2 per cent, 2.5 per cent, 30.3 per cent, 8.9 per cent, 7.3 per cent, 0.8 per cent, respectively, in traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union.
In industry, transport, machinery, construction and decorative materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, sanitary equipment increased by 24.8 per cent, 21.1 per cent, 20.0 per cent, 15.1 per cent, and 7.6 per cent, textile clothing, domestic appliances, respectively, by 13.0 per cent, 6.7 per cent.
Xu, as a barometer of China ' s foreign trade and as a sign of wind, the data on the participation and export of the incumbent Xinxi buyers show that China ' s foreign trade development will continue to face many uncertainties in the coming year.
However, as supply-side structural reforms are advanced and recent national and local policy measures such as "six-stable" have been introduced, new dynamics in China's foreign trade development are accelerating and new developments in enterprise market diversification are emerging, which are important foundations and strong conditions for the development of foreign trade.
" Taken together, China ' s foreign trade exports and imports are expected to grow steadily throughout the year, with further improvements in quality and efficiency ... " .
The General Customs Administration of China announced a 14.5 per cent increase in exports in United States dollars in September, a 14.3 per cent increase in imports in September, a $31.69 billion trade surplus in September, and the highest export growth and trade surplus since February this year.
Although China ' s export performance in September was significantly over-expected, despite rising frictions between trade between China and the United States, with strong external demand and the devaluation of the exchange rate of the Chinese renminbi by firms before the United States imposed customs duties, or as a major enabler, and to some extent the resilience of China ' s foreign trade, the Chinese-American trade war struck confidence and the impact on the industrial chain, and analysts believe that China ' s external trade challenges may appear in the fourth quarter or next year.
According to the Reuters survey, in September the United States fund manager proposed an increase in cash holdings, maintaining a cautious stance as the United States and China began their latest round of import duties and the dispute showed no signs of détente.
However, the 12 fund managers who participated in the survey recommended that North America ' s asset allocation increase to the highest level since June 2017, while the United Kingdom, the eurozone and particularly emerging markets, have experienced a decline in warehousing.
Global stock allocation averaged 56.6 per cent and bonds 35.5 per cent, largely consistent with last month's survey.
The most obvious change is that the cash ratio rose to 5.1 per cent, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager from a large fund company said, " Some economic data bring confidence in the market, but the war on trade remains the greatest concern, so it is better to be prepared to enter the market when it falls ... "
But in September, the fund manager still favoured equities, especially in the United States, even though the United States stock was considered to be overpriced.
Today, in China's open landmark, the world's first large-scale national exhibition on the theme of imports — the China International Import Expo — officially opened its doors in expectations.
An exhibition is like a window that gives the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through the "window" of the Expo, people see a higher level of "open China " ; with the "window" of the "open China" of the Expo, the world is welcome to win with the "open China" China for mutual benefit.
"For a country, openness is like a cocoon falling into a butterfly, and it will suffer for some time, but it will be a new life... "
The Xi Jinping Secretary's summary of the Open Path points out an important reason why China can.
Looking back at 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which has dared to plunge into the ocean on the world market, has always faced all the risk challenges in an open posture, unleashing its internal dynamics and increasing its competitiveness.
It can be said that China has interpreted the value and meaning of openness with its own solid achievements.
At the beginning of a new history, the organization of an import-oriented fair was a major decision made by the party center of Comrade Xi Jinping to promote a new round of high-level external opening. It was a major initiative by China to open its markets to the world. It was a practical move by China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization. It demonstrated the strong and clear will that "China's opening doors will not be closed, but only larger."
And the great number of participants in the show and the "one hard to ask " are the greatest positive and optimal responses to the development of an open economy in the larger, broader, and deeper spheres of China.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
The build-up of the high walls of protectionism in some countries and the retreat from unilateralism have increased the international community ' s concern about the prospects for free trade and added to the uncertainties of a warming world economy.
In the context of these times, this great event on the eve of Huang Pu River represents China ' s defence of free trade, allowing the world to see open markets, shared Chinese confidence in the future and acted as China.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
China ' s open-mindedness and embrace of the world has not only contributed strongly to its own development, but has also brought China ' s great opportunity to the nations and regions of the world.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the creation of a " one-way " , launched the Asian Investment Bank and set up a Silk Road Fund ... China has provided a range of international public goods, provided real export markets, developed opportunities and jobs, and allowed enterprises to take the " Fast Train " to develop China.
The Expo is also a public product, a platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises in more than 130 countries and regions have taken a new step in the Chinese market with distinctive high-quality products and services.
In addition to national enterprises, there are domestic consumers who really benefit from it.
By setting up this platform for "optimal progress", it provides a multi-channel supply of good quality for consumption upgrading to meet the individualization, diversity and differentiated consumption needs of the population.
As China's open doors are opened, the flow of goods is smoother and the goods are used to their best, the steps towards a better life will be stronger.
From a broader perspective, the significance of the Expo goes beyond economics and trade to a vision of the future that conveys openness, inclusion, inclusion, balance, win-win ideas and forges consensus to meet today ' s challenges together.
The world is better, China is better, China is better.
We look forward to the great and successful event that will bring to the world; we look forward to a brighter future at a higher level of "open China" and the world working together to build a community of human destinies.
Foreign media: A framework agreement between the United States and the United States on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[Summary] The agreement includes Canada ' s opening of its dairy market to the United States and the United States ' temporary withholding of duties on Canadian-produced cars ...
According to external sources, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of 30 September local time that the United States and Canada had concluded a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.

More than 90% of Brazilian women voters say that presidential candidates do not take women's needs into account.
According to the South American diaspora, data published recently by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE) show that more than 90 per cent of Brazilian women do not think that presidential candidates take account of women ' s needs.
According to the report, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million, and if Brazilian women are brought together to form a country, the country will be ranked 13th in the world, twice the population of Spain as a whole.
In Brazil, women accounted for 52 per cent of voters and men for 48 per cent of voters. Although the proportion of women among voters was very high, the proportion of women in the Brazilian Congress was only 10 per cent.
In 193 countries around the world, Brazilian women are ranked 154th in politics, higher than in Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women have not succeeded in acquiring their rights.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori pointed out that the causes of this phenomenon were the result of an ancient patrilineal society, racism and the shared role of capitalist values.
" Politics should have been claimed by nationals for citizenship, identity, access to public goods and the formation of multiple social groups in the same society ... but Brazilian politics is the monopoly of a certain group and the majority of the population is not represented ... "
A previous study by the Brazilian Motors Institute (Locomotiva) also noted that 94 per cent of Brazilian women did not feel that the election produced politicians could represent their rights, 90 per cent of Brazilian women did not agree with the decisions made by politicians, and 93 per cent did not agree with the current government policy on governance.
"We need to reverse the underrepresentation of women in Parliament, and Brazil ' s political system continues to be affected by inequality....To date, Brazil ' s political sphere continues to be marked by serious gender, class and racial discrimination ... " Natalia Mori says...
Despite the lack of women ' s rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
Surveys show that 76% of women believe they can make a difference in democratic elections and 72% are interested in politics.
In addition, 55 per cent of women believe that democracy is the best way to make women less biased.

Following the flag-raising ceremony, Ambassador Zhang Zhang of China in Ha said that it was a profound patriotic education campaign that we held a flag-raising ceremony in another country on the occasion of the 69th birthday of the great motherland.
You've lived abroad for a long time, but you're always a great country.
Zhang Chang said that the Chinese people are today closer than ever to achieving the great goal of national revival and to the centre of the world stage.
" Our mission, our responsibilities and our work are more honourable, arduous and onerous than ever before... "
Zhang Xiang stressed the importance of keeping in mind his mission and promoting the construction of the "Standings of the World" by the Chinese and the Chinese and the Palestinian communities, and of the "Stands of the World" by drawing a more beautiful "Standing of the World" by "Standers of the Books" by building the nation and giving all his strength to the friendly cooperation of the Chinese and the Chinese.
The T2 terminal at Guangxi Guilin International Airport was inaugurated on 30th day.
According to Zhao Le Qin, Secretary General of the CCP Guilin City Council, the new terminal was opened to accommodate 12 million passengers a year, building a new advantage in the air traffic of Qui Lin, which is of great importance for further improving the traffic pattern of the Guangxi River, sea and rail connections, land and sea, and air ports connected to the four-bit "One" modern stereo traffic pattern.
Kiirin is expecting 90 million visitors this year.
The expansion of the T2 terminal and the side-famous facilities at the two rivers international airport is a major public service project for the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Guangxi Gang Autonomous Region and a landmark project for the construction of an international tourist destination in Guilin.
The project commenced in December 2015 with a construction area of 100,000 square metres, with a total investment of RMB 3,258 million, which will allow for 12 million annual passenger throughputs, 10.12 million landings and 95,000 tons of mail through.
On the same day, more than 200 flights took off and landed at the T2 terminal at Quilin International Airport.
The design of the new terminal, inspired by the waters of Kilin Hills, looks like a mountain crown, looks like a dragon ridge ladder field and a tumbled roof of the Quibei people, which is infested with the waters of Kilin Hill.
It was reported that the new terminal at Guilin Airport could accommodate a peak flow of nearly 4,000 passengers per hour to and from the port, using smart luggage sorting systems, security integration platforms, human face recognition and other "intellectual empty ports" techniques, planning commercial areas covering a wide range of businesses, such as catering, department stores, tax exemptions and recreation.
Because growth in Asia and emerging markets is largely not encouraging in Europe, the United States is increasingly becoming a major engine of global economic growth.
23 September 2018, a container ship docked in a port, New Jersey, United States.
But because the current growth in the United States has benefited from the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts, the economy has also received close attention from the outside world.
"As the United States is returning to full employment, it is inevitable that the economic downturn ... "
He said that the only question was when it would happen, and in his opinion, it might just not be pushed back.
Despite Barclay's optimism about the United States economic outlook by the end of this year, the Bank acknowledged that it was more difficult to predict further time.
" In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost the potential for economic growth, the current growth stimulated by fiscal policy will not be sustainable, " Barclay Economist says in a study ...
" At a time of lack of investment growth, the risk of the economy landing hard in 2020 will rise " , they said.
A series of business surveys will broadly show that major economies are at the stage of the economic cycle at the end of the third quarter.
The euro area and United States manufacturing surveys scheduled for Monday will receive attention and the services surveys will be published on Wednesday.
But next week's data will certainly focus on the non-farm employment data of the United States, which will be published next Friday, and which will provide clues as to whether the tight employment market is driving wage growth.
Its importance, not only because of its importance to the profitability of the enterprise and the purchasing power of consumers, but also because of the increase in salaries or the overall inflation increase, may be a source of concern for officials of the United States Federal Reserve (Federal Reserve/FED).
"Payroll will be of great concern, as the ring may have risen again from the previous month.
The increase in September is not likely to break 3% over the same period of the previous year, but we can well expect a breakthrough next month, " The Netherlands International Group (ING) Economist wrote in a study.
European politics could become a source of market volatility at a time when the rest of China and Asia are off vacations, leading to the region's bleak data coming next week.
The Italian Government ignores its previous financial commitments to the EU, and other EU member States will have to quickly determine whether or not they are firmly opposed to Italy's decision.Tria does not support this decision, and he wishes to abide by EU rules.
The annual meeting of the British Conservative Party in Birmingham may also be a firestorm as the British retreat talks enter a critical phase.
Meanwhile, concerns surrounding emerging markets are unlikely to diminish with Brazil's expected presidential elections next weekend.

On September 29, China's first 3000-ton-class large buoyship, the "Girl 22" ship, went under the China Warships Group.
When completed, the ship will break the current Chinese equipment bottlenecks in large buoys, submarine placement, recycling, repair and so on.

Under the influence of the typhoon, the pool has a strong wind, with a maximum wind speed of 24 knots, the departure signal has been delayed for nearly 90 minutes from 1 p.m. 30 p.m., the wind speed has not decreased, and the competition is being postponed until 1 October, when the competition will be cancelled by the Managing Director, Anne Mdrand.
"The strong wind from the shore continues, and the sea is so intense... "
Mdrand explained: " In such circumstances, no one knows when the wind will strike the ship. "
The race near the city, in the current state of affairs, is the wisest option... "
There's still a bit of disappointment for all ready crews.
"The ship is ready to stop, and we're in good shape."
Max Richardson, the Qingjia rudder, said: " But I know the game is the right choice, and I hope the wind will be smaller today, and we can do it again... "
Omika Wilkinson, known as the New Zealand team of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, said, "The day lost makes the game more interesting.
Because today's game's gonna be bigger and only two days left.
You're gonna have to do a lot of work. "

Despite the worldwide financial market shocks, the Hong Kong Financial Authority reported on Monday that foreign exchange fund investment income fell significantly by 97 per cent each year in the third quarter of this year, but was better than in the previous quarter, with overseas shares rising and foreign exchange losses significantly reduced as a result of the China-United States trade war.
According to the latest data from the Treasury, the foreign exchange fund recorded investment income of HK$ 1.6 billion in July-September 2018, which is significantly lower than the same period last year ' s HK$ 61.8 billion, but better than the revised HK$ 100 million in the second quarter of this year.
In the Legislative Council, the Managing Director of the Gold Administration, Chen Dejong, stated that the Hong Kong and emerging market stock indices were at odds with the United States stock index at the beginning of the China-United States trade war and that until late September, when the United States stock market index peaked in early October, market sentiment began to reverse, as investors became aware that the trade war had been detrimental to the United States itself.
" A change in market sentiment is a good thing, and if the trade war has only a one-sided effect, it won ' t help to solve the problem... "
But at the same time, he pointed out that " financial market volatility will continue to rise if the US-China trade war fails to resolve ... "
During the third quarter of the year, foreign exchange funds lost between HK$ 8 and HK$4.7 billion in equity investments compared to the previous quarter, while overseas equity investments increased by HK$172 to HK$12.8 billion; foreign exchange lost HK$16.2 billion and bonds decreased by HK$9.7 billion by 24 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively, on a quarterly basis, reflecting, inter alia, the general increase in the dollar against major currencies during the season and the three-point rise in United States fruits in mid-September.
Foreign exchange funds are used mainly to support HK$...
Hong Kong has had a system of exchange rates linked to the United States dollar since 1983.
With regard to the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Dejong stated that the financial system of Hong Kong is robust, defensive and resilient to increased economic and asset market uncertainty and downside risks.
" Hong Kong ' s international investment position is abundant, with a net external asset value of $1.4 trillion equivalent to 4 times GDP, 2.5 times higher than Singapore ' s and 0.6 times Japan ' s, with enough surplus to cope with the economic downturn or reversal... "
In recent years, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate has been steadily falling and has expanded with the United States dollar. Chen Dejong noted that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate had risen by more than 400 basis points on 21 September, and that the market is generally believed to be mainly linked to the increase in the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, which has since fluctuated at a level around 7.80-7.84 with the United States dollar, and that the recent decline in the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, which has increased with the United States dollar, may have attracted the market and increased interest-saling activity in the United States dollar, which has caused the Hong Kong dollar to again trigger weaker exchange guarantees more opportunities than in the previous period.
But he believes that as the interest-raising cycle of the Bank of Hong Kong begins, the normality of Hong Kong dollar interest rates will change in the future when Hong Kong dollar interest rates are lower than the dollar.
" The trend in the Hong Kong dollar and the United States dollar rates will be more consistent, and it will be necessary to manage risks with greater care and preparedness to cope with market fluctuations ... "
Due to the abundance of HK$, Hong Kong dollars has fallen further, falling by 0.9 per cent to 2.08179 per cent on three-month break-ups, increasing the difference from 46 basis points to 51 basis points, and from 120 basis points to 127 basis points on a month’s break-up.
From May to mid-September, the Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate for most of the time was close to 7.85 to $1.
During the period, the withdrawal of shares from Hong Kong dollars from the stock collection component following the closure of the arbitrage campaign and the large-scale stock collection activity led to a number of triggers in May and August following the first trigger in April by the weaker party ' s exchange guarantees.
The agency bought HK$ 7.85 at the level in accordance with the associated exchange rate system to find US$ in order to maintain stability in the exchange rate of HK$.
In May and August, HK$52.1 billion was purchased by the Financial Management Service under the weak exchange guarantee mechanism.
Does the new tax law also offer advantages to persons abroad?
In response to a 30-day question from a journalist, the head of the Department of Revenue stated that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law would be to consider continuing preferential arrangements for persons outside the country, including Hong Kong and Macao.
A journalist asked that the newly amended personal income tax law adjusts the rate for taxpayers in our personal income tax from one full year to 183 days.
Are there any preferential arrangements for persons outside the country, including Hong Kong and Macao, as the next step in the implementation of the Act?
In response, the Officer-in-Charge stated that the regulations in force for the implementation of the personal income tax law provide for special benefits for the payment of taxes to persons abroad, and that individuals who have no residence in China but have resided for more than one year or less than five years may pay personal income tax only in respect of a portion paid by a unit or individual in China.
The Officer-in-Charge indicated that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new Personal Income Tax Act would be to consider continuing preferential arrangements for persons outside the country, including Hong Kong Atoyo.
There's no "threshold" moon center: Quality certification leads to quality improvement.
As the two-child economy moves, the mother and child market booms from the north to the three or four-line cities, and every part of the city has grown into various classes of monsoons.
The popular demand for consumption was met by the very popular Moon Club, which currently had no threshold and there were gaps in regulation, with fees ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars, but at the same time it was in an awkward position.
A series of national "Quality Months" 2018 has recently been launched by the General Directorate of State Market Supervision, and journalists have come to a five-star moon centre in Tianjin City to visit their mother and child care service certification experience.
General month centres provide services such as neonatal care, feeding, postnatal rehabilitation and plastics.
In this month's centre, journalists observed that nurses check the breastfeeding of newborns on a daily basis, and professional nurses provide sophisticated care services such as bathing and touching for newborns.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of the new mother, the mothers are helped to recover their positions by providing services such as early care for the wounds of the Moon, nursing of the American body in the middle and middle of the month, and care programmes such as Chinese medical treatment of beauty.
One of the new mothers in the house told the press that she had been booked to the Kisaragi Club eight months earlier.
The services of the Moon Club directly affect the comfort and physical recovery of the mother ' s monthly child, and some small Moon Clubs can only provide simple monthly services with sterilized hygiene irregularities, vulnerability to cross-infection, dietary monoscientific problems.
The head of the Koshien Center said that they were the only ones in all five-star moons centres in Tianjin City who were certified as B-class services.
" Although some customers initially did not understand the meaning of B-class certification, it was important for the long-term development of an enterprise to benefit them through rigorous, standardized process management through certification that pushed down enterprises ... " , he said.
The Deputy Director-General of the Department of Accreditation and Supervision of the General Directorate of State Market Supervision, Panli Fen, said that certification of services was based on customer perception, that a new certification system focused on organizational quality management and the satisfaction of service characteristics was an important component of the country ' s quality infrastructure and had a positive effect on increasing the share of quality service supply and enhancing China ' s international competitiveness in services.
Since 2004, after more than a decade of development, the service certification project has undergone a process of gradual development, with the emergence of a number of influential service certifications, such as financial services certification, mother and child care certification, commodity after-sales certification, e-commerce service certification, health service certification, etc.
According to the General Directorate of State Market Supervision, there are currently more than 130 service certification bodies, more than 2,000 service certification officers and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates in the country.
Panliffe stated that further guidance and promotion of service certification would be required to scale up service certification coverage in areas such as health, education, sports, finance, electricity providers, and facilitate service supply side reform and quality improvement.
Reuter Hong Kong, 5 November - Hong Kong building prices fell for two months after meeting the top, and Hong Kong Financial Authority President Chen Deok-hyun said on Monday that it would take time to see whether the city had entered the down-cycle cycle and, if confirmed, to consider a policy of easing countercyclical measures at an appropriate time.
Chen Deok-hyun also said that, if the prices of the building were to return, the first people affected would be those who were to be employed at the peak of the city, but the expected price of the building, as it was during the Asian financial storm in 1997, was much lower than the opportunity for citizens to sell the property at large.
Chen Deok-hyun led a number of senior executives in the Legislative Council briefing saying that if it was confirmed that the city was entering a downward cycle, it would be possible to relax at the appropriate time.
"But it's a matter of weeks of data, and it's still too early to relax, and it's still gonna take a little more time to see if the city's going down the cycle... "
Since October 2009, the Agency has introduced eight rounds of countercyclical measures to improve bank risk management and earthquake resistance by substantially tightening mortgages in all categories of property, including by reducing the number of mortgages, and by requiring that mortgage applicants undergo rigorous pressure tests.
With Hong Kong officially entering the interest-raising cycle, the price index for private residential buildings for the whole of Hong Kong fell for two months in August-September, and the monthly decline in September increased to 1.44 per cent.
But the cumulative increase in the first three seasons this year was 10.2%.
According to the Financial Management Authority, the financial situation of households measuring their resilience to financial risks remains healthy, with 66 per cent of households without mortgages in Hong Kong during the second quarter of this year, up from an average of 60 per cent in 2009-11; 47 per cent of the average number of mortgages and 34 per cent of the contribution to income of new mortgages, respectively, have improved significantly from 64 per cent and 41 per cent respectively in 2009-11.
But Chen Deok-hyun said that high earthquake resistance does not mean that citizens already in business will not suffer from economic downfalls, because property valuations will fall and those who buy buildings will be the first to suffer at peaks.
Although the Monetary Authority has tightened bank lending to mortgage lenders, they can also obtain high-yield mortgage lending through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans from developers.
According to Chen Deok-hyun, at this point, together with mortgage lending to developers, borrowers can make up 85-90% of mortgages, and if the building price falls by 10%, negative assets (i.e. the market value of the property falls below the level of total outstanding mortgage loans) will appear.
However, according to the Vice-President of the gold administration, Nguyen Guo-hung, the authorities estimate that the total amount of mortgages provided by developers is only 2 - 2.5 per cent of the total amount of bank mortgages, which remains low.
At the peak of Hong Kong ' s negative assets in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, representing 22 per cent of the supply population.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets in seven consecutive seasons.
Xinhua Society, Beijing, 1 October (Li Hongxia, Mae) Retail E-Commerce Exporters, met another wave of tax benefits on 1 October, involving value added tax (VAT) and consumer tax exemptions.
The Ministry of Finance, the National Tax Administration, the Ministry of Commerce, the General Customs Administration have recently sent a joint communication clarifying the export of goods without valid import certificates to electric exporters in the integrated e-commerce pilot zone, on an experimental basis and subject to the following conditions: a value added tax (VAT) and a consumer tax exemption policy.

Second, export goods are subject to electronic commerce export declarations through customs offices located in the Comprehensive Test Zone.
Third, exports do not belong to the Ministry of Finance and the General Directorate of Taxes and Taxes, which, by decision of the State Council, expressly eliminates export refunds (exemptions) from taxes ...
The circular makes it clear that the General Customs Service regularly transmits electronic information on electronic commerce export declaration lists to the National Tax Administration.
The tax authorities of the Comprehensive Test Zones have strengthened tax-exempt management of export goods on the basis of electronic information on export declaration lists, which are cleared by the National Tax Administration.
The circular indicated that specific tax exemptions were developed by the provincial tax departments, the commercial sector and the commercial sector.
The leadership group offices and business authorities in the integrated development of cross-border e-commerce coordination and policy implementation should accelerate the establishment of a system for monitoring e-commerce export statistics and facilitate the rapid development of cross-border e-commerce.
A man in Liaoning province killed his lover and dumped his body, and then fled to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
On 5 May, the journalist learned from the police department of the East Victory of the city of Eldos in Neo-Mongolia that the man had been successfully arrested following a joint police investigation.
On 26 June 2018, a female disappeared in the city of Sainsan, Liaoning province, and her family called the local police.
As a result of a police investigation, this is not a simple case of human disappearance, and it is highly probable that the missing person was killed by a lover, and the police set up a special unit to investigate further.
On October 30, the Task Force found out that the suspect Wang may have been hiding in the East Victory of Eldos, and that the police immediately organized a good police force to cooperate fully with Liaoning's police in the investigation of the case.
After five days of reconnaissance, the civilian police finally figured out where Wang Bei was and detailed the details of his contacts.
On 4 November, the two police joined forces to capture the suspect, Mr. Wang, at an excavator's fittings store in East Victory.
According to the King, he had a relationship with the victim's lover, and because she had a large sum of money in her name, both decided to take it for themselves.
On 22 June 2018, because of his disagreement over the use of the money, Wang and Paik proceeded to kill him in the rental house and to disassemble the body and toss it.
At the moment, suspect Wang has been handed over to Liaoning Hill Police.
"Five Great Developments, the Great Enlightenment" "Green Development in Action" is wired.
The second column of "Five Developments, Good Angels" -- "Green Development in Action" was officially launched on 5th.
In order to provide a comprehensive picture of the remarkable achievements of the construction of the "Five Developments, Good Emblems" project, the Omega Track Company, together with the Golden Pulse Media Technology Corporation, designed the series of "Five Developments, Good Emblems".
Among them, the first train -- the "Innovation in Action" train was officially launched on October 1st on the Fertilizer Track 1 line.
The theme train on the line picked the blue green color that symbolized mountain water, reflecting the birth engine, vitality and purity.
The campaign focused on the concept of the "Five Great Developments and the Great Enlightenment" core and on the development results of the 18 representative green development outcomes in the province, including the Jianghu Canal Project, the Long Forest System, the Yangtze Economic Zone Conservation and the construction of green development priorities such as the Tens of Acre Forest Growth Project.
In addition, " Coordinated development in action " , " Open development in action " , and the "Shared development in action" thematic train will be on the line in the near future.
On October 1st, the first day of the "Golden Week" of the Chinese National Day and the last day of the Hong Kong National Day holiday, many residents of the Mainland used the holidays to travel abroad, to shop, and many Hong Kong residents returned to Hong Kong on that day, and there was an "exploitation shed" in Shenzhen ports, Lo Lake, Shenzhen Bay port, which opened 22 new self-service channels to improve port clearance efficiency and facilitate efficient and expeditious clearance of passengers.
According to data from the Shenzhen border checkpoint, as at 1600 hours of the same day, the Shenzhen crossing had more than 429,000 departures and departures, and the number of transport vehicles had reached more than 168,000 (one, rack, row), while the crossings remained busy and maintained a good order of entry and exit.
It is known that there has been a steady increase in the number of tourists travelling to countries such as Europe and South-East Asia on national holidays, owing to a number of positive factors, such as the increase in the number of countries providing exit exemptions for Chinese citizens.
In the early morning hours of 1 January, at the entrances of Lake Ro, Shenzhen Bay, the royal guard, Fukuda and other ports of departure, there was a peak in the flow of passengers, from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., and from 6.30 a.m. to 13:00 a.m. at the Shenzhen Bay port.
It was reported that, in response to the peak flow of incoming and outgoing passengers (cars), the Shenzhen Border General Post had been deployed in accordance with the National Immigration Administration ' s uniform deployment, initiating the passenger (car) peak hour service model, arranging overtime police to support the first line of duty, opening early foot-checking routes, directing passengers and keeping vehicles in an orderly fashion, ensuring that Chinese citizens were in a line of clearance for entry and exit for no more than 30 minutes, taking into account the efficiency of customs clearance for foreigners; and enhancing the maintenance of order in populated areas and ensuring that customs clearances were safe and orderly.
The Shenzhen border checkpoint also reminds incoming and outgoing passengers of their documents and visas, the validity of their entries, the reasonable scheduling of travel, the avoidance of peak periods, the selection of the right time and the right time to travel at the right port.
Passengers travelling to Hong Kong on the Hong Kong Highway must be provided with valid entry/exit documents and a visa. High-speed tickets are used only as a vehicle ticket and cannot be used as an entry/exit document. If they are unable to leave Hong Kong for reasons such as irregularity of documentation, they should follow the guidelines of the Border Guard and wait to be brought to a designated location by the Hong Kong Railways staff to conduct driving procedures to return to the Mainland.
Systematic haemorrhoids are a chronic syndrome of tired and all over the body, which used to be considered " incurable " .
It cannot be eradicated because of the lack of mechanisms for its occurrence, the difficulty of diagnosis and the lack of effective treatment.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the Faculty of Life Sciences at the University of Qinghua, and Mr. Chestnut, Director of the Centre for Rheumatized Immunization at the Beijing University Hospital, have found that human immune proteins have been subject to molecular mutations that increase the susceptibility of systemic haemorrhoids and that are involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, the two teams have confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of systemic haemorrhoid disease.
According to one of the authors of the article, Sun Xiaoqiao of the North Great People ' s Hospital, a team from Chestnut Nation collected and studied nearly 2,000 large samples of systematic haemorrhoids and found that patients with immune protein mutations had developed disease-producing cells and a wide range of antibodies of their own, kidneys, arthritis, mammothitis, vascular disease, etc., and that the incidence and severity of inflammation had increased significantly.
The Liu Wanli team, through various research methods such as immunocellation, animal testing, sequencing and so on, found that this immuno-molecular mutation-activated immune transmission route promotes disease-generating mechanisms in B cells for the production of multiple self-responsible organisms.
Journalists learned that the two teams were strongly united, taking full advantage of each other ' s strengths and bringing together basic research and clinical applications.
Liu Wanli's team is working on Blymph cell immunisation, immunisation studies, and chestnuts' team is engaged in long-term clinical research on systematic red-coated coronage.
" The study was one of the results of years of collaboration between the two teams and was the first institutional recognition in the academic community that immune protein gene abnormalities could induce systemic haemorrhoids, providing a solid basis for further academic research and clinical targeting for treatment ... "
It's not a bailout, it's a law.
A lawyer sitting in court with an axe?
The news was really exciting, and it blew up in the law circles.
The Central Law of Fujian Springs subsequently fined the lawyers involved $500 and advised the Quan City Bar Association in writing to conduct an investigation.
According to the Newjing newspaper, the former Quanzhou City Bar Association issued an official circular stating that the conduct of the two lawyers did not involve violations of the law and was not punishable under the law.
According to multiple reports, Quanzhou City Law Society deals not with short-term or confrontational treatment, but with the approval of Quan State Middle House.
An incident that could have caused tension within the legal community was eventually resolved properly.
The reversal stems from a more complete return of the truth: the axe carried by the lawyer in question is identical to the murder weapon of the defendant, the same type, but without opening it, and is supported by evidence only at the evidentiary level, without any intimidation or subjective intent to "imperil the safety of the court".
There are four very important details to determine whether the lawyer in question has acted in violation of the law: first, the local court held two previous sessions and presented only axe photographs, which, from the point of view of the defence, was necessary; second, the axe was purchased only an hour before the hearing, not the lawyer was unwilling to seek the judge ' s consent, but objectively failed to contact the judge; third, the axe was not used unduly or inappropriately; and fourth, the lawyer in question publicly admitted the error and apologized to the court at the first time.
Combining these facts, it can be seen that the lawyer in question is not guilty of anything but a defence.
After clearing up the whole story, the Quanzhou City Law Society took a decision not to punish, but rather to resist the pressure.
And this decision can stand the test of fact and law.
The fact that an axe will be brought to the court as a control knife without court permission is a real source of anxiety and misunderstanding.
For reasons of safety and caution, the fine and judicial advice previously issued by the Quanzhou Central Court are no less serious.
In order to preserve the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from making their case against them, the Supreme Law issued in 2014 the " Rules for the Security Inspection of the Judicial Police of the People ' s Court " , which establishes the principle that lawyers do not need physical security checks to appear in court.
Since the issuance of the rule, a wide range of lawyers have led by example, with few incidents involving security breaches that could endanger the safety of the Tribunal.
In very isolated cases like Quanzhou, misunderstandings are not difficult to overcome as long as they are communicated in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.
The Bar Association, as a self-regulatory organization in the legal profession, has a dual mandate of punishing misconduct and safeguarding legality.
In the past, IAJ has suffered from a severe illness due to its focus on discipline, its lack of security.
And the decision of the Quinzhou Bar Association, both in terms of process and outcome, is commendable and sets an example for more members of the Bar to perform their duties properly.
As of October 1, which tax revenues will affect our money bags?
The new personal income tax law of Xinhua Society Shanghai, 1 October, will be introduced on 1 January 2019 and, in order for the public to benefit as soon as possible from the tax deductions, the actual salary income of taxpayers will be deducted from the start point of $5,000 per month from 1 October, with the application of the new tax scale.
What exactly are the advantages and benefits that would affect the population with the new politics?
Profit one: significant tax deductions from salary payments
Taxpayers who receive wages after 1 October are able to deduct basic deductions of $5,000/month and apply the new tax scale, and most taxpayers have different degrees of tax deductions, especially for low- and middle-income persons.
According to the tax relief schedule for the different income groups, the monthly income after the deduction of the Triad is $8,000, $10,000, $20,000, $50,000. The tax-reduction tax is $90, 290, 1590, 9090 and the corresponding tax-reduction rate is 73.9 per cent, 61.1 per cent, 49.0 per cent, 18.8 per cent, respectively, compared with the start-up point of $3,500.
It is worth noting that, for holiday reasons, the salaries due in October to be paid by the law at the end of September may be subject to a new basic fee deduction and tax scale.
To this end, the tax authorities have provided the corresponding tax calculation function for the user withholding software, which is uniformly promoted by the tax authorities, but the corresponding tax is still subject to a declaration of payment during the statutory filing period.
Two: the low-rate grade range has increased significantly.
In addition to raising the starting point, the new scale will apply as of 1 October.
The current salary, the seven-stage tax rate of the salary, was the same as before, but there was a marked change in the tariff range, 3%, 10%, 20% of the three-time low tariff range, and 25% of the rate range was reduced, while 30%, 35%, and 45% of the three higher rates remained the same.
It is worth noting that the tax code also adjusts the tax rates for all stages of production operations, with the threshold of 35 per cent of the maximum tax rate being raised from $100,000 to 500,000.
This means that individual business owners, individual sole-sourced partnerships will benefit from tax changes.
" In the case of the previous Shanghai tax reduction for individual taxpayers, the dividends of a tax reform will be fully felt by the vast majority of taxpayers, especially by low- and middle-income people ... "
The head of the personal income tax division of the Shanghai Revenue Department of the National Tax Administration, Ramin, said...
Profit three: Tax services are easier to optimize
Since the promulgation of the new personal income tax law, the Shanghai tax authorities have undertaken a series of comprehensive and wide-ranging tax campaigns.
On the one hand, focus on tax sources, focus on businesses with "one-on-one, point-on-one" policy advice.
The Tax Administration of the New District of Pudong visited Apple Trading (Shanghai) Ltd., paying Bo Network Technology Ltd., Red Star Mei Kairon Family Group Inc., large numbers of employees, large surrogate payments, large tax revenues, tax departments offering counselling, and answering queries; and the Revenue Authority of the Xu Exchange Region visited the Small and Medium Service Enterprises in the Region, the China-China Shanghai Economic and Technical Cooperation Corporation, etc., to collect business concerns, respond to business claims and resolve business difficulties.
On the other hand, the tax policy of "all-dimensional, multidimensional, stereotypic" for the general public taxpayers is being promoted.
To ensure that policy advocacy is put in place, using channels such as Shanghai Tax Official, Micro-public, Micro-blogging, etc., to deliver policy hot spots in a timely manner.
At the same time, since 28 September, the Shanghai Tax Visibility Public Online 12366 Smart Counselling Platform has been implementing the "Target + Smart" Integrated Tax Reform Advocacy Service through the "Man & Smart" Tax Service Counselling.
On the evening of Beijing time on November 5th in China, on November 4th in England, the Red Cross officially announced that the former English captain, Rooney, would return to England to fight for the United States on November 15th.

It's the greatest honor of my career for England, and the 120th, and the last time I'll be here for England. It'll be a special memory to me. "

A tripartite trade agreement between the United States of America and the United States of America will bring new opportunities to 500 million people.
According to external media reports, the Canadian Foreign Minister, Freeland, and the United States Trade Representative, Leitschze, reported on the Canadian Government ' s website that the United States, Canada and Mexico had entered into a tripartite trade agreement, which would be known as the " USMCA " agreement.
Previously, CTV News Canada quoted senior American sources as saying that Canada and the United States had overcome their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post quoted two sources who reported that the agreement between the United States and Canada of 30 September would retain the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a tripartite trade agreement and that the three Heads of State would sign a new agreement within two months.
The statement stated: " Today, Canada, the United States and Mexico have agreed on a new trade agreement - the USMCA - which will provide a high standard of trade agreement for our workers, farmers and companies, which will lead to freer markets, fairer trade and more sustainable economic growth ... The agreement will strengthen the middle class, create high-paying jobs and bring new opportunities to some 500 million people ... "
According to the information received, the existing North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1994 by the United States, Mexico and Canada.
When Trump took office, he announced plans to reconsider the agreement and sign the new agreement.
The three countries started the negotiation process in 2017.
On the morning of 1 January local time, the Okinawa Supervisory Council election, which was held in advance of the death of the former Minister of Information, Yukio Yoo, announced the successful election of Danny Tami, who was opposed to the relocation plan of the US military base in Japan.
The result of the vote cast on 30 September was 39,663.2 million votes in Tam City, the highest in the history of the Okinawa governorship elections, and more than 80,000 votes more than his main contestant, Sasaki Jin.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a turnout of 63.24 per cent, a decrease of 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 Okinawa Prefectural Elections.
On 1 January, Tam City told the press that the results of the elections showed that the people of the county did not want to let the Governor's efforts before his death be in vain, that he would inherit the legacy of the Governor and continue to work with the Governments of Japan and the United States against the relocation plan of the United States military base and the closure of the Pantheon base.
The U.S. military base is located in Iyno Bay, Okinawa County, and has been plagued by disease, and the Japanese and American government had agreed to relocate it to the border of the city, but the Okinawan people strongly objected to the complete relocation of the base from Okinawa.
And with regard to the relocation plan and the withdrawal of land reclamation permits on the edge of the ancient coast, which were strongly opposed by the people of the county, the city stated that it had not been able to take a stand against and split with the central Government at the outset, and hoped that there would be a full exchange of views between the two sides, demonstrating an intention to reach a negotiated settlement.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also indicated to the media in the morning that he would take this outcome seriously and would make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and reduce the burden on the base.
At a press conference on 1 January, Japan's Chief of Staff, Liu Yi Wei, stated that there had been no change in the government's approach to moving United States military bases as soon as possible.
At the same time, he expressed his intention to talk to Yuzheng.
Jade City will officially become Okinawa County Governor on 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, Paul Thomas, a farmer from North Dakota State in the United States, has grown more soybeans in his land as Chinese demand for oilseeds has grown.
This transition peaked this year, with 1,600 acres of soybeans planted in 5,000 acres, reaching unprecedented levels.
But Thomas and a lot of farmers like him planned to switch crops from former American agricultural areas in 2019: corn and wheat.
American farmers grow soybeans in excess of maize this year for the first time in 35 years.
The reason for planning to switch to other food crops is because American farmers face difficulties selling soybeans against the backdrop of US President Trump's trade war against China.
China usually buys about 60 per cent of US exports of soybeans, but in recent months almost zero US soybeans have been purchased in recent months as a result of trade wars, resulting in soybean prices falling to a decade low.
Thomas intends to grow more wheat next year, hoping to earn more by reducing dependence on crops that depend on Chinese demand.
Thomas says the price of soybeans is a painful blow to us.
He indicated that without Chinese purchases, the spot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per burrow, while the price necessary to cover the cost was $8.50.
Soybean cultivation in the United States has reached a record high this year, and the harvest is expected to reach a record high.
At a time like this, when they're vulnerable, they're hit by a trade war.
In July, China imposed customs duties on imports of soybeans from the United States in response to Trump's tariff on imports of Chinese goods.
The United States Department of Agriculture will issue its first estimate of the area under cultivation next year, which will include a consideration of the impact of tariffs.
This estimate is expected to confirm the expected reduction in soybean soybean soybean soybean soybean soybean soybean.
According to a Reuters report, Informa Economics projected an increase of 4 to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in 2019 and a decrease of 7 to 83 million acres in soybean cultivation on 19 October.
Informa also expects a 4% increase in wheat cultivation in the United States.
The soybean area planted before the retaliatory customs duties was raised to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres higher than 10 years ago.
The area under maize cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008, to 89.1 million acres, and this year the area under wheat cultivation is 47.8 million acres, close to the lowest level in 100 years.
Aaron Carlson, President of the corn plantation association of Illinois, with a total area of 3,600 acres, spent almost half this year on soybean cultivation, but planned to reduce it in the future.
He claims that it may be possible to increase maize cultivation by up to 20 per cent on his farm in northern Illinois, the largest soybean State in the United States.
Soybeans produce less than maize per acre, but require less fertilizer, which makes soybean cultivation generally less expensive.
If farmers move to end-of-life maize, they may increase costs, but they will benefit a number of businesses, including Andersons Inc.
Executive Director Andersons Pat Bowe said to Reuters that he expected that the conversion of corn would be beneficial for fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the transfer of corn from farmers.
The Director General of the Asian Airport Administration in Bangkok, Suttilawa, Thailand, held an information session on 29 September to apologize for the beating of a Chinese citizen at the airport and to state that Thailand welcomed Chinese tourists and that the authorities would strengthen management, raise awareness of services and avoid similar incidents.
According to reports, on 27th, there was a physical confrontation between security guards at the airport and a Chinese man who was denied entry into the country.
Sutilava stated that the security guards involved had committed serious misconduct, that the airport authorities had suspended them and that a board of inquiry had been established to investigate the matter in accordance with the procedure, and that the security guards would be dismissed if the facts were correct.
The Thai immigration authorities have now arranged for the man to return to China by air.
Sutilawa apologized for this incident, which is damaging to the image of Thailand, and stated that the Thai side attaches great importance to the matter, is willing to do its utmost to reduce the impact of the incident on the hit tourists and will send a letter of apology to the concerned party through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said that the airport was ready to facilitate Chinese tourists to Thailand and that the Thai immigration authorities had established special access routes for Chinese tourists at the five main international airports in Thailand, in Sovanapur, Bangkok, Solomon, Chiang Mai, Puji, and so on.
He said that the next steps would be for the Airport Authority to overhaul the area of the site signature, to specify the cost of the landing and to improve the quality of service and communication capacity of the staff.
When the Chinese Embassy in Thailand became aware of the incident, he contacted the person concerned first to learn what had happened.
At the same time, the head of the Thai Immigration Service, the Airports Authority and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports addressed the Thai side to investigate the incident thoroughly and punish the perpetrators, and will continue to maintain close communication with the Thai side in order to deal properly with the matter and to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the persons concerned.
Xinhua International Times Review: In defence of multilateralism, China is aware of one thing.
The international rules and the multilateral order have been struck by the current tide of unilateralism.
To some extent, unilateralism and multilateralism have entered a critical period.
As a responsible major Power, China has joined the international community in upholding multilateralism and promoting it.
Faced with the new challenges of the new situation, China has made a loud voice on the direction and path of multilateralism.
As stated by the State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi in his speech during the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should be based on cooperation and win-winness, rule-based order, equity and justice, and effective action.
At the same time, China calls for the creation of a global development cooperation architecture that is centred on the United Nations, with North-South cooperation as the main channel, complemented by South-South cooperation, and for concerted efforts to build a community of human destinies.
China ' s reflections and voices reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As President Espinosa of the 73rd session of the General Assembly said, in the present situation, " the United Nations needs, more than ever, to promote multilateralism and uphold a rules-based international system " .
The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Lagarde, stated that the international community should remain steadfast in upholding the multilateral trading system, upholding international trade rules and resolving differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of global economic political forces, a number of emerging markets and groups of developing countries have emerged to play a greater role in the main international multilateral mechanisms, providing new impetus for the development of counter-winding multilateralism.
On this scale, China ' s advocacy of building a large family, rather than a small circle, adheres to the idea of multilateralism, such as co-constructing rather than winning, and adapting to the times, is a necessary option to meet global challenges and solve world problems, representing the common claim of most of the world ' s nations.
There's advanced ideas, more solid action.
China's One Way initiative has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China has launched international and regional cooperation initiatives, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the 16+1 Cooperation Initiative, to promote international regional cooperation, to complement existing international regimes and order, to bring about an innovative dynamic for multilateral cooperation and to contribute to the development of an international order that is more just and reasonable.
As a defender of the international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China ' s actions are becoming more and more powerful in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Good offices in international hotspots, response to climate change, participation in peacekeeping operations, efforts to reduce poverty and reduce poverty and help other countries to implement the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
As the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Guterres, said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the world faces a "trust deficit" and populism and polarization rises, it is the world's most pressing need for multilateral cooperation.
At such a historic juncture, the international community needs to join forces to translate consensus into action, firmly defending multilateralism and contributing to the creation of a community of human destinies.

According to the information received, five 4K live channels are now in operation in Guangdong, and on the same day, the National Day will be dedicated to broadcasting the 4K ultra-highlight channel of the central radio and television station.
The report reads as follows: 30 September is the fifth anniversary of the martyrdom of the country.
At 10 a.m. the same day, the Xi Party for Equality and national leaders joined representatives of the various sectors of the capital in a ceremony to honour the people's heroes and honour their martyrs.
This is the first martyr's anniversary since our heroic martyr protection laws were implemented.
Five years ago, on the eve of the National Day of Remembrance of Martyrs, the great journey of the Chinese nation from misery to glory was marked by a wake-up call: " Where do we come from, where we go " .
Secretary-General Xi Jinping pointed out that " [t]he abandonment of tradition would be tantamount to the cutting of his own veins " .
"Don't forget history to open up the future... "
Our heroism, our martyrhood, is to remember history forever, to keep our spirit alive and to bring together the powerful and positive power of national renaissance.
The English are the backbone of the nation.
Respecting martyrs and consecrating martyrs is the eternal memory of the highness, the sanctity and the strength of our hearts.
According to incomplete statistics, there are some 20 million martyrs who have lost their lives in national independence, liberation and prosperity.
Everyone who died for his country would be remembered, and every spirit of loyalty would be looked upon.
The establishment of national days for them and the organization of various forms of observance in the name of the nation are intended to pay tribute to them for their great service and to learn the precious spirit of their love of their homeland, loyalty to their people, selfless dedication and sacrifice.
The party governments at all levels have improved the system of preferential treatment and have continuously increased the level of pension treatment, and the party and the State have done their duty to honour heroes by acting effectively.
Every year, countless people look at martyred mausoleums, so that we can feel the deep feelings of the masses and the momentum of the national bloodlines for recovery.
Heroes, defends heroes, learns heroes, loves heroes in society.
In conclusion, we can say that today, when China’s characteristic socialism enters a new era, the glooms of sleep are: a powerful China is rising in the east, and the Chinese dream of a great renaissance of the Chinese nation is turning into reality in our hands.
Let us march forward with a spirit of strength and advance towards the great goal!

The fifth Disability Voice Month is coming to focus on sexuality education for disabled adolescents.
In recent years, the subject of sexual education for young people in China has been widely discussed, but the challenge for education for young people with disabilities remains daunting.
Recently, a workshop on challenges and practical strategies for comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to educate children and young people with disabilities about sexuality was an important topic for the seminar.
The report on sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of disabled children and young people in China, published at the conference, showed that disabled children were sexually harassed and sexually abused at a higher rate than healthy children.
For children with disabilities, adolescents, social attention is also "sexually protected".
The aim of the seminar was to promote comprehensive sexuality education for children and adolescents with disabilities in China from the standpoint of family support, school education and institutional services, to provide support to children and adolescents with disabilities from the source and to enable them to enjoy their right to love on an equal basis with others.
According to experts, the public perception of the disabled groups in Chinese society has remained at a level that is not sufficiently advanced.
Due to factors such as traditional attitudes, comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities, especially children and adolescents, is not sufficiently developed in China.
In recent years, however, with the support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the public good, the practice and path of comprehensive development of sexual and reproductive health education for persons with disabilities in China has been encouraging.
"Reports" show that children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical impairments who have difficulties in gaining access to sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relationships, although they may be more difficult than ordinary people, have generally become easier and enriched.
The Seminar on the Challenges and Practical Strategies for Comprehensive Sexual Education for Persons with Disabilities, sponsored by the Shanghai Foundation for Human Interest, the UNESCO Representative Office in China, the International Alliance for Disabled Persons in Beijing (France) and the UNFPA Representative in China, jointly supported by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in China, aimed at exploring ways and means of implementing sexual and reproductive health education in the context of a broad strategy for healthy China, promoting policy makers in the field of special education and integration of education, educators, researchers, social service organizations, parents' representatives and other stakeholders to understand the international policy of comprehensive sexual education and the right to health of children and youth with disabilities; to engage in a broad exchange of educational practices, strategies, challenges and resources for children and young people with disabilities in the country, to discuss and develop a blueprint for comprehensive sex education for children and young people with disabilities in the future.
Reuter Beijing, 30 September - Data released by the Central Bank of China on Sunday on net planned short-term outflows of foreign currency assets show that, as of the end of August of this year, the Bank ' s foreign currency had zero empty positions in its forward and futures contracts for 12 months, and that there were no positions in that month.
According to the Bank’s previous data, as of the end of August last year, the Central Bank held a total of $6.044 billion in empty positions for its forward and futures contracts, unchanged for the fourth month in a row; the size of the empty positions valued at SDR (special drawing rights) was 4,276 million SDRs.
Since then, the central bank's foreign exchange forward position has been zero.
The Central Bank released the data for the first time at the end of March 2016; the data show that at the end of February 2016, the foreign currency of the Central Bank had an excess position of $2,438 million in forward and future contracts and $28.9 billion in empty positions.
For the first time, the September data released at the end of October of the same year showed a net increase of $16,401 million to $45,301 million.
The Central Bank has previously stated that the foreign currency forward and future empty position of the currency mainly reflects its foreign exchange forward operations with commercial banks to meet the demand for hedges of corporate foreign currency liabilities, which will continue to provide long-term risk avoidance products on a demand-driven basis, with less impact on the size of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20th, K158 trains were taken to the crane wall by a classmate of Joe's high school in Zhengzhou.
One of the masters on the train bought a seatless ticket and took her seat: " Shoot, shoot, shoot. "
Two hours' drive, and the driver convinced him that an hour would still be a dead end.
In the end, one of the passengers in the same car couldn't look down and pull him up.
On the other hand, although most of the end results have been public condemnation, administrative punishment by the public security services, or even the blacklist of good faith, the public still feels that it is not " unchallenged " : why not let hegemonics be punished on the spot?
Why should they not be deterred on the spot from immoral or even unlawful acts, but only after the fact?
And why is it that a male passenger is being held up by a man for the unruly conduct of the Grand Priest?
This is mainly due to the fact that only long-distance trains are equipped with police officers and that short-distance trains are not generally available; even when they are available, they tend to worry about the possible rogue reaction of the ascendant and do not resort to coercive removal measures.
Repeated hegemonic incidents have led to the realization that hegemonics must be taken and even punished on the spot in order to act as a deterrent.
This requires that our train take strong and timely measures and that the non-police train be deployed as soon as possible in order to ensure that violations are stopped and combated in a timely manner.
On 1 October, on the first day of the National Day of Leave, there was a surge of vehicles in the direction of Songpan, Mau County, via the Sichuan Nortetchen Autonomous District.
At 1300 hours, the Kitagawa traffic police received a call for help regarding a traffic accident between their families in Songpan and the urgent need to send them to Siangyang for medical treatment due to the limited medical conditions in the area.
It's a one-way traffic control on the Toncho Lake ring road in Kitchen, and I'd like to ask the traffic police to release the 120 first aid truck.
Upon receipt of the call, the police officer on duty promptly reported the situation to the team, and immediately after Chief Wong Xuemin had been briefed, arranged for the police officer in charge to contact the caller and ask for all necessary escorts.
" With more than 1,000 vehicles entering the control section at that time, after contacting 120 first aid vehicles, it is expected that we will arrive in Kitagawa at around 1500 hours, and we will proceed immediately to arrange our deployment... "
The Commander of the Kitagawa border police station, Xu Wei, introduced the emergency vehicle as having to go around the lake roundabout in Tang Dianshan and the road was very narrow, so as to prevent vehicles that had already entered the road from travelling in parallel, the traffic police were on the road one hour in advance, with three points at the end controlling the vehicle, and reminded all passing drivers to take the side of the road and miscarry for the first aid vehicle.
The drumming squadron of police officers then suspended their vehicles from the control section and lined up for the 120 first aid truck that was about to arrive.
At 1500 hours, an ambulance with a Kawanze U license plate entered Kitagawa and a police car opened to escort the ambulance back into control.
It is known that only one vehicle has passed in some places around the lake, and that the civilian police have placed temporary control of these places in advance, ensuring the smooth passage of 120 first aid vehicles.
Upon arrival at the village of 10 miles from the moor, there was a road that could not be wrongly set aside, so the traffic police contacted the village councils in advance, borrowed the village lane and banned social vehicles from entering the village.
"it took only 40 minutes to get 120 first aid trucks from the Kitagawa traffic police to the normal road to 302 province... "
Mr. Wei said it would take four hours to pass, as usual.
"This arrangement has successfully secured a valuable treatment time for the patient... "
According to the information received, at 1720 hours the patients at risk were delivered to Myang in time for treatment.

"They took the money out of the passenger's pocket."
The civilian police, pointing at a broken coat pocket, said: " They cut the place open and stole $800 from a tourist who came to Beijing, and when we caught them, the money was just loaded into their own pockets ... "
The reporter learned that in order to catch the two men, the plainclothes police had followed him for an hour and finally caught him at the time of his murder.
Two suspects are currently being examined by the police.
The plain-clothes civilian police told reporters who was suspicious in the crowd that the problem was simple for the civilian police.
"As much as a thief is caught, their eyes, their deities and ordinary passengers, apart from staring at their pockets and their backpacks, they like to drill into the crowd instead of running away."
The civilian police also told reporters that suspects often have no purpose, prefer to wander around the station, find the target of the pick-up before they follow the car.
"It's all empirical talk. I've been working on plain clothes for a long time. I'll see. "
In addition, the civilian police have suggested that " it is convenient and vulnerable to theft ... " .
Be careful of your belongings while you're on a car trip, in case you get stolen.

Finally, the Managing Director of the airport, Sulinwa, said that while a large number of Chinese tourists were still welcome to visit Thailand, more assistance and facilities had now been provided to Chinese visitors to Thailand, including the opening of a special Chinese passport courtesy channel at the time of entry, 18 of which were opened at Suvanapu Airport, 21 at Sunman Airport and 18 at Phuket Airport; 8 at Chiang Mai Airport; and 10 for Chinese tourists at Chiang Mai Airport.
The Thai headline news network learned from the new head of the Thai National Immigration Service, the former Deputy Director General of Thailand ' s Tourism Police, Major General Surache, that the Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand had given high priority to the matter, that he had ordered the dismissal of the hit-and-run airport staff and that he had abolished the job search at the airport.
In recent years, there have been numerous incidents of school plastic runway irregularities.
To this end, the Ministry of Education has issued a circular requiring the implementation of the new national logo at the surface sports sites for synthetic materials in primary and secondary schools to be delivered after 1 November this year.
The mandatory national standard "Synthetic Materials Surface Sports Sites in Primary and Secondary Schools" was organized by the Ministry of Education and was drafted with the participation of 26 scientific institutes and testing institutions, after more than two years of revision, with over 100 expert meetings having been organized, as well as country-wide field visits, sample tests and the collection of hundreds of testing experiments on hundreds of enterprise products on the market.
In contrast to the 2005 old national standard, journalists found that not only had the new national standard changed from a " national recommended standard " to a " national mandatory standard " , but it also added a number of elements, including thickness requirements, physical performance, age-resilient performance, inorganic filling content requirements, requirements for high concentration of anti-sliding particles, limits on hazardous substances for surface finished products, limits on hazardous substances for non-solid and solid raw materials.
In particular, the new national logo limits the amount of hazardous substances that may be produced in the construction of the school plastic runway, from 7 to 18, and regulates the amount of volatile organic substances in the completed runway in accordance with domestic standards.
For example, the odour limits and odour requirements for hazardous substances in current and prefabricated surface finished products specify the amount of releases, requiring total volatile organic compounds to be no greater than 5 mg/m3, formaldehyde to no greater than 0.4 mg/m3, carbon dioxide to no greater than 7 mg/m3, benzene to no greater than 0.1 mg/m3 and odour level no higher than 3.
The new national logo also provides details on sampling requirements for plastic runways in primary and secondary schools, test rules, determination rules, etc.
In addition, for the first time, manual lawn on campus was included in the compulsory testing of national tenders.
In the near future, special work will be carried out on the implementation of the new national tender, which will be submitted to the Department of Physical Health and Arts Education of the Ministry of Education during the course of the year.

Activating rural consumption by cleaning markets, directing demand for healthy consumption and increasing farmers ' access to consumption.
According to the data, the potential of rural residents to consume continues to be released, with retail sales of rural consumer goods growing 10.5 per cent in the first half of the year, at an increase of 1.3 percentage points higher than in towns.
In a poor village in a county in the west, there was only one convenience store in the village, where some goods appeared familiar, "Golden Dragonfish" was marked as "Gold Dragon Oil", "Wanty" became "Wanty Milk", and "Colds" were a lot of goods.
Over the years, similar phenomena have often been exposed, and some of the poor rural commodities have been named with similar names, packed with similar packagings, in a way that is inexplicable and inexplicable.
A consumption survey published by a municipality in the west showed that rural traders had a serious problem with over-false goods, with 66 per cent of users buying fake goods at the sub-town supermarkets, with more than half of the food.
The authorities are cleaning up the rural market. Why is Lee still fighting?
Unlike urban markets, farmers are less aware of their rights, coupled with the remoteness of many rural areas and the blindness of their regulatory power, which gives rise to the breeding ground for false goods.
A commodity has a large headline, some have a price, some have a production, some have a market, some have a cross-functional function, have a year-on-year break, focus on the wind, hide from the wind, come out slowly, just after the old day off, and the new one comes out again.
The lack of long-standing regulatory mechanisms, the impurity of rural markets, the low cost of breaking the law and the high level of profit have led some illegal traders to get the wrong idea of going to the countryside, and some rural areas have become the "lost market " .
From subsistence to welfare, the farmers are moving towards growth-oriented consumption.
More recently, the Party Central, the State Council issued " Opinions on improving the institutional mechanisms for promoting consumption to further stimulate the potential of the population ' s consumption " , in which it was proposed to promote the upgrading of the rural population ' s consumption ladder, with the aim of enabling large numbers of farmers to " consume " , " want to consume " , " dare to consume " , and to make rural consumption truly more productive.
On the one hand, there is a need to deepen reforms and eliminate market regulation, management failures, local adaptation, food safety, product quality monitoring networks, constant reduction of rural leave, and market space.
On the other hand, greater law enforcement and regulation of the "furry veins " must not be allowed to thrive in rural areas for false pretences.
The harsh punishment of pit farmers should not be used as a justification for the creation of false commodities, no matter how hidden they may be, and the authorities should clarify their responsibilities, the low level of regulatory power at the grass-roots level, and the link between which is the problem, should be held accountable, the counterfeiting should be allowed, and there should be no safe haven for those who sell fakes.
Take market access seriously, apply stringent qualification checks on producers, keep the market open, get the product straight, clear the way, find a way from the source and root to keep the legitimate distributors safe and the farmers secure.
Activate rural consumption and direct demand for healthy consumption.
As consumption rises, many farmers not only seek to eat well, but also to pursue culture, good health and quality of life, not to treat rural markets as low-quality " cheap" paintings.
This requires promoting the extension of e-commerce to rural areas, the opening up of rural-urban and rural-urban two-way distribution channels, the integration of under-line industrial development platforms and online power trading platforms, and support for the expansion of new consumer models to rural markets; the promotion of the organic integration of market logistics and leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, among other things, in well-equipped townships; and the development of modern rural circulation networks, optimizing the integration of stock facilities resources and effectively reducing rural transport costs.
Creating a clear and secure market environment for the rural sector, which makes it difficult for farmers to consume more and more, and which enhances farmers ' access to consumption and well-being.
As of 1 November, we will reduce some MFN rates for commodities and the total tariff level will fall to 7.5 per cent
Pursuant to the decision of the 26th Standing Meeting of the State Council, the State Council Committee on Tariffs and Tariffs issued a bulletin on 30 November 2018 to reduce MFN rates for some commodities as of 1 November 2018.
Pursuant to the State Council ' s Customs and Excise Committee ' s Proclamation on the Reduction of Tariffs on Imports of Selected Goods, the MFN rate for some goods, including industrial goods, has been reduced as of 1 November of this year in order to adapt to industrial upgrading, reduce business costs and meet the needs of the population for multiple levels of consumption.

The tax is mainly on textiles; stone, ceramic, glass products; parts of steel and base metal products; mechanical and electrical equipment and spare parts, such as metalworking machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, electrical transmission equipment, electrical appliances, instrumentation, etc.; resource commodities and primary processes, such as non-metal mines, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, precious stones, etc.
At the same time, with the overall level of tariffs, particularly on pharmaceuticals, the tariffs on daily imports of consumer goods have been reduced downward and the tariff rates on imports of goods entering the border have been adjusted accordingly.
In follow-up to the decision-making deployment of the Party ' s central, State Council, we have imposed zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported medicines since 1 May, reduced vehicle and spare parts on 1 July, partially imported consumer goods, and implemented an information technology agreement extending the third step of the product reduction.
Journalists have learned from the Department of State Customs and Excise Committee that, since this year, the total tariff level has been reduced from 9.8 per cent in the previous year to 7.5 per cent, with an average reduction of 23 per cent.
Appropriate tariff reductions contribute to balanced development of external trade and higher levels of external openness, as well as to the integrated use of both domestic and international resources and to structural domestic supply-side reforms.
The relevant officials of the Committee stated that this year marks the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening up, and that the initiative to reduce the overall level of tariffs is a practical step in implementing the spirit of Xi Jinping ' s important speech at the Asian Forum, as well as an important step towards further expansion of the country ' s openness in line with its own high-quality development needs and its initiative to expand imports, which demonstrates China ' s firm commitment to a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy and, while enhancing its own development momentum, to make China ' s development more beneficial to the world.

"
The weather conditions are special in the boroughs, long days, very warm day and night, and the conditions for the cultivation of special and small grains are unique.

Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.2 per cent in July compared to the previous month, a higher than expected increase, warming the market’s expectations that the Central Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next month.
If it does, it'll be the bank's fifth raise in a little over a year.
The analyst from the Reuters interview had previously estimated an increase of 0.1 per cent.
Statistics Canada reports on Friday that 12 out of 20 industries are growing.
This data is noteworthy because the Central Bank predicted earlier this month that temporary factors might drag the third quarter of GDP data.
On Thursday, the Governor of the Central Bank of Canada, Poloz, promised that the Central Bank would continue to raise interest rates and pay close attention to economic data.
The next announcement of interest rates by the Central Bank of Canada will be on October 24.
The Central Bank of Canada has raised interest four times since July 2017 due to the strengthening of the Canadian economy and close to record low unemployment rates.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at Ken's macro level, said that the economy's third-season GDP ring was expected to grow by about 2% annually.
" This would be more than 1.5% higher than the Central Bank of Canada expected and would therefore be another reason to expect the Central Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month " , he said in a report.
The overnight index exchange shows that the market forecast for the Central Bank of Canada ' s October rate rises from 76.46 per cent to 78.27 per cent.
For the first time in 65 years, the Koreans jointly visited Hanjiang to the sea.
The Korean Ministry of Defence confirmed on 5th that on that day, Korea launched a joint expedition to the waters of the sea mouth of the Han and Pinjin rivers.
The initiative is a prelude to guaranteeing the free navigation of civilian vessels on both sides.
The Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Korea informed the media on the same day that this was the first joint visit of the two sides to Hanjiang at the mouth of the sea since the Korean War Armistice Agreement of 1953.
In September of this year, the Koreans signed a military agreement to undertake a joint study of the Han River into the waters such as the mouth of the sea, starting in November, in order to guarantee the environmental protection of the waters in the future, the development of tourism and so on.
In October, Korea planned a joint study of the waters at a meeting at the General level.
On November 5, the joint Korean-Korean water expedition was officially launched.
The joint mission consisted of 20 Korean-Korean military and specialists.
According to the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Korea, during this mission, neither side carried weapons and prohibited the use of words and actions to stimulate the other.
" Because there is no military demarcation line near the port of entry, the area was an unexpectedly high point, but through joint expeditions it will become a new zone of peace in the future ... "
The total length of the joint Korean-Korean expedition was about 70 km, with a total area of about 280 km2.
The Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Korea informed that the Korean side would send six cruise ships to detect seawater depths, etc., to provide basic information for safe navigation in the waters; once the investigation had been completed, navigation maps would be provided for civilian vessels to and from the sea.
The Korean-Korean summit meeting held in Pyongyang in October 2007 reached an agreement on the joint use of the Han and Pinjin rivers for sea access, but the subsequent talks were stalled due to tensions on the peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed by the Koreans in September, both future ships need to be informed of each other in advance before sailing in common waters.
According to the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia website, on November 5th, Chinese citizens Guo Yusang and Mao Yu-sung have lost contact during their tour in Mongolia in recent days.
It is understood that they were members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team and, on 19 October, they contacted their families and friends in the country, indicating that they were about to explore the mountains near Lake Kusuguor and shared their location via micro-mail, and then lost contact and suspected to have gone to the no-man's area.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights and security of Chinese citizens in Mongolia and to consular protection and assistance.
Upon being informed of the loss of contact between the two visitors, the Embassy launched an emergency insurance plan and tried to seize the time of the gold rescue and to work as hard as possible.
The Embassy maintains close communication with the family members of the person concerned, assists the family to report the incident immediately to the police and provides them with a list of translators for their choice ...
The Embassy met with the Ministry of External Relations of Mongolia, the General Directorate of Police, the Head of the General Directorate of Emergency Situations, to inform them of the situation, to request Mung Fong to conduct a search and rescue as soon as possible and to maintain close communication with M Mun Fong throughout the search and rescue process to ensure timely and up-to-date progress.
At the same time, the Embassy assisted the family in issuing a search-and-seek briefing in Mondon, and widely mobilized the active participation of non-resident and middle-income enterprises in searching for people, providing effective leads and providing relevant assistance to a number of Blue Sky rescue workers who were travelling to Monthuahua to assist in the rescue.
Thanks to the Embassy, Monfon sent a rescue team for the first time and promised to waive the cost of search and rescue.
The Police Directorate and the Emergency Directorate have instructed the Kusuguor Police and Emergency Department to search and rescue at full capacity.
Owing to the fact that Lake Kusuguur is located in the northern part of Mongolia on the border with Russia, is remote, sparsely populated, inaccessible and extremely difficult to transport and communicate, and that Mongolia is now entering a severe winter with temperatures of about 20 degrees below zero, the local police and emergency services have overcome enormous difficulties, mobilized almost all police forces and mobilized local herders, carrying out extensive carpet searches around their lost positions, including by riding horses, walking and visiting herdsmen.
At the same time, in view of the special circumstances of the pastoral area, Monfon has been issuing search notices through radio loops for many days.
The staff of the National Blue Sky Rescue Team have arrived to participate actively in the rescue, along with Monfon.
The safety of the two members of the United Nations has always held our hearts hostage.
So far, more than 10 days have passed since the loss of the two men, the Embassy has received some leads, but no two have been found, and search and rescue operations are still under way.
The Embassy will remain seized of the matter on the basis of the principle of "people-centred" and will urge Monfon to continue his search and rescue efforts and to provide maximum assistance to the families of the persons concerned.
The Embassy calls for contact with the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia as soon as they know the relevant leads.
