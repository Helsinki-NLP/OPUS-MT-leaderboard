Xinhua Time Review: Making good home-based migrant workers a rural revitalization force - Xinhua Network
Rural revitalization, talent is the key.
Where do you find talent?
The good return of farmers' workers is an indispensable force.
Xinhua Development Business Sea Chun
Xinhua Chengdu, July 26th, on July 26th: Making good home-based migrant workers a country-renewal force.
Zhang Hung, 34 years old, was in Orchard Village, Sichuan Meishan City, and in 2010 he resigned from Beijing's monthly salary to start a business.
After years of fighting, he now owns more than a million dollars a year, becoming a small, famous leader, and has been selected into the village's "two committees" team.
In recent years, a series of farmers, such as the national fight against poverty, rural revitalization, have been inspired by a range of farmers, such as Zhang Hung, have chosen to return home and activate a spring water in the country.
In 2019, the Western Population Province, Sichuan, the Ministry of Labour Export, was implemented by snobby guidance, and in 2019 alone, more than 8,000 members of the village party branch were produced from the back-up of outstanding farmers' workers, 61,000 village reserve forces, and over 20,000 members of the Development Party, providing strong assurance to win the fight against poverty and implement a rural revitalization strategy.
Kang is not a small man. It's important to look at the country.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young workers in the country have increased their businesses by fighting their own businesses.
But objectively, rural "empty" has also led to different degrees, especially the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations, and the village party secretary and the team of members present the "one-old and low" feature, i.e. age, low education, low education, poor leadership of village organizations, and the problem of yellow.
If the elements of rural talent continue to flow to cities, the countryside is in a state of blood loss, anaemia, and revitalization is empty.
Bring back the farmers who are capable, conscious and willing to serve their homes, and lead them back to their homes as leaders of the rich, and to develop from them as party members, village cadres, to enrich grass-roots cadres, which is a solution to the treatment of rural party members and grass-roots organizations.
Good farmer workers can get back, and they can keep it. Good job.
In recent years, Sichuan has been working hard to capture the Farmers ' Labour Party, building on strict selection criteria, building on strict selection criteria, institutional mechanisms such as service security, training capacity, selection and use, etc., to improve their abilities, work security, life hope, real roots in rural areas, and to have a sense of achievement in entrepreneurship.
This year is the year of the fight against poverty, and talent is a key factor in the fight against poverty.
The government of the Party Committees at all levels attaches great importance to the group of good home-based migrant workers, through comprehensive measures, creating a team that can hold, fight, carry it with no-go, force forces, and provide strong organizational security and talent support for rural escape from poverty and development revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates were a special one, and on the night of July 11th, the bilibili Summer Graduates brought a special live live live live show for graduates, wolf, Park Tree, Lee Woo Chun, Mao, and the musicians who sent songs and blessings to their current graduates.
The famous up master SealWu Wu Yifan also brought a "grass" song he's adapted to Lu Xian's same essay poem, which is very popular among young people.
Because of the epidemic, a lot of graduates failed to feel the sense of the field and the ceremony of the degree certificate, and they moved the sense of ritual to the line.
The data shows that this 2.5-hour song, the live population peak is over 35 million.
"Beware of your own heart, take advantage of the opportunity, and sometimes it's unexpected. "
It's a graduation concert, and many songs are touching non-renewal graduates.
"The whole scene really wants to cry, and everyone's youth is full of beauty and regret, but it's all worth remembering, walking with courage."
Beijing's natural ecology continues to be good, attracting over 500 wildlife cities to settle.

The capital's natural ecology continues to be good, attracting wildlife cities to settle.
Beijing wildlife has reached over 500 species.
The Beijing Youth Journal (Reporter Wang Bin) has been informed from the City Garden Greening Authority that the species and numbers of wildlife have continued to increase in recent years as the natural ecological environment of the capital continues to improve.
Currently, land-born spinal wildlife in Beijing has increased to over 500 species, including the protection of animals at the national level such as brown horse chickens, black tarts, and the zelopes, swans, grey cranes, thorium, etc.
Whether it's a urban forest in the second ring or a small wetlands embedded between buildings, it not only brings nature's wildness to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wildlife to "settling" in cities.
Summer Day, located in the Yanshan National Nature Reserve in the north-west Yanshan Mountains of Yanqing District.
A twilight is playing around the mountain, and two dogs are playing with each other.
Back to the end of 2019, a boar couldn't help but scratching the bark. The director of the National Nature Reserve Management Department of Pine Hill, Ho Chili, introduced that by the end of 2019, in this green sea of over 6,200 hectares, lived in 178 wildlife species, including the protection of animal gold sculptures and national level II protection of animal spoon chickens, antelope, where nearly one third of the city's wildlife species could be seen.
"In Matsuyama, wildlife is the real master, and at best our staff are their bodyguards."
Hu Chili said that, in order to learn about wildlife in the protected area, there are over 30 professional patrols every day, along 16 well-developed protection routes, and there will be a "turn circle" every month, almost all day long.
" During the patrol, not only the recording of biodiversity, but also the installation of artificial bird nests, the ambulance of injured wildlife, the installation of field infrared cameras, etc. "
The Matsuyama National Nature Reserve has now installed over 200 infrared cameras to record the living state of wildlife in the forest.
Hu Chili introduced that with the growing biodiversity of protected areas over the years, more and more wildlife appeared in the camera, leopard cats, tarts and pigs have become "resident guests" and the "scene rate" of the national level of protection of animal antelopes is growing higher.
Zhang Chi Minh, Director of Wildlife and Wetlands Protection, Beijing City Forest Greening Agency, introduced that Beijing's land-born spinal wildlife had increased from 461 in 1994 to over 500 today, and that the species and numbers of wildlife in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
The image of wildlife in cities is becoming more common and closely linked to the upgrading of the city in recent years.
In particular, the new round of greening of millions of acres of afforestation, which began in 2018, proposed to re-establish the urban environment, enhance the ecological function of the forest green land and highlight the concept of "near nature".
Planningly, trying to interact with the surrounding green, to facilitate wildlife "visiting friends" and trees are also the source of honey that animals love, food plants.
I'm committed to helping computers communicate with the world around us.
There are many ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers talk about what they see and understand.
Given this scenario, a modern computer visual algorithm, you can tell you that there's a woman, and a dog.
It can tell you that woman is smiling.
It can even tell you, this dog is very cute.
I deal with this, think about how humans understand and live with the world.
Those ideas, memories and stories, in such a scene, may attract human attention.
Interconnection of all related situations.
Maybe you've seen dogs like this before, or you've spent time running on a beach like this, and further raising memories and ideas about past vacations, when you go to the beach, spend time running around with other dogs.
One of my guidelines, by helping computers understand what experience it is, so that we understand the common ground of what we believe and feel, so we can start developing computer technology in a way that complements our experience.
So, deep-seated this, I started working a few years ago to help computers produce stories like humans, from the image sequence.
So one day, I was working on a computer to ask about its views on Australia's trip.
It looked at the picture, saw a bag bear.
It doesn't know what a bag bear is, but the computer says it thinks the bag bear looks like a very interesting creature.
And then I shared a series of images of the house burning with the computer.
The computer looked at the picture and it said, "This is an amazing view!"
It makes my back cold.
Computers see a terrible, life change and destroy life and think it's positive.
I realized that computers realized the comparison between red and yellow, and it was worth a positive assessment.
Partly because most of the computer I entered was positive.
That's because people talk about their experiences, they tend to share positive images.
When was the last time you saw a self-portrait at the funeral?
I realized that in improving artificial intelligence, it was a task, data set to data sets, and in computer understanding, creating huge gaps, defects and blind spots.
While doing this, I'm coding all kinds of prejudices.
Prejudice reflects a limited view, which comes from a data set -- which reflects the same human beings, such as stereotypes and stereotypes.
I remember the development of that technology, which brought me to the point where I was in that day -- the first colored image was calibration of the skin color of a white woman, which means that color photography was biased against the black face.
And the same deviation, the blind spot, continued to bring into the '90s.
The same blind spot, even today, still exists in facial recognition applications, how to identify different people's faces.
In today's research, I think of state-of-the-art technology, which tends to limit our ideas to a data set and a problem.
And we're creating more blind spots and prejudices, which are further magnified when using artificial intelligence.
I realized that we had to think about how we invented creative technology today, and how we were seen in five to ten years.
In human interaction with the environment, humans use time to correct the problem, so evolution is slow.
Artificial intelligence is developing at incredible speed.
It means it's really important, and we're going to think about it now -- reflecting on our blind spots, prejudices, and how these prejudices affect the technology we're creating now, and discuss what today's technology means for the future.
CEOs and scientists, have weighd their ideas about future artificial intelligence development.
Stephen Hawking warned: " Artificial intelligence can destroy humanity ... "
Elon Mask warned that this was a risk of existence, and one of the greatest risks we face as a civilized society.
Bill Gates said, "I don't understand why people are not more worried about artificial intelligence. "
But these ideas -- they're just part of the story.
The math, the model, the basic components of these artificial intelligence, are all we can get and use.
We have source tools open to the public to learn machines, and make their own contributions.
Besides, we can share our experiences.
We can share technology and its relationship with us, and how to make us jump.
We can discuss what we love.
We can communicate with the foreseeable future, and it might be more useful about technology, or more problems over time.
If we all focus on open discussions on artificial intelligence looking ahead, it will help create a conventional conversation and consciousness, about what artificial intelligence is, what can it be, and everything we need to do to achieve the best results for us.
We've seen and understand this in the technology we've used today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and automatic vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they good?
Yeah, so are they.
They're not exactly the same.
You've seen the light of the future there.
The future will continue to begin with what we're building and creating.
We started the Domino bone effect, which revealed the evolution of artificial intelligence.
In our time, it shapes tomorrow's artificial intelligence.
Let us be in the technology that strengthens reality, and bring the world back to life.
When people have difficulties in communicating, technology helps them share their experiences.
Technology based on online visual media can be used on auto-driving.
Technology produces language based on image understanding, which can evolve into technology to assist people with visual impairments, helping them to better have the visual world.
We also see how technology causes some problems.
We have technology today to analyze the physical characteristics of our birth -- like the color of our skin, or the look on our faces to determine whether we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data, we process data on sex or race, to determine whether we can get a loan.
Everything we see now, just a snapshot of artificial intelligence evolution.
Because where we are now, it's a moment of evolution.
That means what we're doing now, and it's going to affect the future, and extend it to the future.
If we want artificial intelligence to help humans evolve, we need to set strategies and targets, and open that path immediately.
What I want to see is the direction of culture and environment that suits humanity.
Technology can help us cure nervous system diseases or other disabled patients, so that life is as challenging as everyone else.
Technology doesn't take into account your characteristics or skin color.
I'm concerned today about technology tomorrow and ten years later,
Artificial intelligence can appear in many different ways.
But in this case, it's not an unmanned car without a destination.
This is the car we can drive at the same time.
We choose when to accelerate and slow down.
We choose if we need to turn.
We choose what artificial intelligence will be in the future.
There's gonna be a big arena that allows artificial intelligence to be everything.
It'll turn into a lot of different things.
It depends on what we need to do to make sure that artificial intelligence results are better for all humans.
Thank you.

Black Land "Specific" from Agriculture Modernization - Xinhua Network
Xinhua Harbin, July 26th.
In the summer, two jet jets crossed from the 10,000 acres of high-production demonstration fields in the fifth management area of Friendship Farm, forming two white lines, and green fields were particularly visible in the "first in the world" with black rice seedlings.
The station's chief hole says that this plane can spray more than 6,000 acres of arable land a day, about eight times more efficient than drones, hundreds of times manual.
This farm is located in the friendship county of Heilongjiang Province, the first-born food province, from the past rice cut to the sound of the motor of the "Ronglong" today, where traditional Chinese farming and farms have changed in this black earth belt.
Besides aircraft, satellites are used in modern agricultural production on friendship farms.
On the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precision fertilizer, reduce agricultural inputs and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standardization of agricultural fields.
During this year's rice production, the farm expanded the area of satellite navigation unmanned plug-in technology from 3,000 acres last year to 30,000 acres.
This technology makes seedlings more evenly planted, which maximizes the use of sunlight and arable land resources, saving $16 per acre.
New technologies such as farming in agricultural production have created the largest agricultural machinery in the country from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, there are currently 49,000 farm agricultural machines, with a combined mechanization rate of 99.8 per cent in fields.
Agricultural machinery operations achieve 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% of dry fields and 100% of dry fields.
" Green agriculture, intelligent agriculture, digital agriculture is the direction of modernization of agriculture ... "
The president of the friendship farm, Liu Yulian, said.
The key to agricultural modernization is technological progress.
The farm-based Heilong River Farmer Reclamation has played a modern agricultural carrier demonstration in recent years, leading the creation of a scaled cultivation, standardized production, industrialization as a leading modern agricultural industry system.
In the suburbs of Friendship County, there's a 350,000 square meters of agricultural machine fairs.
This is a central display of more than 140 agricultural machinery that has been introduced in Heilongjiang farmers for years.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the modern development of our agriculture.

Fu Quinbao said he had over 60 acres of land, planted rice, and he was doing well right now, "It was drugged yesterday, and the tools were not packed."
Fu Quinbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer in the corner, "No one wants to be flooded at home, and the house is for everyone."
In response to the continued high water pressure and possible heavy rainfall of the nest lake, Hoi Fat City, Anhui Province, is ready to launch the Chianggu River Union flood storage water on 26th.
The Chianggu River Union is located in Fatty County, near the nest lake embankment.
There are thousands of villagers involved in the town of Tung and San River.
As of 1600 hours, our fifth Great Freshwater Lake nest was still at 13.2 metres high, with a super-guaranted water level of 0.7 metres.
The Fukunbo kitchen is packed clean, and there's a pumpkin head on the table, eggs and some halogens in the fridge.
"I didn't think I'd move it. The water of Chiangguchi is now good."
Zhou Yan said it was a flat house, and some big things were not ready to put.
"First, pack up valuable things, refrigerators, TVs, big pieces that can be placed at high-level neighbors or relatives' homes for a while. "
The village cadres gave Fu Kunbao a plan.
Wang Li is in charge of the transfer of 13 villagers, one family notice to confirm everyone's placement programme.
The nearest place to the Fukunbao family is the Su Xiao Primary School, about 2 km.
Besides the big ones, there's more than 1,000 pounds of food and some new furniture in the house.
"The food is ready to drag to relatives' homes, and the furniture can't be moved."
The couple talked about a stool under the newly bought bed, raising the bed about half a metre.
At 6:00 p.m., Fu Quinbao started to transport things to relatives' homes, and Zhou Yan continued to pack at home.
At 11:00 p.m., the couple looked around and around home, pulled the gate and ready to put it in place.
"I hope the water will return early."
Fu Quinbao said.
On July 26th, at 9:30 a.m., the journalist saw it at the Jiangguchi Union, where they were ready to split the flood.

The French Church of Nanter Fire: The parish volunteers admitted to arson, and the usual and the New Net.
According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the famous St. Peter and St. Paul's Cathedral were severely damaged in a fire, and the cello was completely destroyed.
On 26th local time, the South Attorney announced that a parish volunteer who was responsible for defending the cathedral had been prosecuted for "arson destruction".
He admits he lit fire in the church.
According to reports, local prosecutor Senus stated that the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he lit three of the cathedrals at night.
The man's lawyer said that the arsoner now regrets doing this.
This man entered France a few years ago by asylum, was sheltered in the parish of this fire and was taken in the church.
The prosecution notes that he has recently tried to update his visa and is communicating with the police station.
But the church says it's still unbelievable that this man is usually very kind, smiling, but not very much, destroys the church he loves so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18th, the volunteer had been questioned by the police for having a logical problem in the narrative, but he was released.
It's a sign of firemen rescue at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, the man was sent again as a result of new evidence obtained by a professional engineer at the Central Police Laboratory in Paris.
This time, the man admitted to his arson.
It was reported that if the crime of intentional arson was established, the suspect could face 10 years ' imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to reports, the fire caused serious damage to St. Pierre and the Cathedral of St. Paul, the organ in the church was completely burned down and the colored windows behind the organ were badly damaged.
The chief architect of the French historical protection architecture, Brune, believes that conservative estimates that the recovery of the Nanter Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive message: American unilateralism undermines relations between the two countries.
On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the United States Embassy in China that China decided to withdraw the establishment and operation of the United States Consulate General in Chengdu and to make specific requirements for the suspension of all operations and activities of the Consulate General.
International opinion believes that unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious trouble to relations between China and the United States, and that China responded to the unreasonable provocation of the United States, and that it is legitimate and necessary to take countermeasures.
Andrés Bolks, Director of the China Research Centre at the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that unilateral measures in the United States had destroyed the bridge between the peoples of China and the United States and the United States and the crisisd relations between the two major Powers.
China informed the United States that the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu was a counter-measure of unilateral measures in the United States and in accordance with diplomatic practice.
Professor at the Catholic University of Argentina, Patricia Justo, Director of the Centre for Research, believes that China ' s decision is legitimate and necessary countermeasures for the United States, not against the ordinary American population.
The United States is trying to draw the attention of the American population by pressing China to cover up its weak response to the new coronary epidemic.
Banbon Suryono, President of the Asian Centre for Innovation Research in Think Tanks, Indonesia, said that the United States had taken a provocation diplomatic gesture that had caused serious trouble to relations between China and the United States and the United States and the two countries, and that relations faced serious challenges.
China informed the United States that the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu was a normal countermeasures, in accordance with diplomatic practice, reflecting both the principle of China ' s strong defence of its interests and the reasonable and favourable advantages of Chinese diplomacy.
Tanzania ' s current affairs commentator Francis Semwinza said that China ' s decision was a legitimate and necessary response to the provocation of the United States.
China and the United States should return to normal, and the United States should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interference in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to win economic and politically with China and how to benefit both peoples and the international community as a whole.
Ali Yusuf, Executive Director of the Arab-China Federation of Friendship Associations, based in the Sudan, said that China ' s forced countermeasures were a legitimate and necessary response to the United States ' unreasonable practices, in accordance with the basic norms of international law and international relations and in accordance with diplomatic practice.
The United States had previously requested the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston to seriously violate the basic norms of international law and international relations.
I hope the United States will withdraw its previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the return of the relationship between the two countries.
Singapore's Joint Morning Post published editorials that the larger strategic intention of the United States is to block China and stop China from rising.
In the face of the American pace, China is reluctant to see that relations between China and the United States continue to deteriorate, have to take countermeasures.

Hurricane Hannah landed in Midstate or triggered a river boom and a flood-China new net.
On July 26th, the Central New Net, the integrated foreign media reported that Hurricane Hannah landed in Texas on 25th, local time, and that it would cause a strong storm, a river surge and a life-threatening flood.
The National Hurricane Center said it was expected that Hurricane Hannah would blackmail rain, sweep the southern and north-east parts of the state, or causing some of the stream surges and life-threatening mountains.
According to reports, the most affected by Hurricane Hannah was south of Copes Christie to the Grand River mouth, and that the Rio Grande Valley could explode a wide range of mountains.
The Governor of Texas, Abbot, said, "Any hurricane is a huge challenge."
There are 32 counties in the state who are in a state of disaster as a result of hurricanes.
The city of Copes Christie, with a population of over 320,000, has closed down libraries and museums, and residents are waiting.
Abbot also said that the hurricane could no longer be allowed to bring more casualties to Texas as a new coronary outbreak is in Texas.
It is reported that precipitation in the southern part of Texas is expected to reach 6-12 inches at night of 26 days, and three to five inches of rainfall will also occur in northern Texas and the coastal areas of Louisiana.
Because of the effects of global warming, Hannah was formed earlier than the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
Normally, the first hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean usually takes place until mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from the European Treaty to Prevent Violence against Women
The Ministry of Justice of Poland stated on Saturday that Poland would take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women.
The Polish right-wing government cabinet stated that the treaty required school to teach students about gender issues and to trample on the rights of parents.
Polish Attorney General Jobro held a press conference saying that his Ministry of Justice would ask the Ministry of Labour and Family to start withdrawal from the treaty on Monday.
The treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
Joblow said, "The treaty contains elements that we think are harmful to mean. "
The Polish ruling law has close alliance with the Justice Party and its ruling coalition partners and the Roman Catholic Church to promote a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda used hostile rights as one of the main issues during the successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles (mostly women) protest against withdrawal from the Convention in Warsaw and other cities.
One of the protesters, Lempat, said in a protest march in Warsaw, "The purpose of withdrawal from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence."
Some protesters hold banner, which says, "The Law and Justice Party is the hell of a woman."
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
The former Polish middle-level government ratified the Convention in 2015.
The Government of the Law and Justice Party stated that the treaty does not respect religion and requires the teaching of liberal social policies in schools.
But the party has not decided to withdraw from the Convention so far.

Viet Nam is willing to share its experiences with ASEAN countries and to propose constructive peace measures on issues facing the Asia-Pacific region, including the East Sea issue.
With regard to Viet Nam ' s cooperation with Russia within the ASEAN framework, Grivori believes that Viet Nam supports Russia ' s cooperation with ASEAN to help Russia gain benefits in this cooperation framework.
The Asian-European Economic Union, including Russia, can enter the ASEAN market after signing a FTA.
Grivori proposes to maximize the expansion of the free trade zones between the Asian and European Economic Union and ASEAN countries, thereby creating platforms for economic and security stability.
Grivori also believes that Russia, Viet Nam and ASEAN are on track and will achieve their goals.
From now until the end of 2020, the North Gang province will have the necessary conditions, particularly in infrastructure, human resources and land, in order to actively bring inflows to foreign investment, especially multinational groups with value chains and transfer advanced technologies.
In addition, the North Gang province will submit the Government's Prime Minister ' s claim and approval of investment in infrastructure development and business projects in the Viet Nam industrial zone in the Viet Nam industrial zone to include additional documents for the integration of the two industrial-city-service areas in the province of Viet Nam by 2020.
Meanwhile, North Gang has focused on accelerating the progress of projects, particularly in infrastructure construction projects with industrial parks clusters such as Fu, Guangzhou, Twin Creek-Nine Emperors, to generate land funds for solicitation.
In 2020, the North Gang Industrial and Trade Bureau participated in the development of industrial zones, industrial cluster planning proposals to integrate provincial planning.
The North Gang Province has identified the integration of industrial parks with the security of defence, the protection of the ecological environment and food security, thereby contributing to the balanced development of industry; with a comprehensive infrastructure such as electricity, water supply, transport and telecommunications, and other social infrastructure such as urban construction, trade services, workers ' housing and health care, education.
In industrial zones, North Gang has focused on investment projects in high-tech, clean technologies in areas such as electricity, electronics, telecommunications equipment, precision machinery, assistive industries.
In industrial parks clusters, the province calls for small and medium-sized investment projects in areas such as production, use of local labour, particularly agricultural products, food processing.
In the future, North Gang will work to accelerate investment in infrastructure at the North Gang City Logistics Centre, to develop in parallel with industrial parks clusters to optimize goods, currency flows and help reduce production costs, increase the value of goods, optimize supply chains and develop multimodal transport, thereby creating an attraction for investors to invest in the province.
Upgraded Russian helicopter gunship card - first exit at the end of the year - Xinhua Network
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence plan, the Russian helicopter (hereinafter referred to as the Wu Nai) card-52M will complete the renovation and reloading and leaving the plant for the first time in December this year, which will be significantly enhanced in reconnaissance, communications and weapons performance.
According to the Russian newspaper News, Wutaka-52M, known as "Super Short Kiss Crocodile", was signed by the Russian military in April last year with military engineering units, and the first two upgrades are currently being replaced by the Far East helicopter manufacturing plant of the Russian "Progress" Aerospace Group, and its national testing and improvement will end by October 2022.
The Russian expert who was known to have described the above-mentioned upgrade was officially installed in November 2011, and the model exposed some weaknesses in its use, which was designed to "supple the shortboard".
Reports indicate that, compared to card-52M, which will partially adopt new protective materials that do not increase weight, and its pilot cabin will be reinforced and equipped with new equipment against missile attacks, thereby increasing the probability of survival in the field; the assembly of more powerful generators to power more sophisticated electronic equipment; the upgrade of the photovoltaic system, capable of reconnaissance and identification of field targets; new light multi-purpose missiles that are mainly attacking armoured combat vehicles and steel-band concrete defenses, with a range of 20 kilometres, with a range of about one times higher than the same missile range used in Russian active weapons; its defensive weapons and communications equipment will maximize the general purpose of the air target Mi-28NM helicopter, thus making it easier to maintain and economicly related maintenance.
In addition, card-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapons targeting systems and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also indicated that the concern was that Card-52M would be equipped with communication equipment to contact drones, thus obtaining information transmitted by nearby drones in real time in the air, such as showing the images taken by drones on the cabin screen of the helicopter.
As planned, the pilot of the card-52M can directly manipulate drones with it, thereby increasing the pilot ' s control of the field situation and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, the Russian Deputy Minister of Defence, Kivorucciko, stated last December that the Russian Ministry of Defence plans to purchase more than 110 martial arts cards-52M by 2027.
The new decree provides that the Campania region must wear masks in indoor public places from the immediate date, and that the violator may be fined up to 1,000 euros.

Hebei's ecological rehydration of 1.75 billion cubic metres since this year - China New Net
On July 26th, Xinhua, a journalist from the Hebei Water Department, has learned that since this year, Hebei Province has been using water and local reservoirs, and has been implementing eco-refilling water to 28 rivers and white ocean dots such as the river, Tang River, the rejection of the river, and cumulative completion of 1.75 billion cubic metres of river and lake ecological rehydration.
Hebei province has caught the favourable timing of increasing the flow of water supply in the north and north, using rivers such as the river to the Tang River, the Sand River, the Zhonglong River.
Meanwhile, ecological rehydration was implemented using nine large and medium reservoirs and white suns, such as the Western Ocean, East Wushu and rivers such as the Yang River, the Green Dragon River, which cumulatively formed a surface area of over 90 square kilometres.
To perform ecological rehydration, the Hebei Water Department actively organized a survey of water-refilling river hazards, repairing reinforcements and river cleaning, fine-tuning measures and strengthening patrols.
The problem is resolved in a timely manner through supervision and centralized covert visits, ensuring the safe and orderly of river rehydration.
According to the relevant head of the Water Department of Hebei Province, the orderly implementation of the river and lake ecological rehydration has effectively repaired the ecological environment of the river and the lake in Hebei Province, which has contributed to the recovery and conservation of coastal groundwaters, which greatly improves the habitat and economic development environment along the line, and is important for achieving the conservation of the river and lake management objectives of "water clear, shore green, river-screw, beautiful".
You should all know the truth I'm going to tell.
I think inequality can cause social division and corruption before the French Revolution.
The difference is that we can now find evidence that we can understand the impact of inequality by comparing society, with different levels of equality.
I'll show you some data and explain why those data are really connected.
But first, let's see how hard our lives are.
I want to start my speech with a contradiction.
This figure shows the relationship between our average life expectancy relative to gross national income -- the latter measures the average wealth of the country.
You can see those countries on the right, like Norway and the United States, and they're twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal, these left-hand countries.
But it doesn't affect the average life expectancy of their nationals.
There's no sign of interconnection.
But if we go to the inside of society, we can find a lot of health differences within their entire society.
This map shows an average life expectancy.
These are the towns of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
There's a big difference between the poor and the others.
Even those who happen to be at the top, they're in worse health than those at the top.
So income means very much in our society, but the comparison between different societies doesn't make sense.
The contradiction is that in our society, we look at relative income or social status, identity -- the relationship between us and the size of the gap between people.
Once you have that idea, you should think right away, what happens if the gap expands?
That's what I'm about to tell you.
I didn't use any hypothetical data.
My data comes from the United Nations -- like the World Bank -- about the income gap between these rich, developed markets, democratic countries.
The way we use, simple to understand, and you can download, which compares the top 20% of each country's income gap with the latter 20%.
You can see that the countries on the left are more equal -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- and their first 20% of their wealth is about 3.5 to four times the last 20%.
But on the other side of the more unequal -- Britain, Portugal, the United States, Singapore -- the income gap is double.
In this comparison, our country is twice as unequal as many other equally successful democratic markets.
I'll show you what this has done to our society.
We have collected data on problems arising from internal differences, which are more common at the bottom of society.
Internationally comparable data include average life expectancy, mathematics and language achievement of children, infant mortality, suicide rate, prison population ratio, early pregnancy rate for girls, mutual trust, obesity, mental illness -- all of which meet standard diagnostic classifications, including addiction and alcohol addiction -- and social mobility rates.
We put all this in a coefficient.
They're all weighted on average.
A country score is the average of these factors.
As you can see, these scores are related to the inequality I just showed, and I'll show these data over and over again.
The more unequal countries act worse on social issues.
It's very relevant.
But if you look at the same health and social problems compared to per capita national income and the GNI index, you're not gonna find anything, and there's no more relevance.
We have a little concern that people might think that we're choosing specific issues to accommodate our theory and then make human evidence, so we're also publishing a paper on the UNICEF Child Welfare Index.
It contains 40 different parts, a summary from others.
It includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether there are books in the home, how much immunization rates are there, and whether there is bullying in schools.
Everything's included.
That's the relationship between the index and the same inequality.
In an unequal society, the worse the child's performance.
Relationships and their visibility.
But again, if you look at the relationship between child welfare and per capita national income, you'll have nothing to do with it.
All the data I've shown you now reveals the same thing.
The average welfare of our society is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They're very important in poor countries, but not for rich developed countries.
And the difference between us and our position to others now seems very important.
I'll show you some branches of our index.
It's a mutual trust index.
It means the proportion of people who agree to most people are credible.
This is from the World Values Survey.
As you can see, on the more unequal side, about 15% of the people feel they can trust others.
But in a more equal society, the proportion rose to 60% or 65%.
If you look at community activity participation or an assessment of social capital, there are very similar connections that are closely related to inequality.
I'd say we repeated this twice.
The first time we were targeting these rich developed countries, and we changed the test to 50 states in the United States -- to investigate the same question: are the more unequal states do the worse they do in all these assessments?
This is the relationship between mutual trust and inequality from the federal government in a general social survey.
Very similar bulk distributions in similar levels of trust.
The same thing continues.
Basically, we found that almost all the factors associated with mutual trust reflected in international surveys are also reflected in the 50 states we investigate separately.
It's not a coincidence.
This is a mental illness.
The World Health Organization collects data through random sampling, using the same diagnostic interview, enabling us to compare the mental illness rate of each society.
This is the ratio of the population with any kind of mental illness last year.
It's ranged from 8% to 24% -- which shows that the proportion of mental illness in society is three times the proportion of other societies.
Likewise, these are closely linked to inequality.
This is a crime rate.
The red dot means the states of the United States, the Blue Triangle says the provinces of Canada.
But look at the difference in numbers.
Murder rates range from 15 per million until 150.
That's the rate of prison prisoners.
This is a 10-fold gap, and the index function will zoom in on it.
But the number of prisoners has changed from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main reason for this relationship.
In some places, crime can explain some of the reasons.
But more harsh trials, or more harsh trials.
The more unequal society prefers to retain the death penalty.
This is the dropout of children's high school.
Again, there's a big gap.
If we discuss the selection of social talent, we'll find that the gap is very dangerous.
This is a social mobility rate.
It's actually based on income flow rates.
Basically, it asks whether rich dads have rich children and poor dads have poor children, or has nothing to do with them?
On the more unequal side, Dad's income is more important -- for example, England, America.
And in Northern Europe, Dad's income is not so important.
There's more social movements there.
As we always say -- I know there are many American listeners here -- if Americans want to realize their American dream, they should go to Denmark.
I've shown it here with italics.
I can show you some other questions.
Those problems are more common at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with social gradients, which are worse in unequal countries -- not just a little bit bad, but what's two times ten times.
Think about the cost, the cost of manpower.
I want to go back to this previously shown map and we'll combine everything to explain two points.
First, by a copy of a chart, we find that countries with poor performance, whatever they are, seem to be more unequal, but those who are doing well seem to be Northern Europe and Japan.
So what we see is the relationship between universal social disorders and inequality.
It's not just one or two things that's wrong, it's almost everything.
Another important point I'd like to point out in this picture is that if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they show in all respects that they are very different countries.
The status of women, their commitment to small families, is in two extremes in rich and developed countries.
But another important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden has a big difference in income, but it uses taxes, state benefits, generous relief, etc. to close the gap.
Japan is quite different.
First, the Japanese pre-tax wage gap is smaller.
It's low tax.
It's got less welfare.
And in the study of the states of the United States, we found a sharp contrast.
Some states are doing well through redistribution, and others are doing well because of the small pre-tax income gap.
So we came to the conclusion that it was not important to achieve greater equality, and it was important to achieve it.
I'm not talking about full equality, and I'm talking about the real existence of democratic countries in rich and developed markets.
Another unexpected thing about this is that not just the poor are affected by inequality.
John Dorne seems to have a point: "No one is an island. "
Through a series of studies, we can compare the behaviour of every social class in different countries of equality or less.
It's just one example.
This is the infant mortality rate.
According to the British general socio-economic classification, some Swedes are very kind to classify a lot of infant deaths.
It's an inconformity of the age-based category of father-based positions, so single mothers make a set of data.
But we look at the so-called "low class of society," which is manual work without technology.
In the middle is manual work that requires technology, and then to senior non-manufacturing work, up to professional work -- doctors, lawyers, managers of big companies.
It shows that Sweden is doing better than Britain, doing better in every social class.
The biggest difference is at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society has some advantages.
We've shown five different sets of data, including the results of education in the United States and the international community and the health situation.
Overall -- more equal societies show the most obvious differences at the bottom of society, but there are also advantages at the top of society.
I should explain what's going on.
I think I'm showing and discussing the psychological impact of inequality.
More about superiority and self-esteem, being valued and despised, respected and devalued.
Of course, those feelings arising from competition for identity have contributed to social consumerism.
But it also leads to the lack of assurance of status.
We're more worried about how people judge and see us, whether we look attractive, smart, or something like that.
Social value evaluations have increased fear of these social values.
Interestingly, some similar work in the social psychology field is doing the same: some people have looked at 208 different studies; in research, volunteers were invited to a psychological test center and tested their stress Holmont and their reaction in stress missions.
In this observation, scientists are interested in which pressure is the most important pressure to increase the levels of cortex alcohol in the body, the most important pressure of Holmont.
The result is that those tasks that include social assessment of threats -- those that threaten self-esteem and social status -- are the ones that others can seriously evaluate your performance.
These pressures have very special effects in stress biology.
We've accepted criticism.
Of course, some people don't like this, and others find it unexpected.
And I should tell you that when people criticize us for picking data, we never did.
We have an unconditional rule if our data sources contain data from the countries observed, then we'll include them in the analysis.
Our data sources determine whether the data is valid, not us.
Otherwise, there's a deviation.
What about the other countries?
In the academic peer review journal, 200 studies are about the relationship between health and income and equality.
It's not limited to these countries, but it's a simple proof.
The same country, the same inequality measurement method, the problem one after the other.
Why don't we control other factors?
I've shown you that per capita national income has not had any impact.
Of course, others have applied more complex methods in the literature to exclude poverty, education, etc. in experiments.
How's the causality?
Relevance does not in itself prove causality.
We spent a lot of time.
Indeed, people know the causality of our results.
The biggest change in our understanding of the long-term health drivers of rich developed countries is how important long-term stress from society is how important it is to be immune and cardiovascular systems.
Or, for example, violence is becoming more common in more unequal countries because people are very sensitive to themselves.
I'd say, in order to solve this problem, we should solve a series of problems after taxes and pre-tax problems.
We should limit our income, contain the top-end bonus income culture.
I think we have to do everything we can to get our leaders responsible for our staff.
The last thing I want to summarize is that we can improve our real quality of life by reducing our income gap.
In that case, we'll find out that we suddenly solved the social mental health problems of society, which is amazing.
Thank you.

In the last two weeks, the new crown cases in Spain have risen significantly, with thousands of new cases on several days.
The British government decided on Saturday, 25 July, to remove Spain from the safe travel list from the safe travel list from 26 p.m. local time, and that persons entering the United Kingdom from Spain must be isolated for 14 days.
British tourists who are on vacation in Spain have been surprised, worried, even angry, because the news is so sudden, it's a surprise.
According to reports, British Minister of Transport Grant Shaps is currently on vacation in Spain.
Before Britain issued quarantine measures, Norway had announced that people returning from Spain to Norway for a 10-day isolation.
France and Belgium recommended that their residents abandon their plans for vacations ahead of Barcelona and the surrounding areas.
The beaches in these areas are overcrowded, and people are unable to maintain social distance, and the police once need to take measures to reduce the number of beach tourists.
Tourism is a major pillar of Spain.
Spain: This is safe.
In response to the British decision, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on Sunday that the outbreak was controlled.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya stressed to the media: " Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists. "
The Spanish Government will try to convince the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from quarantine measures.
The reason is, these two tourist resorts have a much lower infection rate than on British soil.
To prevent the spread of the epidemic, Catalonia, Spain has also re-established the Ban Order.
Tourism is a major pillar of Spain, and Spain is one of the most popular resorts for British tourists.
This British decision is expected to affect Spanish tourism.

The first day of the Middle Volt: Beijing is not hot and cool.
July 26th, Xinhua, Beijing, July 26th, is the first day of the year's Middle Volt.
The early 26th morning stormed the weather, scattered the heat and heat in Beijing, and the new rainfall will last for days.
Beijing Weather Station was released at 11100 hours on 26th that Beijing had a decentralized shower (with weak lightning), with a maximum temperature of 27 degrees C in the day; there was a small to mid rain at night (with weak thunder) and a minimum temperature of 23 degrees C at night.
In the previous 24-25 days, Beijing was in a high temperature blue warning, with the highest temperature in large areas around 37 degrees C, with a high temperature of more than 40 degrees C.
The sky is the highest temperature in a year, wet, hot, three volts a year, the hottest in the middle, and the Chinese people say "suffering summer" right now.
When you're in, the house was filled with barns, and the folk said "one drop of dumplings."
According to the current forecast, the next three days, Beijing is raining.
The weather department suggests that the public minimize mountain play and be careful to prevent geological disasters.
It is understood that 20 days this year's "middle Volk" started on July 26th, until August 14.
When you get into the middle, people feel weak and hungry.
Foods like green beans, gills, etc., can help to improve appetite and heat and heat, and bitter foods like bitter vegetables, bitter melons, can help to improve appetite and heat.
The engine could be out of the engine.
The United States Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) issued an emergency shipping order on 24th, requiring an emergency inspection of approximately 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737 Classic passenger aircraft registered in the United States because the air stop valves of the above-mentioned passenger aircraft could cause engine air parking.
The Federal Aviation Agency stated that 4 737 NG and 737Classic passenger engines had been received to date, resulting in urgent inspection requirements for passenger aircraft for seven days or more and more than 11 passenger aircraft to date after re-entry.
The Federal Aviation Agency warned that if all two engines of the passenger aircraft were corrosive and could be stuck in open position, causing the passenger aircraft to lose power and unable to restart the engine.
This aviation regulatory agency ordered that once the stop valves are found to be corrosive, the aviation operator must replace this critical component before the passenger aircraft is re-entered.
Boeing responded later that day that the outbreak of the new coronary outbreak led to lower travel demand, and many passenger aircraft were sealed or less used, and " stop valves are more corrosive " .
Boeing also said that the air operator had been advised to check the passenger aircraft involved in the instructions and if the problem is found, Boeing will provide assistance in the repair and replacement of the stop valve.
Associated Press reports that passenger aircraft under the flag of major American air operators usually fly several times in a day, but after the outbreak of the new crown outbreak, a large number of passenger aircraft stopped; as the demand for passengers ' travel has recently increased slowly, some passenger aircraft are re-entered.
The Federal Aviation Agency did not issue details of four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines revealed one of these incidents later on 24th.
In his statement, this airline operator said that a passenger plane was flying from Seattle, Washington, Washington, to Austin, Texas, on the way to Austin, and that the passenger plane had finally landed at Austin Airport on July 15th.
Alaska Airlines said that the engine of the passenger plane had been replaced and that six passenger engines had been checked as ordered by the Federal Aviation Agency.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on 24th, respectively, that there was no engine out of the air stop valves under the flag.
Four passenger planes under the banner of American Airlines will be checked, and 28 passenger aircraft under the United Airlines flag will be checked.
Damme Airlines said it would check 20 passenger planes under the flag, but did not indicate whether the engine went out.
Many media reports, the Federal Aviation Agency's emergency navigational order is another shock to Boeing.
A Boeing 737MAX passenger aircraft of Indonesian Lions Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, killing 346 people.
This series of passenger aircraft was then suspended globally, closed production in January this year and resumed production in May.
Steve Dixon, Director of the Federal Aviation Agency, admitted in June that the Federal Aviation Agency had made a mistake on Boeing's supervision.
"Dinking on the line! Teacher" is on the line next week.
There's a new art online.
Interactive knowledge sharing program "Ding on the line! Teacher" will be broadcast in Hunan Watch from July 20th.
It is understood that the program will build a new class of all-age youth, and a group of talented teachers will be on the line to challenge the output of fun knowledge.
Unlike the serious impression of the group of teachers in the public, "Ding-Ding! Teacher's Good" brings together a group of intellectual representatives of the same value and talent.
They're both role models for young people from all disciplines or a bunch of people who shake their burdens and are good at the full-powerful "showers" that teach fun.
In the show, this excellent youth knowledge role model, as "knowledge-sharing officers", will challenge the fun knowledge class.
They need to show the most interesting side of the subject through attitude knowledge output.
And the "Question Group" of all-age viewers will ask a change of questions, and it makes it more difficult to teach the "knowledge-sharing officer" and add a little exciting atmosphere to the show.
It is revealed that this "knowledge-sharing officer" includes Li Yong Lok, a high school physics teacher attached to the Chinese People's University, and a senior young teacher with 10 years of experience, Wang Qing, who will show the audience the "hard core" knowledge of various disciplines in an unexpected way.
In addition, the show invited Professor Xue Mingfung of Economics as the "Know founder" of the "King-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting-Ting
Director of the Department of Government of the Hong Kong District of Hong Kong: The situation is serious, it's a serious situation, and it's a new network.
On July 26, Xinhua Hong Kong, Director of the Department of Government of Hong Kong, Zhang Jianzong, stated that the situation of the new coronary pneumonia outbreak in Hong Kong continued to be severe, and that if the epidemic turns, the HKSAR government will take more severe control measures to further limit the business of the premises and reduce public space.
But at this stage, the HKSAR government has not intended to introduce a home order or a "bargo order" to limit citizens from going out.
Zhang Jianzong published a web page on the day of the day, entitled "The situation is serious, and it's all over the disease."
He said that the outbreak was the worst in half a year, and that the next two weeks would be crucial to try to prevent the virus from spreading further in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the HKSAR Government, the self-regulation and cooperation of citizens are also very important.
He called on citizens to stay home as much as possible, reduce social contact and out-of-home meals.
Citizens should cooperate with the mandatory measures to wear masks to protect themselves and others and focus on personal and environmental hygiene and hand washing hands, and should suspend non-necessary meetings or dinners and reduce them to the streets.
He stated that the central centre had been very concerned about the change in the Hong Kong epidemic and supported the HKSAR Government's anti-disease prevention efforts and actively responded to the Chief Executive's latest request to assist in increasing detection capacity and the conversion of the Asian International Museum to assist in similar "class hospitals".
Zhang Jianzong stated that free virus testing provided by the District Government for specific high-risk groups, namely, the Angya House, the Disability House and the Conservation Hospital, restaurant employees, taxi drivers and property management staff had been fully conducted, involving up to 400,000 people.
He was very concerned about the cases of infection in the old house, and the District Government has arranged a specific temporary quarantine centre for his friends.
He said that the District Government was building quarantine facilities near the Pakura Bay Quarantine Centre in Grand Mount New Territories, which is expected to provide an additional 700 quarantine rooms by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on 19th that the District Government would build 2,000 more isolated houses at the Pakura Bay Quarantine Center and seek to be inaugurated by the end of this year.
Plus 800 of the quarantine centre, which has been put into operation, at the end of the year, a total of 3,500 quarantine rooms are expected to be available at the end of the year.
There are currently four operational quarantine centres in Hong Kong, providing approximately 2,600 quarantine rooms.
In addition, the HKSAR Government reopened the Carp Gate Park resort on Hong Kong Island as a community isolation facility for patients under 50 years of age who are self-care.
The history of the Party, the New China History Nutritional.
2020-07-26 17:37:29 Source: People ' s Forum Network by Zhu Yanjing Responsible Editor: Zhu Yanjing
Recently, General Secretary Xi, visited the Four Ping Memorial Museum, stressed that " more than 90 million members of the party, especially at all levels, have a good study of the history of the Communist Party of China, and the history of the new China ... "
Learning about party history, new Chinese history, is a mandatory lesson for party cadres, remembering their mission, learning from them, and taking a long journey of a new era.
A vast history of party, the history of the new China, documenting the hard work and the glorious journey of the Communist Party since its birth, shows the faith and loyalty of the Communists with life and blood, the first heart and mission that they will always hold.
History is the best textbook, and for party cadres, the history of the new China is the worst chapter in this textbook.
Every party member's cadre is constantly strengthening history-based, moving towards the future, on a new journey, a new journey, a "relay rod" of the times, and a long march for the present.
The spirit of history, learning the history of the party, the new Chinese history holds its first mission.
The history of the party, the history of the new China, is full of the eternal mission of the Communists of China and the belief of rock, showing the integrity of the Communists forever with the people.
Close learning about party history, important events in the history of New China, important meetings, important people, not only visual mind shock, thought baptism, but also understanding the meaning of the first faith in the soul, knowing the weight of the mission.
For party cadres, if you want to continue to do so, you must find the original point of our departure from the history of the party, the beginning of the new Chinese history, the beginning of the heart, to keep your clear understanding and firm position, to provoke the power to fight for the people of the nation, to ensure that the revolutions have passed on with blood and life.
Learn history, learn the history of the party, to pass on the noble spirit in the history of the new China.

But with the rapid advancement of industrialization, urbanization, the use of river and lake development and management imbalances, over-standard sewage, lake-building fields, the invasion of waters, etc., leading to black stench of water bodies, over-standard water quality, environmental dirtyness, ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is pushing for the ecological diversity of water, trying to pay back the Yellow River.
Water treatment must be taken from the source.
In Ningxia Sinchuan, the local approach of "marking + pollution + severe control" was used, and the municipal sewage treatment plant achieved all level A standard emissions, and the city built a zone of black stinks basically eliminated and successfully declared the third batch of China's black-sink water demonstration cities.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake long system in 2017, and now a system of responsibility for the five-grade river long river long-term system in the district and the county is now fully covered, and the river long cruise has become normal.

Birds, green trees, innways, water... the beauty of the sandgulls under the pen became a reality in the Yellow River Wetlands Park in Ningxia Silver River.
The yellow rivers, through Ningxia, have formed a variety of wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands, swamp wetlands, which are important for promoting rational use of water resources and the ecological balance of water, while becoming an important international channel for bird migration.
Since 2009, Ningxia-related sectors have accumulated funding for the Wetlands Protection Project, which currently covers 192 million hectares of wetlands and 78.5 per cent of wetlands, with natural lakes, swamp wetlands nearly 200, with 5 national wetlands parks, 1 national wetlands park, 6 autonomous district-level wetlands parks, 8 municipal parks.

"
Meanwhile, Ningxia has legally designated red lines between 500 metres of wetlands on both sides of the Yellow River Silver River section, which provides that no unit or individual shall develop and operate within the protection range except for public goods projects.
Zhao Xiaoyong, Deputy Director of the Water Service Centre in Silvergawa City, introduced that, through pollution source management, integrated management of river lake ecology and end-end wetlands, nine of Ningxia now have reached 100 per cent of the water quality of the yellow drain, "Now the water is clear, the fish are swimming and the flowers are open."

Ningxia Gincheon had a title: the only city in Yellow City that was "Standing the Yellow River."
Since 2010, the city of Ginchuan has been facing a continuing summer peak, and the "water shortage pain" has been a painful experience of many high-level residents of summer pain, but in all major water sources, the city's underground has formed a large area of groundwater super-crowding areas, and water scarcity has become a problem for the city of Silver River.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking the water of the Yellow River became a good way to solve the problem of drinking water for local residents.
Ding Ming, Deputy Director of the Water Department of Sinchuan City, introduced the water supply project on the western line of the city and rural areas of Singchuan City Circle in due course to replace the original groundwater source with quality yellow river water.
" On 29 December 2019, the water supply project officially reached three districts of Silver River City, and in 2020, residents of Guanning Town, Holand County also drank Yellow River water. "
Ding Ming said that the Singkawa Water Sector would take into account the transformation of regional rural water integration with urban water supply, " Next, we will integrate rural decentralized water points and access the West Line water project, which is expected to achieve almost integrated urban and rural water supply in the Silver River region by the end of this year.

Coco Sili's antelope into the return season - Xinhua Network
On July 25th, Xinhua News (Reporter Wang Kim) was informed from the five Liang protection stations of the Sanjiang National Park Administration, Coco Sili Management, Yangtze National Park, and that surveillance showed that the Tibetan antelopes who had previously travelled to the area of the Zorna Lake area of Cocosili were ending their births and began to return to their homeland with their children.
The surveillance footage near the five beam protection stations shows that on July 25, about 40 female hideaways led three hidden antelopes to 3002 km through the Green Road, and the five Leung North Bridges of the Green Railway, and the Tibetan antelope began to move back.
Experts have analysed that in recent years, the number of children who have returned to her herd has accounted for between one quarter and one fifth of the total number of herds.
The deputy researcher at the North-West Highland Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, also said: "In the early days of the relocation, the Tibetan antelopes are at high risk of arrest, so the number of young children in the flock will be less and even if there are no children. "
According to the Sanjiang National Park Authority, Coco Sili Management Service, the number of elopes has increased overall year by year, with an increase of 4860 in 2019, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Even Shinming said, "The return of antelopes is expected to end in early September, and the number of return to the antelopes is still expected to continue to increase."
The Tibetan antelopes protect animals at the national level.
At the end of May each year, antelopes from the three rivers of Qinghai, Tibet Tong, Xinjiang Alkin Mountain, etc. are headed to the lake of Dronan, located in the interior of Cocosili.
Wu Xiaomin, a researcher at the Animal Institute of the Province of Shaanxi (Ninxi Institute of endangered Animals), said: "The return of the her antelope is the process of returning to the habitat with her children after the end of the birth of antelope. The return group of children who initially left the birth of the child is large, but then hides the antelopes will return to their respective habitat according to different geographical populations. "
To ensure the safe return of the herds, journalists learned that the former Sanjiang National Park Authority, Coco Sili Management Service, Yangtze National Park, had arranged staff to continue video monitoring and district patrols in the main area of relocation.
If an antelopes are found to try to cross the road, the mountain patrolrs will conduct temporary traffic controls at the first time, allowing the sheep to pass through wildlife access safely to ensure that they are not disturbed by humans on their way back.
So, how do we get out of the heat in everyday life?
Experts suggest that summer out as much as possible to avoid the heat, and it is best not to walk or work in the sun before and after noon, because the sun is the strongest time period and the possibility of heat is higher.
If this is a time to go out, you must do protective work, like an umbrella, a suncap, a sunglasses, a conditional sunscreen, a sunscreen.
The clothes are as light as possible, air-friendly cotton, mahjong, silky, less fibre-optic clothing, so that a lot of sweating is not to heat up in time, causing heat.
When you're hot and hot, you have to prepare enough water, drink in time, don't wait for thirst to drink water, because once you feel thirsty means you're out of water, it's controlled at 150 ml to 200 ml, drinking warm water, don't drink ice water.
According to the temperature, the average person drinks 1.5 to 2 litres of water per day, high temperature operators, 3 to 5 litres of water per day.
When sweating more, you can fill some salt water to make up for the salt that the body loses because of sweat.
And, in the summer, the body is vulnerable to potassium, and it's a great summer drink with potassium tea.
Food and vegetables with high water levels in summer, such as raw vegetables, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc.; fresh fruit, such as peaches, almonds, watermelons, melons, can be used to supplement moisture; dairy products can be used to supplement both water and meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, the population working in a high temperature environment should properly supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium, etc.
Summer is short, hot, human metabolism is high, and it's expensive, and it's easy to get tired.
Adequate sleep can relax the brain and body systems, both work and learning and to prevent heat.
Experts say the best bedtime is from 2200 to 2300 hours, and the best time to get up from 5.30 to 6.30 hours.
Sleep well, don't lie under air conditioning vents and electric fans to avoid air conditioning and heat.
Experts suggest that people who operate outdoors or perform high temperature operations may carry 10 drops of water, man Dan, fragrance or fragrance positive gas pills, or placed in the near workplace, in order to prevent heat.
I hope you can spend some time thinking about a very simple fact that so far, most of our knowledge of the universe has come from light.
We stand on Earth looking up at the night sky and see the stars in the sky with our naked eyes.
The sun is so obscurant.
We can see the light that comes back from the moon.
Since Galileo has targeted his simple astronomical telescope at the object of the universe, and today, the universe we know, is before us through light.
With the help of the modern astronomical telescope, we have been able to collect a brilliant, silent space image -- a series of images that can be traced back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent play, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell you that the universe has its own pleasure, and the universe itself is playing, because space can think of drums as vibrating.
So when something big happens, it can make a series of voices to the universe.
Now, we want to be able to match this grand visual work on the universe with a voice.
Although we never heard a voice from outer space, we should be able to turn the volume up in the next few years and hear what happened there.
To capture the sound of the universe, this huge goal, we focus on black holes and the prospects it shows, because black holes can hit time and space, like drum hammers hit the drums, and I'm very happy to play some of the voices we predict.
One day we may see a shadow, a black hole that can leave a shadow in a very bright background, but it's not yet observed.
Although black holes can't be seen, they could be heard, because they hit time like drums.
The idea that the universe can sound like drums comes from Albert Einstein, and many of our ideas come from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe was empty, if the universe was empty, it would look like this picture, except for the support lines painted on it.
But if we fall freely in the universe, even without these support lines, our trajectory will draw these lines, because we will find us moving along the straight line, along the lines that don't bend through the universe.
Einstein also realized -- that's the most critical part -- if you put energy and matter in the universe, the universe bends. Free fall objects will be turned around the path that is turned through objects like the sun.
That's Einstein's great broad relativity.
Even the path of light will be bended.
When it turns to a certain extent, it turns around the orbit of the sun, like the Earth orbits around the sun, the moon orbits the Earth.
It's a natural curve in the universe.
But Einstein didn't realize that if you compress the sun into a ball of six kilometers in diameter -- that is, you compress the mass of the Earth into a ball of 6 km in diameter, and you're going to make a black hole, and the object is so dense that if the light is too close to it, it will not escape -- leaving a huge shadow in the universe.
But Einstein always thought black holes were just a mathematical wonder.
He doesn't believe there's a black hole.
He believes nature will stop the formation of black holes to protect us.
People started using the term "black hole" decades later and realized that black holes were real objects -- in fact, some of the stars of great mass, after catastrophic collapse at the end of their lives.
Our sun will not collapse into a black hole.
It's not really big enough.
But if we do some thought experiments -- Einstein loved it -- we could imagine crushing the sun within six kilometers, and then put a little Earth around its orbit, for example, 30 kilometers from the black hole sun.
The Earth will shine itself, because now the sun is gone, we don't have any other light source -- so our little planet has to shine on its own.
You'll find that you can even put the Earth in orbit 30 kilometers from the black hole and make it run happily in orbit.
This black hole is just as big as Manhattan.
Before it destroys the Earth, it could expand to Hudson Street.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object that was compressed to half the size of Manhattan.
So we moved this Earth close to the black hole -- 30 kilometers -- and we noticed it orbited the black hole along the perfect orbit.
There are rumors that black holes will devour everything in the universe, but you have to actually fall in very close.
But impressively, from our point of view, we can always see the Earth.
It can't hide behind the black hole.
The light from Earth, part of it fell into a black hole, but some of them were bending and we saw it.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the story of the Fort Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Our sun will not collapse into a black hole; it's not big enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them is eating up the galaxy, it'll look like this.
We'll see the shadow of a black hole throws hundreds of millions of stars in the galaxy and the dust belts that stars shine.
If we fall into this black hole, we'll see the light being refractioned around the black hole, and we don't even feel some huge changes happening when we start entering this shadow.
If we try to start the rocket and get out of there, it won't be good, because we can't run away, and even light can't escape.
Although black holes are dark from outside, it's not true in it, because all galaxies can fall into black holes with us.
And even so, because of the time expansion effect of relativity, our clock seems to be slower than the time of the galaxy, which looks like the galaxies outside are accelerating, just before we were destroyed by black holes.
It's like experiencing death, and you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a complete death experience.
You can't tell anyone you saw the light at the end of the tunnel.
So far, we've never seen a shadow of such a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they can't be seen.
Imagine, in a real astronomy scene -- imagine two black holes that have existed together for a long time.
Maybe they were stars and then collapsed into two black holes -- each of which was 10 times the mass of the sun.
Now we're compressing them within 60 kilometers.
They can rotate hundreds of times a second.
At the end of life, they approach each other at light speed.
In a few minutes, they can travel thousands of kilometers, and in the process, they not only bend space, but also cause a vibration of space in the tail flow behind them, a real time wave.
Black holes squeeze and stretch in space when they hit the universe.
These vibrations spread in space at light speed.
This computer simulation was done by NASA Goddard's relativity group.
It took almost 30 years to solve this problem.
This is one of the many teams.
It shows two black holes spinning around each other, and these are the imaginary curves.
As you can see -- it may be a little blurry -- you can see the red waves being fired, and these are gravity waves.
They are the voices of the real universe, which will spread from these black holes at light speed during the integration of black holes, until the two black holes are integrated into a quietly spinning black hole.
If you stand close enough, your ears will resonate with the squeeze and stretching of these spaces.
You can really hear these voices.
Of course, you'll be helpless to find your head squeezed and stretching, so you may not understand what happened.
But I'd like to play for you the sound of our predictions.
This is my team's research - a relatively brief calculation model.
Imagine a smaller black hole falling into a larger black hole.
The sound you heard came from a small mass black hole in collisions with space in the near the big mass black hole.
If they're far away, they'll sound very small.
But the sound became like a drum hammer, and it was beating space like a drum.
We can predict what this voice will become.
We know that in the fall, small mass black holes will get faster and louder.
Eventually, we'll hear the little black hole fall into a big black hole.
I never thought it was so loud - it was actually magnified here.
When I was listening at home, I felt a little bit of a bad voice.
Sounds like, Tinker Bell, Tinker Bell.
This is another sound we're doing.
I'm not here to show you images, because black holes don't leave any useful traces, and real space will not show you those virtual curves.
But if you hear that voice on vacation in the universe, I suggest you run.
Better get away from that voice.
Both black holes are moving.
Two black holes are approaching each other.
In this case, they're all shaking.
Then they'll be one.
That sharp voice is a sign of black hole integration - a sharp sound when the integration ends.
This is the prediction we'll see.
Fortunately, we're safe on Long Beach, California.
There's no doubt that two black holes somewhere in the universe have been integrated.
And there's no doubt that the space around us can feel these vibrations that travel through a million light years, or from a million years ago, they spread at light speed and eventually meet us.
But these voices are so small that we can't hear.
Some experiments in the world require a lot of effort to build -- one of which is called LIGO -- which detects spatial vibration of less than an atomic nuclear range every four km.
It's a very bold attempt, and its sensitivity will not be exceeded in the coming years -- it will be used to detect space vibration.
Another research project on the universe is expected to start in the next 10 years, called LISA.
LISA will see super-mass black holes -- millions or billions of times the mass of the sun.
We saw these two galaxies from the Hubble telescope.
Looks like they're still hugging together.
Their center may have a huge super-black hole.
But they're not still, they're actually integrating.
These two black holes will be collisiond, and their integration will experience billions of years.
So collecting their voices is beyond the limits of our human perception.
But LISA can see the final stages of two super-mass black holes that started to integrate a long time ago, 15 minutes before they were integrated.
This detection is not limited to black holes, it can also be used to detect any big interference in the universe -- the biggest of which is the Big Bang.
When the word was created, some mocked and said, "Oh, who would believe in the Big Bang?"
This animation short film, made by my friends at Proton Studios, shows the scene of watching the Big Bang from outside.
We would never really do that; we wanted to be inside the universe, because there was no such situation outside the universe.
So imagine you're in a big explosion.
The universe is everywhere, everything is surrounded by you, and space is swinging in an orderly manner.
14 billion years have passed, and that voice is still around us.
The galaxies are forming, a group of stars formed in galaxies... on a planet, at least one of these planets, suitable for life.
Here we're crazy about building experiments, doing calculations, writing computer codes.
Imagine, a billion years ago, two black holes crashed.
This voice has been traveling through the air all along.
We didn't even show up here.
It's getting closer - 40,000 years ago, we painted the walls of the cave.
If we're going to get the sound of the Big Bang, it sounds like this.
Technically, it's noise.
It's a white noise, a messy bell.
But it's everywhere around us, as long as it's not offset by some other process in the universe.
If we can detect these voices, it'll be like music for our ears, because this quiet echo comes from the moment we were created, from the universe we look forward to.
So in the next few years, we'll be able to raise the volume of these music a little bit, and let the universe show us in audio.
But if we can detect those earliest moments, it will also make us more aware of the Big Bang, so that we can ask some of the most difficult, and the most volatile questions.
If we play the universe backwards, we can know that there was a big explosion in the past, and we could even hear its loud voice, but our big explosion was the only big explosion in the universe?
I mean, we're gonna ask if there was a big explosion like that before that?
Will it happen again?
I'd say that if we raise the meaning of this question to the level that TED advocates, at least in this last minute, we can ask some questions that we may never answer.
But we can't help but ask, "Is our universe just a episode of a bigger history?"
Or, maybe we're just a branch of the multi-dimensional universe -- each of them has experienced its own big explosion -- maybe some of them have buzzed black holes, perhaps some of them, maybe some of them have conscious lives, perhaps some of them -- they don't belong to our past, nor are they in our future, but in some way we're connected?
So we can't help but guess if there's a multiverse, is there life in other branches of this diverse universe?
This is life in our diverse universe.
Is there any other life in the multiverse, and they're guessing our existence, thinking about their own origins?
If that's the case, I can imagine them, like us, to calculate, write computer codes, build experimental instruments, try to detect the weak voices that come from their origins, and doubt who else is there.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Graduate art fair moved into the mall public service exhibition - Xinhua Network
In the season of graduation from the university, a rare underline graduate art show began on the weekend.
But it is neither in the gallery nor on campus, but in public space in the city of Sunyang and open to the public free of charge until August 23rd.
Journalists learned that the 2020 graduate art exhibition called for 50/group works from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Chinese Media University and the Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts, which extends from 2 to 6 floors, and made full use of the interior lightbox for graphic works, maximize the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
In the event, the exhibition was particularly important.
Gopin, head of the city of Haoyang, said, "We choose to bring back to the cloud's graduation show and hope to show more people the youth's exploration and understanding of the world, magnizing the healing power of art for society and mind. "
She revealed that the work of the exhibition was collected for graduates of several art colleges and selected from them suitable for commercial space, in the form of painting from traditional racks, sculptures, to new media devices, interactive animations, VR panoramas, and the highest levels of body and enrichment.
Among them, Lee Yunshaw expressed his feelings in the first battle of 2020 through mechanical and manual mixed creative languages; Liu Ka-young explored the theme of "encrypted currency", "credit creation", "trade" in the first battle of 2020; and Zhang Jia-Chu Daqiang's "contained" was often accompanied by humans, and that young artists could see the understanding of human relationships by young artists; and the work of the Zhu fish, "The Winter of Faith" is a reminder to young people growing up, "When one day a career is done, remember that one day, it is simple and true."
Among the few graduates of the personal exhibition, Li Zhongxie from Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7, when I was a little worried about the epidemic, and I had a nuclear acid test three days ahead of schedule, with alcohol cotton and test reports. "
His work, "The Mystery of Yesterday", is complicated and must be self-inflicted.
And he's also on the task of helping his classmates fix their broken works.
"It's a little sad to show up until 4:30 a.m., then to fix it, and it's a little sad to have a picture of the work."
He wants to come to Beijing and see his work show with his classmates when the epidemic is more stable.

That morning, 65-year-old Bosonaro sent a picture on Twitter, in which he was wearing sneakers, without masks, sitting in front of a table with breakfast, smiled, one hand up thumb, and the other hand raised a box of hydrochlorine.
He tweets, "Good morning, everyone! The results of the new coronary virus test: negative."
But Bosonaro didn't show when the new coronary virus was tested.
On July 5, there was a new coronary pneumonia symptoms in Bosonaro, positive on 6th, and on 7th he claimed to have diagnosed new coronary pneumonia on TV.
On 14 and 21st, Bosonaro conducted two new coronary virus tests, and the results remain positive.
During the isolation, Bosonaro presented its hydrochlorine drug on several occasions via social media and stated that hydrochlorine was very effective for the treatment of new coronary pneumonia, which was well taken, thanks to the good health of the Brazilian medical facility for the treatment of new coronary pneumonia.
According to Brazilian media reports, to date, there are five cabinet ministers and 10 governors diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia.
A small plane crashed in the Swiss Alps, and all four people were killed.

According to official news from the CBA League, the CBA Qingdao area finally came to the first fans after the re-enactment.
The live viewing fans included people who moved Aoshima and doctors, teachers, public security personnel, etc. during the epidemic, and on July 31, the CBA after season was officially launched and will be officially re-opened for fans.
The CBA league began on June 20th, almost five months after the interruption.
Although there are few viewers to the 26th afternoon, the camp was clear: someone was applauding and someone was silent.
The players are on the field, and the fans are fighting the court, and this is a long time ago.
After the season, if the fans want to watch the game, you'll have to watch this.
The opening fan's ticketing contest is the Diamond Stadium of the Qingdao National Sports Center (Shangshan) and the sale of tickets is fully based on the online real name purchase system, and all viewers must be 12 years old or older and have 48 hours of kernel acid testing certification.
The prize is $50,000.
On July 26, Hubei Daily News (Reporter Lin Jing), the city of Ensch announced that the geological disaster site monitor, which made a significant contribution to the sand dam slide warning, Chen Liang, and sent him $50,000 in prizes.
At the same time, call on the city's cadres to learn his due diligence, to take responsibility, to take his initiative and to be willing to give up.
On July 21, the sand dam of the village of the Maman village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the city of Ensch led to the formation of the Qingjiang River River into Lake Tsai, 58 years old, Chen Liang, was the first person to warn the landslide.
On the afternoon of July 17th, Chen Liang learned that the villagers' walls broke and immediately arrived at the scene.
He just walked out of his home, and he saw the village road cracked four or five centimeters along the road to cornfield, about 50 meters long.
Chen Lightton was alert that the first photo of the road crack was sent to the country's Geological Disaster Monitor Contact.
The landslides are likely to be seen and judged by the relevant heads of the Tunburg Natural Planning Institute, and then the decision to evacuate the population.
Chen Liang's timely warning won 36 hours of precious time for the safe evacuation of 315 families in the area.
No one has been killed in this major geological disaster.
Chen Liang's responsible professionalism is praised by the public.
In the face of praise, he said, "There is no one who saved, it's my responsibility."
The University of Australia has developed new drugs that are expected to be used to treat the blood vessels caused by the new crown - Xinhua Network
Researchers at the University of Monash, Australia, on July 26th, are developing a new drug that helps prevent heart disease and strokes and hopes that it will be used to treat blood vessels caused by the new coronary virus.
Researchers have found that before a heart attack or stroke, an enzyme in the plate accelerates the condensation of the plate.
So they developed a drug that temporarily inhibits the coagulation of the plate, thereby avoiding blood vessels and preventing heart disease and strokes.
Researchers say that this drug only inhibits the condensation effect of the plate when heart disease or stroke signs occur.
Since studies have shown that similar blood vessels are one of the main causes of death among patients with new coronary diseases, researchers hope that this drug will be used for treatment of such severe patients in the future.
Currently, the drug has been effective in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next phase of human clinical trials.
The results of the study were published in the American magazine Science Conversion Medicine.
He became the first audience to enter after the CBA re-enactment allowed the audience to watch the game.
On that day, in the second phase of the Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) in the 2019-2020 season in Shandong Qingdao, medical personnel, teachers, public security fronts, through official ticketing platforms, entered the Shanghai Kuo-Sung East and West Kings after completing the process, including nucleic acid testing.
During the tour, the viewers must wear masks, enter the seat, keep them at a distance of one metre.
When they leave, the audience must leave the "one metre" social distance in order from the back, in the middle of the two sides.
Xinjiang Deep-Downing Sunflower Fields with Clean Energy - New Net

The news agency, Xinjiang, July 26th, has been working on the issue: Xinjiang Deep-Downing Sunflower Fields, using clean energy.
More than 6,000 five-sided solar mirrors, 48 square meters per block, one circle, like a silver "sunflower field", turns with the sun, reflecting sunlight to over 200 metres high in the center of the center of the heat tower, and power generation.
Reporter 25 saw this scene at the Hami Melting Salt Tower Photothermal Power Plant in the town of Ighu Lake, Igu County, Xinjiang.
"The so-called melted salt tower photothermal power generation is the central reflection of solar light through mirrors to the heat-suction tower, and then convert thermal energy into electricity through traditional power generation technologies ... "
Zhang Yong, Deputy General Manager of China-Hami Solar Thermal Power Company Ltd., described the design principles similar to the solar stoves used in rural areas of China, bringing together the sun.
The power plant began construction in October 2017 and was connected by the end of last year, covering 6,600 acres, and a total of 14,500 fixed-day mirrors were planned to be installed.
"The greatest advantage of traditional solar power generation technology is to store the concentrated heat and power generation at night ... "
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured by the project would keep the generator unit running continuously and not affected by light change; it could also be rapidly involved in the grid, depending on the needs of the grid's load valley.
When the project is fully completed, it will achieve annual electricity generation of more than 198 million degrees, saving more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reducing more than 60 tons of sulphur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxide, about 20 tons of dust and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, providing a continuous clean energy source.
Besides, there's another silver "Sunflower Field" in the Stone City Park in Hami City.
The Hamif Light Solar Photovoltaic Power Station, which covers over 2,300 acres, has also been built with the sun, maintaining the solar light and the spotlight face at 90 degrees straight.
" We use two-axis tracking polyphotoelectric power generation technology to maintain the efficiency of power generation from a high adjustment angle of the Sun through integrated control ... "
Monki, the station's chief, said that under the weather conditions of light, the power generation technology could increase the efficiency of about 20% more traditional photovoltaic power.
In the first half of this year, the power station has achieved more than 7 million degrees of electricity generation, which complements local electricity demand.
The Stone City Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest single body in Xinjiang, with the most complete photovoltaic industry demonstration park, with 38 units in photovoltaic power projects, with a total of 820,000 kilowatts.
The power generation was over 110 million degrees completed in the first half of this year, an increase of 6 per cent over the same period in 2019.
Hammy is one of the best areas in China's solar energy resources.

The American media have revealed the truth that the United States has unprovoked demands that China close the Consulate General in Houston.
2020-07-26 14:40:44 Source: Zong Vision Network by Zhu Yanjing Responsible Editor: Zhu Yanjing
The American media have revealed the truth about the unprovoked demand that China closes the Consulate General in Houston.
On 24 days, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the United States Embassy in China that China had decided to withdraw its permission to establish and operate the United States Consulate General in Chengdu and to make specific requests for the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities as a countermeasure against the sudden request of China to close the Consulate General in Houston on 21st day.
The United States government's act has raised many concerns and its political motivations have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why did China ask China to close the Consulate General?
Many foreign media claim that it is not clear why the United States will select the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, the media has stated that for the purpose of this move, it is clear that for the general election.
CNN reported on 23rd that the United States had asked China to close the Consulate General in Houston to raise questions about their political motivations.
According to the article, the United States government's catastrophic response to the new coronary epidemic has caused a lower poll support rate before the election by President Trump.
White House officials privately claim that the tough strategy against China was to save Trump's support rate and the responsibility to transfer the White House outbreak to failure.
The article states that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven, very cautious" target chosen by the United States, which is "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflicts".
BBC also believes that when the US economy is hit hard by the American election season, Trump thinks that "the game of Chinese cards" has a political advantage."
The current situation is "a spiral-up, sharp struggle", driven to some extent by the United States Government from a domestic perspective, which only exacerbates tensions between China and the United States.
The CBS reported that the prospects for re-election of Trump were under pressure by the outbreak, and that he repeatedly accused China of the epidemic.
The United States has almost every day new actions against what Trump calls "China exploitation of America".
"The Consulate General of Houston is important in establishing a connection between the two countries."
The Associated Press commented that the United States had asked China to close down the Consulate General in Houston to increase tensions between the two largest economies in the world.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic influence, Chinese citizens in southern the United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as are American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston regrets the request of the United States to close the Consulate General in Houston, claiming that the Consulate General played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural linkages between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of the Chinese economy.
The U.S. Foreign Policy magazine website believes that this American move is part of a series of provocation initiatives that only exacerbate relations between the United States and China."
Reuters quoted Jonathan Polak, an expert on East Asia, the United States think tank Brookings Society, saying that since the establishment of a comprehensive diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of anything compared to the United States operation against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning News reports that this American move has been unprecedented in foreign relations between China and the United States for over 40 years.
Analysts believe that this move could cause persistent damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was founded in 1979 as the first Consulate General in the United States.
Currently, China has an embassy and five Consulate Generals in the United States.

The speaker stressed that the Chinese Government was a strong guardian of cybersecurity and had always strongly opposed and fought any form of cyberattack and cybercrime.
According to the media, hacker organizations associated with China interfered with a British company network system and attacked British-American technology companies with patented data to invade the EU network.
The speaker said that the Chinese Government was a strong guardian of cybersecurity and had always strongly opposed and fought any form of cyberattack and cybercrime.
Cyberspace virtuality, trace difficulties, diversity of actors, and sufficient evidence should be produced in investigating and qualitative network events, and not unprovoked speculation.
According to the spokesman, a series of events such as the Prism Gate have proven that the United States has been conducting the largest cyber-smoke operation in the world.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace is in the common interest of all countries.
The speaker noted that China's achievements in science, technology and innovation were not stolen, not stolen, but through self-reliance and hard work.

Most areas of Urumqi free nucleic acid testing have been largely completed in high-risk areas for secondary testing - China New Network
On July 26th, the Director of the Urumqi City of Urumqi, the Director of the Urumqi City Health Commission, Zhang Wei, reported that most areas of the Urumqi free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi City are currently almost complete.
The State Council ' s expert group and autonomous region, Urumqi city experts are further assessing the development of the epidemic in accordance with the findings of nucleic acid testing and epidemiology.
The press office of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region held a press conference on 26th to inform the outbreak and control of Xinjiang.
According to him, from 00:00 to 2400 hours on 25 July, 22 new coronary pneumonia confirmed cases in Urumqi City (5 of which were referred to non-symmetric infections) and 38 new non-symmetric infections.
As at 2400 hours on 25 July, there were 135 confirmed cases in Urumqi and 147 cases without symptoms.
The new non-symmetric infections on 25th were basically tested through the city-wide free nucleic acid testing.
Zhang Wei, Director of the Urumqi City Health Commission, stated that most areas of the Urumqi free nucleic acid testing were largely completed.
He also said that, from other parts of the country, there were many factors affecting the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the detection of reagent sensitivity, the time of infection of the tested person and the time of detoxification, the collaboration of the tester at the time of the sample extraction (the difference of cooperation may result in the absence of the sample) and the detection environment, the operational proficiency of the tester.
For various reasons, nucleic acid tests also have false negative results.
The fake negative means that the person tested is actually infected, but the results of the nucleic acid test are negative.
In addition, for and confirmed cases, persons who have been in close contact with suspected cases usually require two nucleic acid tests to be excluded.
For people who have been to high-risk areas in the epidemic, if heat and respiratory symptoms occur, there is a possibility of false negativeity for a nucleic acid test, so two nuclear acid tests are required to be excluded.
He said that, in view of the above, for the health of the population of the city, from today on, Urumqi will conduct a second free nucleic acid test in priority areas such as Tianshan, Shaibak district, while conducting "recovering leaks".
According to the information received, the Shaibak district is a high-risk area in Tianshan.

The US-China Trade Representative, meeting in August.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quotes an anonymous source of information that the Chinese trade negotiating team, Deputy Prime Minister Liu Tsuru of the State Council and the United States team co-leader, the trade representative, La Hae Cheol, is expected to hold an official meeting in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States.
According to reports, while China has significantly increased its number of American agricultural products over the past few months, China’s procurement remains a distance from the number promised in the trade agreement due to factors such as the new coronary virus epidemic.
Analysts say that the recent closure of the Consulates between the United States and China, plus other disputes, could undermine any progress in trade between the parties.
The first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States entered into force one month after the signing of 15 January, which provides for a high-level trade framework group of the two parties to hold meetings every six months.
According to sources, this meeting will be an important turning point, allowing both parties to assess the progress of the agreement.

Since this year, relations between China and the United States have deteriorated rapidly, including a series of issues such as the origins of the new coronary virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
President Trump, while bragging about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, has changed its attitude recently.
He said at the White House press conference that while China has recently purchased American corn in a record number of soybeans, "but this trade agreement is not as good as it was when it was reached."
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also believes that a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely to take place due to poor relations between the United States and China, "Trade issues have lost weight in Central American relations".
But he revealed that China's economic and trade-related units still met on 23rd, and discussed a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "We've done our best to buy, so any additional procurement will be difficult."
Peng Jeenning, Vice President of the National Commission for Trade in the United States and China, said that maintaining the first stage of the agreement was "more important than ever" and that China had made progress in further opening up financial markets to United States companies this year.
The independent research company Plenum analyst said, "It's better to talk than not to talk, although it's probably only a routine."

Economic Watch, journalist Zhang Bin, because of the coffee fake incident, the U.S. market has imposed more severe regulation of China stock, plus long-term pressure on valuation, pressure on the general stock supply of shares listed in the United States, Internet, Kyodong, etc., recently opened a journey back to Hong Kong.
And recently, shells, ideal cars, and so on, went to the United States to be on the market.
Is it the best time for Chinese companies to go to the United States under the epidemic and the crisis?
"In the recent IPO case and the next company to be listed in the United States, IPO is not essentially affected, but the market is now very good, even now the best time point for Chinese companies to travel to the United States for the last 10 years. "
Hao Xin, Chief Representative of the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, said at the "General Stock Exchange 2020 Summit of Listed Companies Leaders" sponsored by Snowball.
In April this year, the SEC and the United States Public Corporate Accounting Regulatory Board (PCAOB) issued a statement on the important role of audit quality and regulatory access to audit and regulatory access to audit and other international information — a challenge discussion on current access to United States listed companies with a large number of operations in China".
The statement states that, while international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, United States regulators still have problems with access to information, and that SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; in contrast to the document, the PCAOB website details the list of listed listed listed companies with audit barriers and their audit agencies, with a large number of medium-sized equity companies.
In addition, in May this year, the Senate of the United States Congress passed the Foreign Corporate Accountability Act, which provides additional disclosure requirements for foreign companies to be listed in the United States.
In the view of Hao-seong, the Chinese stock crisis does not affect the appetite of investors.
"This news just came out of a panic, and everyone asked if they could go to the United States in the future, but then we found out that it wasn't a problem with investors, and investors might ask these questions when they were on the road show to the United States, but it was not considered an important factor for investors to invest in a Chinese company.
It is recommended that you look at the situation as usual as possible.
Of course, this is probably the worst case in the last two years, but it's not affected by the appetite of investors.
So the boom to the IPO will continue from now until the end of this year or before the U.S. election. "
On May 9, this year, Kim Shan Yun was officially listed in NASDAQ, the first Chinese company to go to the United States of America after the outbreak.
"The listing of Kim Shan Yun has great confidence in Chinese companies that prepare IPOs. "
Hao-seong says.
The mid-term stock data report released by snowball shows that 20 IPO Chinese enterprises in the first half of this year, an increase of 17.6 per cent over the same period last year; 20 enterprises raised by 27.25 billion, an increase of over 52.4 per cent over the same period last year;
According to Hao Xing, Chinese companies who travel to IPO in the first half of this year are of high quality, with hard basic and growing high-quality companies that will be more popular with investors.
In the short, medium term, in the long run, Hao Xing continues to be optimistic about Ming China's IPO.
"The short-term wave of IPO is still going on; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more options, A shares, Hong Kong shares, United States shares, and you will use US elections and Central American relations as a consideration of market choices and time choices; in the long run, all market fluctuations are cycles, both political cycles and economic cycles, and eventually back to normal stages, and stock markets have always been ahead of fluctuations. "
Hao Xing also said, "This year's uncertainty is more uncertain, but for high-quality companies, whether the market is good and bad, as long as they are solid and the growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively secondary, and investors need to invest in good Chinese companies. "

People ' s Daily Reviewer: Focus on doing their own business, building new advantages for future development – learning to follow up on the important speech of Secretary Xi at the Entrepreneurs Symposium - Xinhua Network
Xinhua, Beijing, July 25th, People's Daily, July 26th, commentator article: Focus on your own business, build new advantages for future development.
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation remain complex and the challenges facing our development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic strength, enhancing confidence and focusing on doing our own business is key to our response to risk challenges.
At the recent Entrepreneurs Symposium, General Secretary Xi stressed that in the current protectionism, the world economy is depressed, the global market is shrinking, the global market shrinks, we must focus on doing our own business, to fully realize the domestic super-large market advantage, to gradually develop a new development landscape that is mutually reinforcing by the domestic cycle, the domestic and international cycles, the upgrading of industrial chain supply chains, and to promote science and technology innovation, accelerate key core technological attacks and build new advantages for future development.
The wise, the master wins.
In the external environment of economic globalization, markets and resources "outside" play an important role in the rapid development of our country.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more instability uncertainty, and economic globalization is experiencing a reverse wind and a return wave.
To prepare and work to respond to external environmental change for a longer time, to drive our economy to take a steady and far way, one of the most important aspects is to use expanding and meeting domestic demand as a strategic basis for development, to fully realize its strengths and to boost the economic development of the country through a prosperous domestic economy and to drive the world economic recovery.
We must be deeply aware of the construction of a complete system of internal demand, which is related to our long-term development and long-term governance.
The party's central review, which clearly sets out the firm implementation of the strategy for expanding domestic demand, is the need to respond to the impact of the epidemic, the need to maintain the long-term and healthy development of our economy and to meet the growing needs of people's growing and better lives.
The advantage of a large economy is internal circulatory.
Our country has the most complete and largest industrial system in the world, a strong productive capacity, a well-developed capacity, with more than 100 million market subjects and over 170 million people with higher education or professional skills, and a super-large domestic demand market created by 1.4 billion people, including over 400 million middle-income groups, in new industrialization, information, urbanization, rapid development of agriculture, and investment demand potential.
Public ownership is the main, multi-owned economy development, distribution by labour, multi-distribution, social fundamental economic systems such as socialist market economic systems, which can stimulate the vitality of various market subjects, free and develop social productivity, and promote efficiency and equitable organic unity and achieve common wealth.
We need to firmly seize the strategic basis for expanding internal needs, bringing production, distribution, circulation to achieve a positive cycle of domestic markets, to clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reforms and promote dynamic balance of total supply and total demand at higher levels.
To accelerate the construction of a complete system of internal demand, to promote science, technology and innovation and other innovations, to accelerate strategic emerging industries such as the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life health, new materials, to create more new growth points, growth poles, and gradually to develop new development patterns that are dominated by a large domestic cycle, both domestic and international cycles.
Openness brings progress, closures are bound to lag behind.
General Secretary Xi has repeatedly stressed that China's open door will not close, but only the bigger.
The main focus of the domestic cycle is not closing the door to close the door, but rather to make domestic markets and international markets better connected to domestic and international markets, and to make better use of two markets in the international and domestic markets, two resources to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, expanding domestic demand and expanding openness is not contradictory, the smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to build a new pattern of openness and to create new advantages for participation in international cooperation and competition.
While international protectionism is now rising, we are on the right side of history, insisting on deepening reforms, expanding openness, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting an open world economy and promoting a community of human destiny.
The Chinese nation has experienced a lot of suffering in history, but has never been crushed, but the more frustrated, growing up in the suffering.
On the way forward, there are strong leaders in the center of the party, with a prominent advantage of the Chinese-specific socialist system, with strong mobilization and strong combined power, with the solidarity of all the people of the entire army, and we must be able to overcome all difficult and difficult obstacles, maintain the momentum of our economic and social well-developed, fully building a small society, and successfully opening a new journey to build a modern socialist nation!
The balance is "90 after" instead of revenge?
As the balance returns go down, "90 years later" not only did he escape the balance, but started saving money?
The report of the 90-year-old balance after the Chinese New Economic Research Institute jointly paid the treasure (version 2020) showed that in the first half of the year, 90 years later, the savings were more than 40% higher than in 2019.
Interestingly, "after 90" prefers to save from a "small money" with 60% of the average savings below $20 per sum...
Save money with the balance, and it's a "after 90" money-saving habit.
Data show that of the 700 million balance users, 134 million users are after 90.
China has 174 million after 90, which means that about three out of every four "90s" in the country are saving money with a balance.
Currently, the 7-day annualized rate of return for IMFs such as balance has declined from above 2 per cent at the beginning of the year to about 1.5 per cent.
Even so, it doesn't affect the pace of saving money after 90.
And in the context of the increase in the balance-saving effect, many young people who are used to using balance treasures are also directly transformed into "Kimmin".
The payment data show that as of July 13, the new "kimin" on the treasure has increased more than onefold over the same year, and more and more young people are making "step" finance on the payment treasure.
Analysts believe that the flow of funds from balance to the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in IMF share in June.
The report also shows that "after 90" girls prefer to save more money, on average, 20% higher than boys; 60% of users holding funds on payment platforms are men, women tend to choose a more robust way of financial management than men.
What's the plan after 90?
Paying the treasure data shows that after 90 has a habit of saving money, using travel as the most users to save money.
Many after 90 years of saving money to prepare for post-disease travel; cinemas are back in business and provide new ways to move from saving money to consumption.

France has increased space military inputs - Xinhua Network
French Defense Minister Florence Pali said on 24th day that France would add hundreds of millions of euros in space defence budget to develop space military forces to prevent possible "unfriendly moves " by other countries in outer space.
Pali told Provence that between 2019 and 2025, the French space military project expenditure budget would increase from the previously proposed Euro3.6 billion (approximately $4.2 billion) to Euro4.3 billion ($5 billion).
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update existing observation satellites and communications satellites, launching three electromagnetic intercept satellites to increase the modernization of space surveillance radars.
French President Emmanuel Marlon announced last July that the French Air Force would establish a space military command and "air and space force".
Pali said she would officially announce the establishment of the space force when she visited a military school in Salon, Provence.
Pali said the space force was part of the Air Force, which reached 500 by 2025.
She said, "It was thought that space was used to serve the common interests of science, and that idea was gone... and now space is a place for nations to fight for global hegemony."
Pali reiterated Marklon's previous statement that the French side had not intended to provoke an arms race.
"We are not in an arms race... but I have a responsibility to fully understand the threats we may face. "
Pali again mentioned that a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017 was watched.
She said, "Peeping" is a Russian satellite.
The Russians deny that.
Pali said France would soon have a small patrol satellite that could detect and lock "the black hands behind unfriendly moves."
The French media believe that France seeks to establish a space force because President Donald Trump asked the United States Department of Defense to draft the Space Army bill last February.
Trump signed the Defence Authorization Act last December to approve the establishment of the sixth largest United States Army, the Space Force.
Some experts are concerned that these American initiatives have accelerated the militarization of space in the United States and could trigger a new round of space arms race.

It is understood that the three canyon tunnels are not only the longest high iron tunnels in the three canyons, but also the projects currently under construction in the country, with a maximum single-hole double-line high iron tunnel designed at 350 km/hour per hour.
Zheng Wan Gao Iron, located in Henan, Hubei, Chongqing, in the city of Chongqing, Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, arrived in Chongqing in the city of Zhengzhou, and arrived in Chongqing.
Zheng Mangang Iron Three Gorge tunnel is full on 26th.
It's a cross-site.
Zheng Wan Gao Iron, which began in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, heading south-west through Pingtop Hill, Nanyang City, Hubei Province to Manzhou District, Hubei Province, with a new route of approximately 818 km long, designed at 350 km/hour, and about 184 km in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou-Yang section was operational in advance on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is increasing its construction.
On 26th, the three canyon tunnels that are all connected are the Zheng Wan Gao Iron Line Control Project, which is located at the border between Bong Zhongqing County and Vooshan County, which is about 18.9 km long, with a maximum of 890 metres deep.
The tunnel began construction in February 2017 and was fully connected on July 26, 2020.
According to the Royal Army of the design of the design of the Chinese Central Iron II Engineering Group, the Royal Army of Zheng Wangai Tunnel, the site of the three canyon tunnels is complex, facing risks such as rock solubility, mud surges, soft rock transformations, high-risk tunnel I, and tunnel design and construction are extremely difficult.
"In the construction of the project, we have introduced a special design programme for more than 30 types of soluble holes, such as geological survey, material detection and super-pre-drilling methods. For example, a bridge of 24 metres long, across the tunnel, a large cave of more than 55 metres deep, avoiding the sinking of tunnels ... " The Royal Army says.
According to the construction of the Central Iron Tunnel Authority, the tunnel was built in a way that was guided by the construction of a cross-hole flat, slurry blocked water, reinforced tunnel structure support and the construction of sewage treatment stations, both in orderly progress of the project and avoided damage to the water bodies of the three canyon landscape, while successfully overcome the poor geology such as 7 km of soft rock deformation, with a maximum surge of 157,000 cubic metres per day, with a maximum surge of 157,000 cubic metres per day.
The construction of the entire line of Zheng Wango iron will be the new easy and fast passenger main route in the south-west region of the south-west region to improve the capacity and quality of the north-east to the south-west, improve the layout of the regional network, accelerate the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the line, promote regional coordination and promote regional coordination and the implementation of the Western development strategy.
Experts say immigration information is collected through the United States census for unconstitutional distribution of seats in the House.
Some civil rights organizations and several U.S. cities and counties sued the United States federal government, claiming that the Trump Presidential Palace was trying to exclude unauthorized immigrants from the United States census and unconstitutional.
The United States census will determine the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives of the United States Congress.
Sarah Brannon, executive lawyer of the American Civil Rights Freedom Union, said to the voice of the United States, "It's not gonna work."
She went on to say that it was difficult for Trump to identify the citizenship of the person who was under the census and that it was "not reliable."
Another civil freedom organization co-business organization filed a lawsuit on Thursday to challenge the Executive Order of Trump.
In New Jersey, some cities in Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit on Friday.
Garvey, Chairman of the Board of Management of Arlington County, said, "The American Constitution requires an accurate inventory of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone living in Arlington County, and cannot allow this illegal attempt to scare people and compress the number of our immigrant communities. "
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
According to Marshall, Minister of Justice of Alabama, the executive order was a victory in the state.
He said, "When assigned seats in the House of Representatives and electoral groups in the states, it must be based on the number of inhabitants living in the states and the number of legally resident residents. "
The U.S. Supreme Court prevented the Trump administration from integrating citizenship into the 2020 census form.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week to regulate data from the United States Census Bureau's business minister Ross to submit data from the census so that the administration could exclude these unauthorized populations from the state census figures and thus determine whether each state increased or reduced or maintained seats in the House of Representatives.
The United States re-allocations the House of Representatives seats every 10 years based on demographic changes.

Let's move forward with the construction of industrial projects - nod headlines - Hunan Daily News Network - China Voice Online
The summer Hunan, the hot waves.
And the enthusiasm released by the construction of industrial projects in the province has advanced the live viewing, and has covered the heat of the three-volt heat, "In industry-to-power, with project-based heroes" to inspire three water.
Hunan's development is always based on projects, training industries.
In the first half of the year, under the strong leadership of Comrade Xi, the whole province insisted on a game to prevent the disease, to prevent the disease, to prevent two hard wars, to use industrial projects as "six steady" "six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-S-S-Six-Six-S-S-Six-Six-Six-S-S-S-S-F-O-F-F-F-F-F-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-S-S-S-S"
From a 1.9% decline in GDP in the first quarter to 1.3% in the first half of the year, during which it was difficult, hard to work, and it was self-evident.
On this precious report card, industrial project construction is the key support of Hunan accelerating economic recovery and stable development.
It's a good thing, it's irreversible.
Industrial project construction, to be put in the big picture, to build up, to build, to be good at change, to change, to change.
In the context of the complexity of the current international situation, in addition to the hard-working recruitment, there is a need to study the new features of the current new situation, to be more disciplined, more scientific and accurate and more integrated into the new development patterns that have been promoted by the domestic and international cycles.
More focus on upgrading industrial infrastructure.
In the first half of the year, we not only started a large number of new industrial heavy-weight investment projects, but also the hope that more traditional dominant industrial enterprises accelerated the layout of digital, intelligent, green industrial transformation, and falling.
The Yiyang Oscon III Science Park Project has adapted existing production lines, with high-end printing circuit boards intelligent production lines ahead of the first; the new plant of the smoke-smoke factory in Hunan is dedicated to intelligent transformation, the construction of modern plants, and is a vivid picture of the "old tree new sprouts" ... around the major national strategies and "two new priorities", focusing on the promotion of the dominant industry, actively developing new industries, increasing technological innovation and alternative capacity to continuously build basic conditions and build up transformational energy.
More focus on developing new models of new business developments in the development of new economies.
The sudden new coronary epidemic, which brought about the redness of the cloud economy, has inspired the potential of the digital economy to provide new opportunities for industrial change: in the first half of the year, our computer and office equipment manufacturing industry grew by 12.6 per cent, and the online retail sales of wholesale retail enterprises above the limit increased by 32.2 per cent over the same period, and 35.6 per cent more than the same year.
New opportunities in crisis, new opportunities in change, actively promoting digital industrialization, industrial digitization, leading the digital economy and real economic integration are the trend.
Greater focus on optimizing and stabilization of industrial chain supply chains.
Engineering machinery is the main force of the Hunan industry, but two thirds of the associated enterprises are outside the province, and there is still room and potential on the support chain.
Strengthening the industrial chain thinking project, which requires not only the continued accumulation of head enterprises, but also to achieve technological breakthroughs at the critical link of the industrial chain; it also needs to be developed everywhere to stimulate the chain chain to stimulate the chain of chains, to promote a coordinated layout of the associated supporting industries, to accelerate the construction of autonomous and secure industrial chain supply chains.
It's a big deal. Hunan is still a good business environment, a hot land, a market business opportunity.
The "accelerator" of high-quality development of the company's hardship, the "convenient" of high-quality development in the province; the "conventory" service, the policy is not a discount, the problem is solved at night... in the course of the loss caused by the epidemic, the "thousands of the plan" to find the short plate pain, and the success of the life stories of the opportunity.
A mind-in-the-art industry, growing industry, developing industries, solid and solidly optimizing the business environment, and it will win the favor of more investors.
The wind is still ahead, but the state of wind breaking the wave has become the construction of industrial projects in the province and down to promote high-quality development.
In this critical period, learning must be done to follow up on the spirit of the important instructions of the General Secretary-General Xi to respond effectively to external uncertainty with the certainty of his own work, to promote industrial projects, to promote industrial projects, to sweat together, ensure that the 13th and complete construction of the Xiaokang society are successfully completed.

Employment and prices are generally stable and show that the economy has a temperature.
Economic Daily News, China Economic Network journalist, Lin Fire
In the first half of this year, in the face of the new coronary pneumonia outbreak, our country integrated efforts to advance the epidemic control and economic and social development, the epidemic control situation was constantly improving, with a clear economic recovery, with employment and price performance closely related to life, and the Chinese economy handed over a hot economic operating report card.
In the first two months of this year, unemployment rates rose.
In particular, many enterprises were largely cut off in production operations, reduced demand for business workers, delayed recruitment or cancellation, and urban surveys had increased unemployment rates.
As the epidemic's control situation gradually improves, the entire social production order continues to recover.
The party centre insists on the overall tone of a steady move to work, further strengthen macro-policy, comprehensively strengthen employment priority policies and actively promote a steady expansion of employment.
Our policy has increased policy to stabilize jobs, to give a "rehabilitation" policy mix, phased relief to three social insurance units, allowing the extension of social insurance fees, expanding unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises to return their jobs, benefit from the work-based training policy, to subsidize the employment of priority groups, internship subsidies, etc.
As steady employment policies are implemented, business demand has steadily recovered, employment situation has gradually improved, urban surveys have gradually declined, with unemployment rates in June, with a survey of 5.7 per cent.
Zhang Yi, Director of the Department of Population and Employment Statistics, National Statistical Office, said that employment policies continued to work in the second quarter, with the return of labour out of the previous period due to the impact of the epidemic, an increase of about 10 percentage points in June, close to the same period last year.
Data show that total urban employment increased by more than 19 per cent in June, with most industries reaching pre-disease levels; average working hours per week for enterprises were 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than in February, slightly 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Prices are also related to thousands of families.
In January this year, the CPI increased by 5.4 per cent over the same year, and it was a new height for years.
In February, the CPI increased slightly, but it was still in the 5th zone.
The CPI increase is high over the same period, with pre-spring consumption demand pull factors and lower than the same base.
However, the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly evident.
With epidemic control, logistics delays occurred throughout the country in January, in late supply of goods and increased cost of transportation of goods, etc., and some citizens hoarded purchases, and some of the essentials for life rose significantly.

As an artist, contact is very important to me.
I try to explain through my art that humans are not separated from nature, but everything is connected.
I first went to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw the iceberg for the first time.
I'm afraid.
My heart bangs fast, dizzy, trying to understand what this is in front of me.
I can only feel strange that a snowflake covers another snowflake, which is formed year after year.
The iceberg is formed when they break from glaciers or break from the ice shelf.
Every iceberg has their own unique personality.
They interact with their surroundings and their circumstances in a clear way.
Some icebergs refuse to compromise and stick to the end, and others can't stand falling apart under a violent passion.
When you see icebergs, it's easy to think that they're isolated, they're independent, alone, more like our humans sometimes think of themselves.
But reality is far more than that.
As the iceberg melts, I breathe to its old smell.
As the iceberg melts, it releases fresh water rich in minerals and they feed everything.
I started filming these icebergs, like I was filming portraits of my ancestors, and I learned that at these individual moments, the icebergs existed in that way, but never existed like that again.
When they melt, it's not death; it's not an end, but a continuation of the path to life.
I've filmed icebergs, some ice very young -- thousands of years old.
Some ice is over 100,000 years.
The last picture I want to show you is an iceberg I took on Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
It's a very rare opportunity that you can actually see an iceberg roll.
So that's what the figure shows.
You can see a boat on the left.
It's a boat about 15 feet.
I want you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg, its transformation on the surface.
Here you see it starting to roll, the boat moves to the other side, a man standing there.
It's an average size of Greenland iceberg.
It floats about 120 feet high or 40 meters high.
This video was taken in real time.
Like this iceberg, they show you different aspects of their personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)

The film "The Jedi Strike" is driven by Thailand as the main scenario, using Thai boxing as the beginning of the dream of the fall champion Venus, the whole story was adapted to traditional Chinese cultural values, whether it was the determination of Venus to set false fists for masters or to re-energize as dignity with the support of friends and lovers, showing the pursuit and love of men in Chinese traditional culture for families and dreams.
Together with the classic Hollywood sports film story model and the strong team of the Chinese-Thai professional team, the Jedi strike is not only internationalized, but also moves different types of viewers.
Meanwhile, Jedi strike shows a lot of Thai boxing and training stories, intense and hot blood.
In the film, Zhang Xiao Liang, a game designer played by Dong Woo, helped to return to the ring by Liao William and took off the crown, combining the new and interesting high-tech with hot blood competitions, and showed Zhang Xiao Liang and Venus seemed different, and the same goal was a brother.
Moreover, the long-flowing love between Venus and Crystal is very touching, and the silent support of Venus and Venus' firm commitment to the crystal, has shown the audience of the Iron Man's tenderness on Venus, and has added many feelings to the late champion.

Greenfield has launched a new mix of changes to Shanghai State to transfer 17.5 per cent of its shares - Economic Watch Network - Professional Financial News website
On July 26, Green Land Holdings (600606.SH) issued a hint announcement on the intention of State shareholders to transfer part of the company's shares and duplicates through public call for concessions.
The announcement shows that, in order to further deepen the reform of State-owned enterprises, optimize the restructuring of national capital, improve the green land equity structure, Shanghai Property (Group) Ltd. (hereinafter "Shanghai Property") and Shanghai City Investment (hereinafter referred to as Shanghai City Investment) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai City Investment") are intended to transfer part of the shares held through public call for concessions, and the share to be transferred does not exceed 17.5 per cent of the total green land equity.
The price of the shares to be transferred is not lower than the higher: the average of the daily weighted average price per day for the 30 trading days of the tip announcement (27 July 2020); the value of net assets per share audited by the company in the last accounting year.
Currently, there is still no conclusion about the new strategic investors in the greenfield, and according to the bulletin, the new strategic investors are going to take 17.5 per cent of the shares transferred in this mix of greenfields require approximately $14 billion.
It is worth noting that after the transfer of shares is completed, the greenfield is expected to remain unheld shareholders and actual controllers, but there may be a significant change in the control structure.
Since its inception, Green Land Holdings have undertaken several institutional institutional reforms: in 1992-1997, operating under market-based rules under pure State-owned systems; and in 1997-2013, the establishment and continuous improvement of State ownership, employee shareholding; and from 2013-2015, strategic investors were introduced to form a mixed ownership of State-owned and non-public capital, integrated ownership; and from 2015 to date, the public company was introduced.
The current mix of greenfields is similar to the Gwig, and in December 2019, the capital leader of the high-level capital was replaced by 15 per cent of the shares of the Gwig Electric (000651.SZ), and the Gly Group withdrew from small shareholders, and after completing the mix, the Gwi Electrics implemented modern business management schemes such as the executive incentive scheme, the lack of real control structure.
Shanghai Real Estate, Shanghai City, is a fully owned State-owned enterprise group of Shanghai City, Chairman of Greenfield Holdings, President Zhang Yu Liang, stated that the Greenfield was an important initiative to advance the comprehensive reform of state-owned enterprises, as required by the party, to accelerate the reform of the new phase of state-owned state enterprises, which fully demonstrated the new thinking of reform due to local and quantitative clothing, supporting enterprises to further improve marketization, increase business management freedom and accelerate the full release of reform energy by introducing new and well-established strategic shareholders to listed companies.
The first trip across the country to travel across the province - Xinhua Network
On July 25, at 1220 hours on 25 July, Xinhua Society, more than 200 Shanghai tourists on D771 vehicles arrived in Lanbrook, Zhejiang Province, and the first cross-saving car tour in the country since the Ministry of Culture and Tourism resumed the cross-district (district, city) team tour on July 14.
The land is located in Lanbrook, Midwest of Zhejiang, with a lot of winning sites, including Zhuge village, underground river, Chi-chungu village, and in two days and one night, more than 200 Shanghai tourists will take a look at these sites.
Li Li Li, Deputy General Manager of Shanghai Railways International Tourism (Group) Ltd., according to the latest policy, was closely targeted at the needs of the province, in contact with Lanbrook, and carefully launched the Shanghai to Lanbrook and Summer Reward 2 Days, which were sold out in less than a week.
Aunt Sun from Shanghai said she never left this year because of the epidemic.
"It's been a long time at home, sharing the information with friends as soon as I see a team trip, and I've never been to Lanbrook before, looking forward to this trip." Aunt Sun said.
It is understood that in September last year, Lanbrook City signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Ltd., which plans to open 12 high-level iron tourism to Lan Creek within a year.
I hit myself?
The White House consultant, "Rebelt" states, are back early - China New Net.
It's too early for the White House consultant to the states to get back to work.
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30 per cent of the world.
For months, US President Trump has repeatedly asked the states to resume their studies until recently, to change their attitude and take the initiative to wear masks in public, and his consultant called some state governments too early.
On 22nd, the White House presidential adviser, Karen Conway, stated at a press conference that some state governments had failed to comply with the standards of re-entry and had been restarting bars and places like that.
Conway also mentioned that it was a false rumor that the President had "absolute power" to decide on the re-entry of the states.
"The president is a federalist, and he believes that the states have autonomy. "
She argued for Trump.
However, the rumor in Conway's mouth was told by Trump at the White House outbreak on April 13th.
The operation of self-smuggling is mocked by the Internet as "rewriting history".
Karen Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump claims that the Governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, was a dictator because she followed the medical guidelines and insisted on stopping.
Trump wants to get back to work so he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time that Karen Conway has been controversial.
On April 15, Conway, in an interview with Fox News, came out of his mouth: "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, my friends!"
She seems to have understood "19" as a version number, and the netizens are crazy: read the papers without common sense!
Recently, we've seen the impact of cyber attacks on the business world.
Data leaks from companies like Morgan Chase, Yahoo, Home and Tagit department stores, causing hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions of dollars.
A few more attacks like this, and the whole world economy will collapse.
The public domain is not spared.
From 2012 to 2014, the American Office of Management had a very serious data leak.
Security clearance and fingerprint information were stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
You may also hear that some government-funded hackers, trying to use stolen data to influence the results of the election in some countries.
Two recent cases, one was the massive theft of data from the German House of Representatives, one of which was stolen by the National Council of the Democratic Party of the United States.
The cyber threat has affected our democratic process.
And there's a growing trend.
The more computer technology is developed, the more vulnerable we use to protect data.
Especially a new computer technology called quantum computers, which uses microparticles in nature to significantly increase computer computing.
It's so powerful that it can crack many encryption systems we use today.
So, are we hopeless?
Should we start packing up electronic survival equipment to meet the coming end of the data?
I don't think that's it yet.
Quantum computers are only in laboratories, and it takes years to use it.
More importantly, there have been many major breakthroughs in the encryption field.
For me, this is a very exciting time in the history of security communications.
About 15 years ago, I learned that we unlocked new skills that could create quantum effects that were not present in nature.
Using the basic laws of physics to advance the development of encryption technology, this idea has made me so excited.
Today, some selected companies and laboratories, including me, have advanced this technology to the stage of practical application.
That's right.
We're going to use quantum to fight quantum.
How do we do that?
First, let's get to know the world of encryption.
You need a briefcase, and you have some important documents for your best friend, James Bond, to lock it up and keep it safe.
Because these materials are top secret, we're going to use a super-advanced briefcase.
It has a special password lock, and once locked, it converts the contents of the file to random numbers.
So you just put the file in, lock it, and this time the file has been converted to random numbers, and you give this briefcase to James.
When the briefcase wasn't delivered, you called him and told him the code.
Once he gets the briefcase, enter the password, the file decipher is complete, it's perfect, and you successfully passed a encrypted message to James Bond.
A funny example, but it shows three points of encryption.
Password -- we call it encryption keys.
You can imagine it as a code.
Tell James the phone number.
We call it a secret key transfer.
It's a guarantee that we can safely send the key to the designated location.
And the locks used to encrypt and decrypt files.
We call it encryption algorithms.
By the key, it converts the contents of the file to random numbers.
A good algorithm can do that, and it's hard to break the password without a secret key.
The importance of algorithms is that if someone gets a briefcase, open it, without a secret key, no encryption algorithm, can't read the contents of the document.
It's just some random numbers.
Most security systems rely on secure key transfer, passing the key to the right place.
However, the rapidly growing computing capacity endangers many of the key transfer methods we're using.
For example, we're now applying a very wide range of systems - RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it took about 40 billion years to crack a 426-bit RSA key.
And in 1994, it was only 17 years later, and the code was broken.
As computers get stronger, we need longer codes.
Now we often use 2048 or 4096 passwords.
As you can see, the battle between the encryption and the decryptor is under way, and they all want to beat each other.
In the next 10 to 15 years, quantum computers will be able to crack complex mathematical algorithms faster, which are the basis of the encryption system we use today.
In fact, quantum computers will turn our safe castle into a touch-down card house.
We're gonna try to protect our castle.
There have been many research institutions in recent years, studying how to enhance encryption with quantum effects.
People have made some exciting breakthroughs.
Remember the three priorities of encryption, high-quality secret keys, secure key transfer and strong algorithms.
However, the advances in science and engineering have threatened two of these priorities.
The first thing to do is the key.
Random numbers are the basis for the key.
But today, they're no longer really random.
At present, we generate the key, based on random digital frequency, based on software, which we call false random numbers.
The numbers that programs or mathematical methods generate, there's always some, maybe not so obvious in it.
The lower the randomness of these numbers, or in terms, the lower the thorium, the easier they are to predict.
Recently, some casinos were attacked, and the way they attacked was creative.
They shot the tiger machine for a while, and then they analyze it.
Cyber criminals use reverse engineering to create a pseudo random digital generator behind the wheel.
So they have a great chance of predicting the rotation of the wheel, making a lot of money.
The key is also not safe.
Having a real random digital generator is important for generating secure passwords.
For years, researchers have been trying to create a real random digital generator.
But most of the designs are either not random, either fast enough or hard to repeat.
But quantum world is really random.
It's important to use this real randomity.
Devices that measure quantum effects can generate continuous random digital streams very quickly.
There's no possibility of a casino crime.
Several universities and companies from around the world are focusing on creating real random digital generators.
In my company, our quantum random digital generator was born at an optical table 2 meters long.
Then we narrow it down to a box size.
So far, you can put it on a PCI card, plug it on a normal computer.
It's the fastest, really random digital generator in the world.
It can generate 1 billion random numbers per second by measuring quantum effects.
Today has been widely used around the world to improve the security of cloud service providers, banks and government agencies.
But even with a real random digital generator, we're facing the second largest cyber security threat: the security transfer of the key.
The current key transfer technology cannot counter quantum computers.
And the quantum solution to this problem, called quantum key distribution, known as QKD, uses a basic nature of quantum mechanics against instinct.
Watching microparticles will change the particle.
Let me give you an example.
Let's think about it again. Give James Bond the code.
But this time, we don't call him, we use quantum effects, carry this code with a bunch of lasers, and pass it to James through a normal fibre.
We assume Dr. Node wants this code.
Fortunately, Dr. Norse leaves electronic fingerprints in trying to intercept this quantum key, and James and you can detect it.
So the key that's intercepted will be scraped.
And the key left behind can provide strong protection for data.
Because this security mechanism is based on physics fundamentals, quantum computers, or any future supercomputer, can't break it.
My team and I are working with many top universities and defense departments to improve this exciting technology and develop the next generation of safety products.
The Internet is a sign of a era of high interconnection, and it is expected that 25-30 billion devices will be connected to the Internet by 2020.
To think our society is functioning in the world of the Internet, trust in these interconnected equipment systems is essential.
We believe that quantum technology is important for building this trust, and it will ensure that we fully enjoy these magical innovations, and that it will make our lives rich and colorful.
Thank you.

What's the point of a 3-year-old college playground?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Journal of the Rule of Law by Wang Si-seok Responsible Editor: Wang Si-seok
The playground was smashed, and the children were paid to the school.
Zhao Yifan, Correspondent of the newspaper
Three-year-old Man was accidentally hit in the head when he was playing at a college playground.
After Chen's compensation, Mr. Wen, as legal agent for the small text, filed an apology at the school at the place of conduct and paid medical expenses, mental damage comforts, etc. for a total of $20,000.
Recently, the People ' s Court of the Haidian District of Beijing held that the school had established a protective net at the time of the incident, had fulfilled appropriate security obligations and that Chen had already paid compensation, and that the plaintiff ' s claim had been dismissed.
Mr. Wen complained that during the summer of 2019, he took Man to play at the school playground, when he was training on the field.
To avoid the risks posed, Mr. Wen and many other kids and parents are operating in a safe area designated by the soft team.
But then the soft team team, Chen, took off his hand when he threw it, led softball to fly across the net to the safety area and hit the back of Man.
Mr. Wen immediately took Wen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with trauma.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities of the school stadium are not in line with the relevant safety requirements and that the team and related facilities are not effectively managed.
The school's fault caused the above-mentioned events, causing great suffering from the physical and mental pain of the small Man, and has caused greater suffering to its families, and the school should be legally liable.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up a net on the playground and posted regulations, training notifications that access to the playground must remain safe from the training site and reminding itself of its safety, and that the plaintiff could not prove that the school "not fulfilled its safety obligations", and therefore did not agree with compensation.
After trial, the court found that the University involved a free open site for the public, and that schools, although there was a safety and security obligation to manage playgrounds, such a security obligation would only have to meet the general obligation of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a net at the time of the playground, had fulfilled appropriate safety obligations and that Chen had paid Man for the losses of medical expenses, transportation costs, etc., in accordance with the previous compensation agreement, and the parties agreed to settle the dispute once.
After that, the parents of Man again advocated school compensation, and the court ruled that the plaintiff was dismissed.
After the sentence, neither party had appealed and the judgement was now in force.
According to article 37 of the Law on Liability for Violations, schools, as the administrator of public places, have a security and security obligation; in the event of harm caused by the third person, the third person is responsible for the violation, while the public place administrator who has not fulfilled the obligation to secure security shall assume the corresponding additional responsibility.
The judge stated that, since, as the administrator of public places, it was most likely to understand the actual situation of the entire site and to predict possible hazards and damage, thus the most likely to take the necessary measures to prevent or mitigate damage and to avoid and mitigate the least cost of damage, the law provides for its corresponding safeguards for social activities.
In this case, the safety and security obligations of schools should be adapted to the social activities they carry out in the playgrounds that are open to the public, inter alia, basic security measures and the obligation to inform for hidden hazards.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive safety and security obligations on public officials.
If the school has taken the protection net and has fulfilled its obligation to inform, it can be determined that the school is not wrong and should not be legally liable.
Moreover, responsibility for third-person violations, even if managers in public places such as schools have not fulfilled their security obligations, are complementary to damages, and the manager can recover from a third person after the recently enacted civil code.
Therefore, in such accidents, victims should no longer expand their claims after receiving compensation for direct torts.
Today I want to show you the way we make things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be able to assemble themselves, replicate themselves and repair themselves.
So I'm going to show you what I think of the current state of manufacturing, and then compare it with some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years, 500,000 to millions of parts, very complex, using new technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space -- five years, 2.5 million parts.
But on the other hand, if we look at the natural system, we have two million types of protein that can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, and we can copy DNA with three billion base pairs in about an hour.
That's the complexity of our natural systems, but they're very efficient, more efficient than anything we can build, more complicated than anything we can build.
They're more efficient in energy.
They rarely make mistakes.
They can fix themselves for a long life.
There's something super interesting about the natural system.
If we can convert it into our building environment, then the way we build things will have great potential.
I think the point is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all the complexity of what we're building -- our buildings and machines.
We need to decode them into simple sequences -- basically the DNA that our building operates.
And then we need programmable parts that accept this sequence and use it for folding or remodeling.
We need some energy to activate, so that these parts can fold according to the program.
We need some kind of correction redundancy to make sure we're building what we want.
So I'm going to show you some of the projects that my colleagues are doing to achieve this self-assembly future.
The first two projects are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale re-engineered robots -- 8 feet, 12 feet long protein.
They're embedded in electromechanical equipment, sensors.
You need to decode the way you want to fold, decode it into a series of angles -- negative 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees, 0 degrees, 0 degrees, 120 degrees, 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees -- something like this; a series of angles, or turning, which can be passed through by wire.
Each unit gets its own message -- negative 120. It rotates, checks if it rotates in place and pass the sequence to its neighbors.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers, designers working for this project.
I think this project really reveals: is this really scalable?
I mean, it costs thousands of dollars to make this eight-foot robot.
Can we really expand it? Can we really embed robots in every part?
The next question is to look at passiveity, or passive attempts to make reorganization programmable.
But it's one step further, it tries to actually calculate.
Basically embedded in the base building module of most calculations, digital logic doors, directly into all parts.
It's with the non-door.
Each door to calculate has a tetrahedron, and two input tetrahedrus.
One of them is input from the user, like you're building bricks.
The other is the input of a brick that was put before coming.
And then it gives a three-dimensional output.
That means users build bricks in the way they want.
It's calculated on the basis of what you did and your instructions.
Now it's moving in three-dimensional space -- up or down.
Look at the left, [1,1] input equals zero output, which means down.
On the right, [0,0] input is 1 output, indicating up.
So the real meaning is that our structure now contains blueprints we want to build.
So all the information about what you want to build is embedded.
That means we have some kind of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed reproduction, because your structure contains precise blueprints.
If you have a mistake, you can replace a part.
All local information is embedded in it and tells you how to fix it.
So you have something to climb, read it and output one by one.
It's embedded directly; no external command input.
The last project I'm going to show is called the heart chain, which is probably the most exciting example of the passive self-assembly system we've seen now.
It's reconstructive and programmable, making it a fully passive system.
Basically, you have a series of elements.
Each element is exactly the same, and they're partial.
Each chain, or every element wants to turn right or left.
If you want to assemble a chain, you need to program it.
To tell each unit to turn left or right.
When you shake this chain, it folds up to program any structure you encode for it -- so in this case, a spiral, fire, two connected cubes.
Basically, you can program in three-dimensional space -- or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- the chain is completely passive.
What future does this give us?
I think it tells us the possibility of this self-assembly, self-replicating and self-rehabilitation in our body structure, our buildings and machines.
There's a new programmable nature in these parts.
You can get a new possibility of calculating.
We'll have room to calculate.
Imagine our buildings, bridges, machines, all bricks can be actually calculated.
What a surprising parallel computing and distributed computing capability and new design possibilities.
It's an exciting potential.
I think these projects I've shown you are just a small step towards the future, if we achieve these new technologies for a new self-assembly world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the normal state of epidemic control, people's sports and fitness are rising.
As the cross-saving tourism business is gradually liberalized, the tourism market is about to recover.
Fujian Province resumed cross-Provincial tourism operations since July 21, and the first weekend after opening, the gate that was a tourist destination was at a peak.
As a popular tourist destination city, there are many tourists arriving on weekends.
The train station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer, while the airport traffic is dominated by students, tourism, family visits.
The tourism market is warming up, and in July, the airport runs 440 times a day, and domestic flights have recovered to 80% of the pre-disease.
The airline encrypted the air fast lines in major cities like Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Sian, and took over the recovery tourism market.
Currently, many travel agencies in Xiamen are on the line with a group of summer cross-saving products, which are mainly outdoor sites.
For railway stations, the summer passenger peak at the airport, the relevant units sent additional personnel in areas such as on-site counters, security access routes, etc., and the optimization of the eight health codes, and achieving health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, promoting an orderly recovery in the tourism market.
Can Liu Dehua Liu Qingyun "discretion" new sparks - Xinhua Network
Bombing Specialist 2 recently announced that it would be released on December 24th, becoming the first set-up film in the Hee-year-old.
The second is still the director of Qui Litao, the producer and lead actor of Liu De Wa, with a whole new story.
According to the information received, the addition of the nuclear bomb element in the second part has also made the challenge faced by the bomb-dismantling experts more difficult, and the premonition of a few of the most amazing footage, the great explosion of mushroom clouds, the airport that was swallowed by fire, was quite shocking.
Three years ago, the bomb-dismantling expert, produced by the original class horse, won the 5-1 ticket room champion of the year and won seven nominations for the Hong Kong Film Gold Award, and Qiu Litao Liu De Wa became a gold partner in the audience's mind.
This time, the bomb disposal expert 2 is also expected again to wipe out a new spark for the ace.
Bombing Specialist 2 tells a whole new story: former bomb disposal expert Pan was fainted at the bombing scene and was listed as a suspect by the police.
To find the truth, he had to ask Dong Zhuowen, a friend of the bomb disposal expert.
The woman who was anxious to solve the case was also involved in Pan's ex-girlfriend.
Still a bomb disposal specialist, but it felt the complexity of Liu De Wa's new role from the pre-schedule: broke a leg, put on a prosthetic limb, and was hunted down by Liu Qing Yun, who was the same bomb expert, while being directed by his ex-girlfriend Nini.
What was the relationship between the three, what did Liu De Wa do at the Chanshima Hotel and what was involved in the case of what he had been involved in?
It is understood that the film's most important play is a world landmark building in Hong Kong, plus the top special effects production team, which brings a real visual shock.

On July 26, the Central New Network reported that July 26th was Russian Navy Day, where the main parade to celebrate Navy Day was held in St. Petersburg and Kalunstadt.
The Russian President, the Supreme Commander of the Russian Armed Forces, Putin, arrived in Kalunstadt to attend the celebration, where 15 ships and submarines were examined.
On July 28, 2019, local time, St. Petersburg, Russia, celebrated the Navy Festival.
Putin reportedly congratulated the Navy on Navy Day and on a boat on a boat that was about to join the sea parade on the Gulf of Finland, and then to examine the military at the subjective stage.
Putin says the Russian Navy fleet is equipped with the latest ship and special equipment, and the level of equipment is increasing.
Putin said in the Russian Navy Day parade: "The Russian Navy fleet has high-precision warships, strategic dive cruisers and multipurpose submarines, latest aircraft, unique weapons and special equipment. "
On June 24, local time, Russia commemorates the 75th anniversary of the victory of the war in the country.
He also stated that the Russian naval fleet would achieve unique advantages by digital and effective defense.
According to reports, the main naval parade to celebrate Russian Naval Day was held in St. Petersburg and Karunstadt, with 46 ships participating, including the frigate "General Casatonov", the large anti-submarine vessel of Admiral Kurakov, as well as large landing vessels, small missile vessels, frigates, submarines, etc.
Among them, the series of ships was displayed static by the Winter Palace Bridge in St. Petersburg, the most remarkable of which was the first Russian warship, the Portava, which was copied at the beginning of the 18th century.
To avoid the spread of the new coronary virus, only local residents and special guests during the Navy parade this year were able to enter Kalonstadt.
The last Sunday of July is Russian Navy Day.
Yang Hong, founder of the Beijing Elysian Choir, died at 86 years old - China New Net
On July 26th, the Beijing Elle Choir issued a obituary, founder of the Beijing Ele Choir, a prominent Chinese commander, music educator, a lifelong academic member of the Central Music Academy, Professor Yang Hong, who died in Beijing on 26 July 2020, 86 years old.
Image by Beijing Elysium Network of Officials.
Yang Hong was born in 1934, the Jiangsu Nanking, who loved music since he was a child.
Commander of the Nanjing People ' s Radio Choir in 1951, who was admitted to the Chinese Department of Music in Shanghai in the autumn of 1951, studied command from Professor Yang Ka-in and German commander Hizman, to learn the tune and re-reconcilitation of forward Soviet expert Alzamanov.
He was taught in 1958 at the Faculty of Music, Beijing Academy of Arts and Teachers, and transferred to the Central Music Academy, and the Department of Command.
Yang Hong founded the Beijing Elle Choir in 1983.
For more than 30 years, he led the choir around the world with the purpose of "love and dedication" and won dozens of prizes in important national and foreign competitions.
He was in charge of the Central Orchestra, the Central National Song and Dance Group, the Orient Dance Group, the Shanghai Choir, and held several symphony concerts and concerts.
The books are "The Band Training", "Singing Training", "The Two Song Writings", "The Children's Songs" and thesis "Singing Question", "The Sound Level Layout of Orchestra", and the translation of "Singing the chorus" and "Debussy's and Voice Language".
Do you know how many flowers are there?
There are 250,000 -- at least we know so many -- 250,000 flower plants.
And flowers are a problem.
It's really hard to grow plants.
It takes a lot of experience and a lot of resources.
Why is it so troubled?
Of course, the answer is, like many other things in the world, sex.
I know what you think when you look at these pictures.
Sexual reproduction is so important -- plants have many other ways to breed.
It can be used in a branch; it can breed the same sex; it can pollute the same plant.
But they do need to spread their genes mixed with other genes, so they can be ecological.
That's how evolution works.
Now the way plants pass this message through pollen.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every family should have a scan microscope that can see these.
There are many different types of pollen in many species of flower plants.
It's actually quite useful for forensics and so on.
Most of them will cause us to have pollen from plants that spread pollen with wind, which is a very inefficient process, and that's why pollen always runs into our noses.
Because most of them were abandoned, hoping that reproductive cells, male reproductive cells, would happen to fall on another flower.
All the grass, that means all the grain, and most trees spread pollen by wind.
But most species actually use insects to do this process, and in a way it's smarter, because it doesn't require much pollen.
Insects and other species can carry pollen, move pollen directly where they need it.
Obviously, we noticed the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship, whether birds or bees, and they get a reward, and usually the return is nectar.
Sometimes this symbiotic relationship can lead to wonderful adaptive changes -- red skirt moths are a beautiful adaptive change.
Plants have harvests, and the twilight spreads pollen elsewhere.
Plants evolved, creating landing runways everywhere, bees may be lost.
Some of the plants look like other insects.
These are lilies, very clever, so when the unwitting insects fall on it, the pollen bag flips over and hit the insect back with a lot of pollen so that they can follow insects to other plants.
There's a orchid that looks like there's a jaw, and in a way, it does; it forces insects to climb, put pollen on it and take pollen somewhere else.
Orchid: At least 20,000 orchids -- a variety of amazing things.
They have all kinds of tricks.
They have to try and attract polluters to help them complete the process.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, was studied by Darwin and gave a wonderful prediction when he saw it, and there was a long nectar that fell down from the orchid.
Basically, what insects have to do is -- we come to the middle of the flower -- and it stabbs the mouth into the middle of the way to know the nectar tube down to get nectar.
Darwin said, "Look at this flower, "I guess something has evolved with it."
No doubt, it's insects.
I mean, it usually rolls up, but it's straight after, it looks like this.
Now imagine that if nectar is so valuable to produce plants at a high cost and attracts many polluters, then, as in human sex, people may start to cheat each other.
They might say, "I have some nectar.
It's a plant.
This plant is loved by South African insects, which evolved long mouths to get the bottom nectar.
It's an imitator.
This plant is imitating the first plant.
There's a fly with a long mouth, and it doesn't get any nectar from the fake, because the fake didn't give it any nectar, and it thought it could get it.
So, not only did flies get nectar from fake plants, and -- if you look very close to the top of the head, you'll see some pollen there that will be spread to other plants, if no botanist comes over and stick it to a blue card.
This lie is spread throughout the plant kingdom.
This flower with black spots: they may look like black spots to us, but I tell you, for the male insects of the proper species, it looks like two very, very sexy females.
When insects arrive and land on it, they soak themselves into pollen, and of course, the pollen will be taken to other plants, and if you look at the images that every family should have scanned electron microscopes, you can see some patterns, three-dimensional patterns.
It even makes insects feel comfortable, and it looks good.
These electron microscope images -- this is a orchid disguised as an insect -- and you can see that for our eyes, different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures, and insects may feel very, very different textures.
This orchid evolves to imitate the metal-lighted surfaces that are seen in some beetles.
Under the scanning electron microscope, you can see this surface -- it's very different from the other surfaces we've seen.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even if we look like insects.
I mean, I think it looks like some kind of flying animal or beast.
It's a wonderful and magical thing.
It's called Black Rock.
I think it's sometimes cunning.
For the type of bees, it looks like another very aggressive bee, and it flies over and hit it many times with its head, trying to get rid of it, of course, it'll put pollen on it.
Another thing it does is that this plant imitates another orchid rich in insect-loving food.
But there's nothing.
So it cheats on two levels -- it's incredible.
What we see is Eland, with a strong scent.
I actually smelled it before.
These flowers don't really have to be so beautiful.
They smell amazingly attractive to any interested insect.
This flower doesn't smell good.
This flower actually smells very bad. Again, it's evolution, it looks like rotting meat.
So the fly likes it.
The flies fly in and pollute them.
It's a white star taro, also known as the Dead Horse.
I don't know what a dead horse smells, but this flower may smell very much.
It's horrible.
The green fly can't help it.
Fly into it, fly all the way into it.
It's a nice piece of rotting meat on it, and it's not aware that there's no eggs here, and these eggs will die here, but at the same time this plant will benefit, because hard hair looses the fly disappears, pollination to another flower -- amazing.
It's a potato plant, O'Hae, Zephyr Aro, which is called the long-age grass in this country.
I shot this last week in Dosset.
This guy's heating up about 15 degrees higher than the ambient temperature -- incredible.
If you look inside it, the meat is a little like a dam, and flies attract heat -- it's a boiling volatile chemical, worm -- they're trapped under this container.
They drink sweet nectar and then they all get a little sticky.
They're covered in pollen at night, sprayed down by them, and then the hard hair we see on it gets dead and they're getting out of here -- it's incredible.
If you think it's incredible, this one is my favorite.
It's a spring feather.
People from Brazil should know this plant.
It's the most amazing thing.
It's about a foot long.
It has the ability I know that no other plant has, and when it blooms -- it's in the middle of the meat -- for about two days, it's causing some metabolic changes, some of them like mammals.
And it doesn't have starch, it's plant food, it has very brown fat stuff that burns it at the speed of burning fat, metabolism, about a little cat.
Two times the energy output of hummingbird by weight ratio -- absolutely amazing.
It also did something unusual.
Not only will it warm to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Celsius, but it will keep warm.
One of the temperature regulation mechanisms is used to keep the temperature constant.
Why would you do that? I heard you ask.
You don't know yet, some Beatles like to mate at this temperature.
They drill in, covered in pollen.
Plants are covered in pollen, let them go, pollination.
What a wonderful thing to do.
Now we think most polluters are insects, but in fact, in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also produce powder.
Many tropical flowers are red, because butterflies and birds are similar to us, and we think, very good to see red.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue to see this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, they see all kinds of dark ultraviolet light.
There's some color behind this.
"If we can see those colors, it's not good," I heard you ask.
Yes, we can see it.
So what do insects see?
Last week I took pictures of these desert loties, half-day flowers, in Dosset.
As we can see, it's a little yellow flower, and it's all over the place.
It looks like this in visible light.
If it looks like it's the case to remove the red.
Most bees can't feel red.
And then I put ultraviolet filters in front of my camera for a long time at a specific frequency of ultraviolet light, and I got this picture.
It's like a real, wonderful target.
Now we don't know what the bees see, when I call it red, you know what I'm looking at.
We can't know what happened, whether it's insects, or in the brain of other humans.
But the contrast seems to be like this.
It's another flower -- in different ultraviolet frequency zones, different filters to match different polluters.
It looks like it.
To avoid you think that all yellow flowers have this attribute -- no damage to flowers during the shoot; just stick it on the tripod, not take it off -- under ultraviolet light, look at this.
It's the basis for sunscreen, because sunscreen works by absorb ultraviolet light.
So maybe the chemicals are useful.
Finally, it's a night of fragrance that came to me by Bjorn Rorslett in Norway -- a wonderful hidden pattern.
I like this hidden way.
These pictures are taken with ultraviolet filters, which are mainly used by astronomers to film Venus -- actually the clouds on Venus.
This is the main use of this filter.
Of course, Venus is the God of Love and Birth, which is the word of flowers.
As flowers have spent so much effort trying to attract polluters to accept their invitations, somehow they have succeeded in believing that it contains a rich meaning that we send flowers out of each other when we were born and died, especially when you thought of it, just at this moment, genetic matter moved from one cell to another.
Thank you very much.

On July 26, the Chongqing City Development and Reform Commission of Chongqing City of Chongqing announced that the city has so far withdrawn 4404 fishermen, or 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
In an interview with the 53-year-old Lee Deok-kyu, a journalist from the Chinese Net, said that his grandfather was fishing in the Dragon Creek River since he was 11 years old, he was walking along the Dragon Creek River, went up to Chongqing Liangping, and he was a long life, and every time he left home, he was 10 days and a half months old, and he kept his family alive by beating fish.
But since 1997, as the rural population gradually flows into the town, the growing number of inhabitants in the town of Gao An, has also increased environmental pollution.
Paper mills, chemical plants, farms, and water pollution along the Dragon Creek River.
By 2007, the Dragon Creek River had become a stinking ditch.
"The fish chips caught are black, and they're black when they're cut."
Lee Deok said it was getting harder to fish after the water was contaminated.
The local force began to manage the pollution of the Dragon Creek River, including drifting, river patrol, aquatic resource management.
Lee Deok-kuk also withdrew from fishermen and became a member of the river patrol, managing aquatic resources.
From 1 January 2020, the water-bio reserves in Chongqing City and related waters in the main city have been completely banned.
According to the Chongqing Development Reform Commission, to date, Chongqing City has accumulated 3403 fishing vessels, 4643 fishing vessels have been signed, representing 63.3 per cent of the total three-year mission, 86.3 per cent, 86.3 per cent.
4404 fishermen have been withdrawn, or 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Of the 4404 people, 4267 were employed, or 96.89 per cent of the fishermen who had been withdrawn.
Old-age insurance coverage covers 2691 persons, or 61.10% of the return of fishermen.
Next, Chongqing City will carry out a dedicated treatment operation to accelerate the clean-up of the Yangtze dry stream line, complete a new round of river-in-water vent censuses and the corresponding treatment operations, largely completing the "triphos" (the phosphorus, phosphorus chemical and phosphorus plaster bank), the small water and electricity clean-up, the greening of the Yangtze two banks, strengthening green mines, consolidate the Yangtze dry stream illegal docks, illegal sand mining, and further advance the withdrawal of the Yangtze River stream.
Israel strengthens repeated control of the epidemic - the new network
2020-07-26 04:56:44 Source: Light Daily by Wang Si-seok Responsible Editor: Wang Si-seok
Israel has strengthened its repeated control of the epidemic
In the early stages of the outbreak of new coronary pneumonia, Israel's control measures were significantly effective.
However, with the gradual release of control measures, the recent number of new coronary pneumonia diagnosis in Israel has increased significantly, and the Israeli Government has taken numerous urgent measures to strengthen its control of the epidemic.
On 28 February, the first case of new coronary pneumonia was diagnosed on Israeli mainland to rapidly take the closure of all entry and exit ports, the suspension of all non-necessary industries, the school was converted to online teaching, limiting public transport and unnecessary social activities, the blockade of serious epidemic cities, the joint maintenance and control initiatives of military and police.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results, and by mid-May, new cases of new coronary pneumonia confirmed by Israel had fallen to a single-day basis.
With the control of the epidemic, Israel's control measures were completely unsealed, and since June, the new number of new diagnosis of coronary pneumonia has gradually rebounded.
Especially after July, the spread of the epidemic is accelerating.
Recently, there have been more than 1,500 new cases per day in Israel, with 916 new cases as of 25 July.
As of 25 July, 59745 confirmed cases in Israel and 448 deaths.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli Government has taken urgent measures to strengthen its control of the epidemic.
On 6 July, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli Government closed public entertainment sites such as gymnasiums, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs, and introduced a policy of limiting public transport, providing that no more than 20 passengers per bus could not exceed 20 passengers.
On 17th, a series of new restrictions were announced by the Government, including the "Closed City" on weekends, providing for the implementation of the "Closed City" between Friday and 5 p.m. a week.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping centres, hairdressers, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic services such as supermarkets, pharmacys, etc. will remain open.
At the same time, within all dates and periods, more than 10 people are prohibited from gatherings, gymnasiums, studios, etc. will be closed, restaurants and cafes, and only take-out services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli population did not give sufficient attention to the gravity of the epidemic and failed to work with the Government in combating the epidemic.
After the Israeli epidemic repeated, many people went out to protest the march on the streets for government control affecting their economic interests.
On 11 July, tens of thousands of people marched in Tel Aviv to believe that anti-disease policies affected the economy.
On the evening of 21, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem, protesting Prime Minister Netanyahu's prohibition of the ban on restaurants, cafes, etc., without compensation.
Moreover, many people do not comply with the requirements of wearing masks and maintaining two metres of safe social distance, and in order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people wear masks on their chins or hanging on wrists.
During the repeated period of the epidemic, schools were a major disaster area for the spread of the new coronary virus, and according to journalists ' recent visits to the kindergarten, no teachers and students in kindergarten had not worn masks as required by the government and did not maintain a safe social distance of two metres from each other and buried a large number of teachers and students with the virus.
Professor Eli Waxman, member of the Advisory Group of Experts on the Prevention of the Epidemic of the Israeli National Security Council, believes that Israel is moving towards a "dangerous situation", noting that Israel ' s current epidemic control measures are not enough and that all leisure, recreational sites and summer schools should be closed to control further spread.
Waxman states that Israel lacks a master plan to combat the epidemic, and that parliamentary and government departments should immediately reject their interests and agree on the fight against the epidemic and develop clear steps that include relevant restrictions in different sectors.
This newspaper's call from Tel Aviv on July 25th, the newspaper's journalist in Tel Aviv, Wang Zheng.
Ningxiaguhara farmer Wu Fengfang can't stand up with his old companion in a car, from home 20 miles away to the Liang Yun Cultural compound.
Despite the two years of trouble, 77-year-old Da Tianfu is still counting on "Come here, having a trick."
This is a low-profile yard in the former state of Kuwon, unlike the general farm yard, the Qin cavity that is often passed out in the yard, and the great leather scenes, embroidery, traditional Qin, the eyebrows, etc.
The owner of the compound is Liang Yun, a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he loved the film, and he started planning to build a cultural compound.
With the Liang Yun Cultural compound, the villagers' cultural life has become rich and colorful.
The reporter hasn't walked into the Liang Yun Cultural compound, and the Qin Quixian tune has been passed on.
The Qin contest is being played for the folks, and the village village village, Bresham.
She loves Qin since she was a child, and now she's a little famous in the area, and she'll come to the cultural compound to perform for the folks.
Recently, Brethren also played live on the Internet.
Brethren said, "It's a happy thing to have a stage to show more people."
On stage, the singers are on the stage, and the singers are a tune, and they're amateurs, but they're not less passionate.
Like the simple style of the farm home, outside the Qin language, the "grass" art and non-removable culture in the Liang Yun Cultural compound are coming.
The compound also contains over 300 pieces of agricultural tools, traditional and handmade walrus, paper cutting, embroidery, leather shadows, etc.
Liang Yun led reporters into the gallery in the yard, showing his old stuff, the old winepot, the tristring, the spin-off car, etc.
Why did a regular farmer build a cultural compound?
"The film is my home-based art, and I've been studying it since I was 15."
The Liang Yun Cultural Complex was founded in 2012 as the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition" in Ningxia and a model compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in the city of Guangwon.
In addition to the Liang Yun Cultural compound, the former state district of Guangwon has emerged from more than 120 cultural colleges, 79 civil performing groups, of which have more than 50 cultural colleges, such as the Shen Jia River Cultural compound, Wang Yonghong Cultural compound, Yang Long Cultural compound, etc., covering towns and streets in the former state district, with over 5,000 participants.
These grass-roots artists are active in the field, enriching the cultural lives of the people and meets their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better, traditional culture cannot be left behind. "
The Willow War is back, and the winner is watching Willow Yunlong Li Li Li Li's "The Play" - Xinhua Network
The 40th War Show "The Winning" will land in Beijing on July 16th.
The winnings are adapted to the true history of the Soviet military files that have been in existence for years.
The famous actor Willow Yunlong, who was known to the audience, challenged a very happy "sniffing agent".
In recent years, the red play of the disguise masked kite has proven to be alive in the type of war.
Unlike the old war, "wins" look at the world and extend the story to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
It, in the context of the final phase of the war against Japan in 1944, tells the story of the Russian Army's secret intelligence staff Don Fei, under the leadership of the Secretary of the Forest River Provincial Council of the China Underground Party and the Director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency.
In a lot of war shows, the lead man, as a senior spy, is a handsome, IQ, a perfect image of maturity.
But it's not right for such a person to be a spy, "Spy should be the kind of person who can't find in a pile of people, and if it comes out, it's a very handsome image that everyone should be watching you, and can you still sneak?" There's a line in the kite, "You don't come after me, I forget I'm a National Party," and the spy is going to be elite."
So in the Winner, Yoo Yunlong, don't design his master Tang Fei as a happy "sniffy agent".
The other side of the "win" camp was carried out by Fukuhara and Li Li Liang's police chief Fong Shibao.
Two powerful players in the south and north, adding a lot of good work to the whole show.
The director Yin Fei used the word "scramble" to describe the play of Li Li Li and Yoo Yunlong, "It's definitely a drama, and they're very close to me, and they're very powerful for me. Many times their play is "screw," like we only write half a page of paper, and I don't stop when they shoot, and they can keep playing."
The masters don't play, the directors don't mess with each other, and when actors are in the role and guarantee their character status, they can not only shape their roles from a character perspective, but also offer the audience more possibilities for viewing, and Yin Fei says it's a great show.
In the play, you can see many familiar faces in the Willow War, and when the kite was hit, the windy "F4" was gathered in three of them in the "wins."
He played Song Xiao An and Zhao Jane's Huo Yi and Liu Nam Yang, and this time he played Tang Fei's right arm again.
Director Yin Fei introduced, "These two people have no bad roots, but in that time, the environment was flowing."
Yoo Yunlong also offered to say, "We want someone to taste. This man's taste is that there must be good and bad, bad people are enemies, but we're going to grow them, and our team will grow up."
The end of the show was carefully designed by Willow Yunlong, and he believed that he would hand over a satisfactory response to the audience.

Four students drowned in the Inner Mongolian flag.
On the evening of July 26, the Chinese New Net, Hurenbel, the journalist was informed from the Aung flag government in the city of Hurenbel, the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia, four local students died of drowning.
On 24 July, at 1550 hours, the Aung Flag Public Security Bureau received a call that six junior high school students drowned.
After the police, the local civilian police arrived at the scene and rescued two students on the spot, and then the local emergency department, the Water Department, etc., arrived at the scene and participated in the rescue.
It was described that more than 80 people were sent to the rescue site, such as the police police, Sen police, fire, medical care, and three rubber boats were sent to the surrounding waters and hired a professional rescue team to arrive at the site to conduct underwater searches through sonar detection.
The journalist learned that local rescue workers found the first student killed on 25 July at 0640 hours, and that the second student was killed at 1130 hours on 25th, and that the third victim was found at 1240 hours on 25th, and at 1334 hours on 25th, when the last student was found, and that four of them had been identified by the local emergency centre without vital signs.
Officially, the drowning has sounded the alarm for the whole society.
Currently, local government departments are organizing some knowledge of preventing drowning, hoping that tragedy will no longer happen.
Xinhua Hong Kong, 25 July, Hong Kong, Director of Financial Affairs and Treasury, Hong Kong Government, said that Hong Kong's financial markets remain active and orderly operational.
He is optimistic about financial stability and economy in Hong Kong.
At an online seminar co-organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce (Canada General) on 24th (Torondo Time) stated that Hong Kong had experienced difficult conditions because of the "repeated wind wave" and the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
The Hong Kong dollar exchange price is stable and the level of security for the strong.
There are no clear signs of financial flows in the banking system, but instead, more than $11 billion since June.
The total deposits of banks have also continued to increase over the past few months, with a series of open stock-raising activities in the stock market, and market transactions have been rising.
Xu Jung-woo said that the new coronary pneumonia epidemic had put pressure on the global economic and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remained unchanged.
Hong Kong has many advantages, including geography, rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of information and funds and simple low-tax systems, which have made Hong Kong a leading international financial centre.
Xu Jung-woo noted that the HK$ 6 billion reserved for HK$ 6 billion in the Anti-Pestination Fund, creating about 30,000 time-bound positions in the public and private sectors over the next two years, covering different skills and academic qualifications.
To support the development of financial science and technology, the District Government has also launched the "Ten thousand people" project to finance local financial technology companies, start-ups and other financial technology-related businesses to create 1,000 new positions, hire local talent and enrich Hong Kong's financial technology talent base.
Looking ahead, Xu Jung-woo is optimistic about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to use Hong Kong ' s strengths and their status as international financial centres, the International Assets and Wealth Management Centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, to develop and invest in the Gulf of Hong Kong and nearby areas.
The "Lows" paper commends China for its efforts to combat disease and encourage countries to learn from their experiences - the new network of China.
According to the 25th Journal of Willow Sword, China, as a country with 1.4 billion people, similar to Europe or the United States, the new coronary epidemic is effectively controlled at this stage, without any more widespread transmission, largely controlling the domestic epidemic.
According to the article, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction over almost a decade, making China much more prepared for the new crown than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of the year.
The author states that at the beginning of the SARS outbreak in 2002, China was not well prepared, especially the pathogen.
When the new coronary virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus and shared genome sequence data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had explained the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world about the threat of the new coronary virus by a research paper published on the Willow Sword.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, and in the state of emergency, through close domestic cooperation, such research was carried out very quickly and strictly, and in May and July, the results of progress made in the early trials of the new coronary vaccine developed by China in May and July, respectively.
China ' s experience has shown that investing in national health and research systems is important to effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for the rapid and effective response of health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are worth learning and learning.
Moreover, Chinese experience has shown that, based on strong research, there must be strong high-level decisive decision-making on the right basis, which has effectively controlled the new coronary epidemic.
The article emphasizes that Governments and their leaders must respect science, understand the value of science and act on them in the most favourable way of society.
In the early days of the outbreak, the Chinese National Defence Commission sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risks and transmission of the new coronary virus, which provided the basis for the decision of Wuhan on 23 January; when experts proposed the need and urgency of building square-class hospitals, the Government quickly decided and implemented quickly; while the widespread participation of communities and the population also led to rapid and effective control of the epidemic.
The article concludes that responding to global health emergencies, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and to respond jointly.

The former Inspector of the Uhai City Council of the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia was dismissed from the Party.
According to the Monitoring Committee of the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia, the Committee of the Disciplinary Commission of the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia, with the approval of the Party Committee of the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia, has conducted a case review of serious disciplinary violations by the former Inspector of the Uhai City Council.
The platinum Sea, as a member of the party leader, lost its ideal belief, openly contrary to party principles for his own personal benefit and countering the restructuring of the patrol; the idea of organization was a desolence, in violation of the mobilization of others and receiving other people's property in the selection of the cadres; economic greed, in violation of commercial enterprises to obtain huge benefits, trade in power, to make the right to privacy; and to corrupt life, which has a negative impact.
The Platinum Sea is seriously contrary to political discipline, organizational discipline, integrity discipline, life discipline, which constitutes a crime of bribe and suspected of bribes, corruption, and does not take place after the 18th anniversary of the party, does not take over, in bad nature, and should be seriously addressed.
Under the relevant provisions of the Disciplinary Regulation of the Communist Party of China " , the Inspection Act of the People's Republic of China, considered by the Standing Committee of the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia and reported to the Committee of the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia, the decision was granted to the White Sea to adjust its treatment as required; the collection of proceeds of violations; transferred its alleged criminal issues to the prosecution authorities for prosecution and the transfer of property to the case.
On the afternoon of 25th local time, a small plane crashed on the top of a multi-storey residential building in Weather County, North Wales, Germany, killing three people.
The Duisburg prosecution, Weather County Police and Weather City Fire Department jointly issued a statement that the same night stated that at around 1440 hours, two small aircraft crashed into a multi-storey residential attic on the top of the building on the top of the building on Fabers Camp Street, Weather County, killing three people.
It took off the same day from Mar, Ruar District, North Wales, and took off again after the airport in Weather County, and then hit the residential building.
The victim was or two passengers on a female household and small aircraft in the house that was hit.
One two-year-old in the room was slightly injured and rescued safely.
The rest of the households in the room were not injured in the accident, but the mood was still unrecovered.
The live footage reported by the German News Agency shows that the house in the accident was once out of smoke, and firemen were in serious damage after the fire extinguished the fire.
At present, the reason for the plane crash is unclear.
The Rhine Post quoted police reports that there were leads that the plane was broken up before it hit the building.
Police say there were multiple parts of the plane that crashed were found in the area of the accident.
The German detective is investigating the cause of the accident with prosecution in Duisburg, the German Federal Aviation Accident Investigation Agency.
The journalist learned that the Chinese Consulate General in Dsseldorf that the house had contacted the local police and fire department on the same day, and that there were no Chinese citizens of the casualties.
The Ministry of Health of Singapore announced on 26 days that at 1200 hours that Singapore had added 481 new coronary confirmed cases and 50369 cumulatively confirmed; 27 cumulative deaths.
Data show that five of the new confirmed cases were local community cases, 4 were entered and the rest were foreign workers living in specialized dormitories.
According to the Ministry of Health of Singapore, 98% of new confirmed cases were related to known infections.
There are still 173 new crown patients in hospitals, most of whom are stable or improved, and no one is in intensive care.
In addition, 4648 people are isolated from community facilities.
Foreign workers account for the vast majority of the new coronary infections in Singapore.
According to statistics, 200,000 foreign workers live in 43 foreign workers and about 100,000 foreign workers live in other types of dormitories.
The Singapore Intersectoral Working Group on Anti-Emence has recently indicated that the Singapore Government is increasing its testing of foreign workers with higher rates of infection.
After completing the testing of all specialized dormitories, the vast majority of foreign workers will be able to re-work, but they will still have to conduct new crown tests on a regular basis.
Director Tai Peng, the Golden Lord Award, Xinhua Network.
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival published the official list of the Golden Lords Award.
Director Tai Peng's first reality film, "Good luck," successfully won the Golden Lord Award for the Festival, and the film officially released its first poster.
Posters, squares, maps.
The film "Gyanly" is the first reality piece of director Tai Peng and his second degree of connection with the Golden Lord.
The film tells the story that a comedy director suddenly thought that he returned to his home in the Northeast countryside, hoping to make a family a literary film, and it was a series of accidents.
Family members gathered for film making movies and finished their last party.
In the film poster released today, one of the family, Wang Gyan, sat in the middle of the picture and smoked in the middle of the picture, with the background of the northeast black land in silver, with the future of the Chinese red lanterns that they must hang on on the New Year's Eve.
The red lanterns of the reunion and the king of the fall have formed a huge contrast, and it seems to reveal the complexity and confusion of this family relationship.
It is known that, in the film, apart from the daughter of Wang Jian, Wang Jian, is played by actor Liu Lu, and the rest of the play is done by the real director's family, the experimental audio-visual style of the film, breaking the theatre and the real boundaries, bringing the audience a new immersion experience.
According to director Tai Peng, the creation of "good luck" was created by "a gift" and the sudden family had to change the original film, and life without scripts was finally recorded as a film, but released the tension beyond design.
How can director Tai Peng face this "god" and how can we continue to welcome the changes that this will bring?
There is no doubt that "good luck" is experimental, almost all-American formations and innovative audio-visual styles turn life in front of the camera into a movie, and under the package of real images, the audience will find themselves and their families from the families presented in the film, and as the family meeting falls in the film, it inspires a series of thoughts.
NEWS.GOV.MO: Hotline statistics for the new coronary virus infection response focal point (08H00, 25 July 08H00-26 July)
From 08H00 to July 26, 2020, the hotline for the new coronary virus response focal point received 292 telephone queries.
With regard to 291 queries on the epidemic, it has been immediately transferred to representatives of the relevant departments, as follows:
271 health authorities (involving: search for isolation; search for nucleic acid testing; search for two-ground cards; health code; other.)
17 security police stations (involving: search for entry and exit measures; search for entry and exit measures for vehicles from the two-land vehicle in China; search for the Pearl Sea Government hotline; search for the stay of documents.)
1 Tourism Bureau (involving: search for quarantine hotels.)
1 Education and Youth Bureau (involving: how to find out how Macao students return to England.)
1 Maritime and Water Authority (involving: asking if Hong Kong fishing vessels are required to declare to the Maritime and Water Authority and nuclear acid testing matters.)
Barter Drecon, Long Yu Wang and a soldier on duty.
In this year, at an average temperature of less than a dozen degrees, a simple camp stands at the gate, and a flag is not far away, and soldiers are on duty every day in the wind, and regularly patrol sites at higher altitude.
The soldiers climb up the steep slopes of the rocks and need hands and feet.
In late July, it was when the grass was thick in low altitude, and only in the ditch behind the camp had relatively dense green.
The warriors who have been stationed for six years at the post, pointed to the ditch, saying that this is their back garden, and only in August each year can see the grass slowly grow, and soon after that, all yellow, covered by snow.
On foot patrol, it could take about nine hours.
In the harsh highlands, the soldiers here are always accompanied by snow mountains and glaciers, and they are regularly patrolling at higher altitude.
The other day, a patrol of eight fighters, led by the mentor Liang Ye-Cyan, took the patrol road again.
Each soldier weighs about 30 pounds and goes to the target early in the morning.
A soldier on the way, the comrades were in emergency.
In addition to patrol missions, the soldiers at the Barshocon post are trained in tactics and physical skills every day.
One minute and a second, the altitude is rising, the oxygen content is getting lower and the body is overdrafting, and these factors test the will of the patrol.
They're biting their teeth, they're crossing a few points of collapse, and they're going to cross a few dangerous beaches.
At 1600 hours, the patrolrs had lunchtime, and they took out their own dry food, sitting on the ground of more than 5,700 metres above sea level, with rain and snow, with food to supplement their strength.
The soldiers at the Barthorcon post are training tactical and physical.
During the rest, they play cards, losers do push-ups, entertain and exercise.
After a brief break in the cold wind, they climbed up the patrol target position and took the flag on the hill and solemnly sweared.
Behind them is Mount Mamar, who are dozens of miles ahead of the no-man's area, the safest guardians of the gates.
Beijing consumption season restart - Xinhua Network
Beijing City restarts Beijing consumption season activities according to the principle of "full restart, focus, orderly advance, tight organization".
1.5 million government coupons were issued on July 26, of which 1 million coupons for off-line catering and 500,000 smart product vouchers were issued and consumers were available to the APP in Kyoto.
Liu Mei-young, Deputy Director of the Beijing City Business Bureau, presented at a 25-day media air exchange conference that the post-renewed consumption season further reduced corporate funding on the basis of maintaining the preferential subsidy of existing consumer vouchers.
Since early August, government and business funding is currently adjusted to 2:1, for example, if the original consumer receives a card package to a shop consumption, of which 60 dollars is made for business and $60 for business; 80 dollars for government subsidies and $40 for business.
During the consumption season, three operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting new capital and 5G consumption in Beijing.
Chen Mobo means Hong Kong's economy has been hit again by the outbreak, calling for a difficult time for all sides to live together - the new network.
On July 26th, the Director of Finance of the Hong Kong Special District Government, Chen Mobo, stated that Hong Kong was facing a new wave of coronary pneumonia outbreak, which had been slightly seen by the recovery of commercial transactions and economic activity.
The HKSAR government again calls on owners of all sizes to reduce rent, to work with retailers, food and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Chen Mobo published an article online on the day of the day, entitled "The Path to Recovery."
He said that the recent number of new coronary pneumonia confirmed cases in Hong Kong was high, in a serious situation, affecting the lives of society and the economy.
The first thing in the epidemic is to prevent input cases and to deal with and interrupt the virus transmission chain as quickly as possible; when the epidemic is controlled, economic activity should be restored accordingly.
He noted that, in the face of a new wave of epidemics, there was a slight view of the recovery of business transactions and economic activity.
Social responsibility is equally important for business, beyond the spirit of contract, especially those who receive government benefits in the Employment Insurance Scheme.
He mentioned that the economic situation in Hong Kong remained very serious in the second quarter of this year, but the contraction seemed to slow down slightly.
In terms of exports, he believes that the outer situation in Hong Kong remains serious.
Chen Mobo said Hong Kong's development has shown that every crisis has hidden new opportunities, and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
A winter morning a few years ago, in Johannesburg, South Africa, I drove to work and found the city covered by fog.
I drive through there almost every day, but this time it's unusual, I've never seen anything like it before.
Johannesburg was known for its unique beautiful antenna, but it was almost invisible that morning.
Soon I realized that what I saw was the severe fog caused by air pollution.
The comparison between the beautiful environment I knew and the skyline that was covered by the fog at this moment, was in my heart.
I'm afraid it's possible that the bright sunset of the past will be swallowed by dark fog.
At that moment, I felt a strong impulse, trying to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
All I know is I can't just stand by.
The biggest challenge is that I don't know environmental science, air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer, and I'm pretty sure I can't solve atmospheric pollution by code.
What will I do to solve this problem?
I'm just a small city man.
In the next few years, I've learned a very important lesson, and if we want to achieve a better future, we should all remember it.
Even if you're not an expert in a particular field, your professional skills may have a way to solve that area.
Sometimes, the unique perspective you have can inspire irregular thinking and thus the situation, but you need to try it.
Only then can you know the results.
All I knew was that if I wanted to try to change, I had to know enough about pollution, so I went back to a student.
I did some basic research, and I quickly learned that atmospheric pollution was the world's largest environmental health risk.
According to World Health Organization data, in 2012, almost 14% of deaths worldwide were caused by atmospheric pollution from households and surroundings, especially in low- and middle- and low-income countries.
Atmospheric pollution causes more mortality than malaria and AIDS every year.
In Africa, the premature death of unsafe sanitation, or the death of children's malnutrition, is pale and weak in the face of atmospheric pollution, and it also brings huge economic costs: according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, expenditure in 2013 was over $400 billion.
In my work, I'm looking for the technological frontier of artificial intelligence, including human and machine symbiotic relationships, finding useful points and helping us make better decisions.
When I think about atmospheric pollution, it's very necessary to work together on how to deal with atmospheric pollution, and things become clear, and we need to find better ways to make better decisions, considering the big problem, working together.
So I decided to meet some people who worked in this field.
I started talking to officials in Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, and I joined the local scientific community, and I called some people who were completely strange but related.
I've been working on these experiences that helped me to understand this more deeply.
And it helped me avoid the trap that people in my business try to innovate sometimes fall into a trap: to quickly adopt a technology before they really master the problem.
I started thinking, what can I do to improve this situation?
I started asking myself, how to effectively integrate my knowledge skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence and the professional skills of the people I'm connected to.
I want to create an online air quality management platform to reveal future pollution trends, make projections to determine what might happen.
I'm sure my thoughts can be a realistic solution, but I'm facing uncertainty, and I can't guarantee it's a success.
All I have is a specific set of engineers, the skills I've acquired from my work, of course, for people who have worked in the field of atmospheric pollution for years, my skills are brand new.
I'm beginning to realize that sometimes a new perspective, a new skill mix, can give rise to something extraordinary.
Our willpower and imagination are a sign that shows us to cross the obstacles and open a new chapter.
I've had a deeper understanding of atmospheric pollution, looking for atmospheric pollution data over the past decade, as well as weather data in Johannesburg and surrounding weather data, and then I worked with South African and Chinese colleagues to create air quality resolution support systems and upload them to the clouds.
This software can analyze historical and real-time data to reveal trends in pollution over time and space.
We then used new machine learning techniques to predict future pollution a few days ahead.
That means that residents can make better decisions about their daily journeys and where they settle with their families.
We can predict adverse pollution incidents in advance, define heavy sources of pollution, so that the authorities can give instructions to adjust their operations.
By supporting scenario planning, better decisions can be made by urban planners on how to expand infrastructure, such as housing in industrial zones.
We've built a pre-pilot of the technology, running 120 days, covering the entire South Africa.
Our expected results have been validated, and the predictions we showed close relevance to the data we collected on the ground.
Through our management, we introduced the world's leading cutting edge instruments to predict atmospheric quality, and its resolution and correct rate are unprecedented, so that the city I've been driving into will benefit from the near winter morning... and I said to myself, "Something is wrong, I have to do something."
So the point is, what if I didn't study atmospheric pollution in depth?
What if I don't care about the state of the country, but hope in some places, some other people are in charge of these things?
What I learned from learning is that when we're doing everything we all believe in, it's important to focus on the possibility of success and considering the consequences of inaction.
We should not be distracted by opposition and resistance, it should inspire us to go further.
So wherever you are in the world, next time, when you find out that your natural curiosity is being provoked, and it's about what you care about, you have some crazy or brave ideas, even if it's not your field of expertise, ask yourself: why don't you try it?
Why don't you go straight to solve the problem, do your best, do your best, in your own way?
You might get an unexpected pleasure.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The largest earthquake in the eastern sea of Taiwan this year - China New Network
On July 26th, the Chinese news agency, Taipei, had an earthquake of 6.1 degrees in eastern Taiwan at 2052 hours, with a maximum shock level 4, with a sense of shock, the largest earthquake in the entire country this year.
The earthquake was 86.5 km southeast of the Ilan County Government, the eastern sea of Taiwan, the earthquake, i.e. the eastern sea of Taiwan, 53 km deep.
The Chinese earthquake network measured the earthquake at 5.5.
The largest shock in all locations is: Hana Lin County, Level 4, Yilan County, Taidong County, Nanjin County, Yunlin County, 3rd level, and other counties measured levels 1 to 2.
The Taiwan Meteorological Department has pointed out that the earthquake has been the largest hidden earthquake in the border since this year, and that there have been frequent earthquakes in the past year and has been active since this year.
In the next week, there will be no more than level 4 aftershocks.
Many people think driving is a thing that can only be seen.
The blind want to drive a car safely alone until now, it's considered an impossible task.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we built a car designed for the freedom and independence of the blind.
Before I tell you about this blind car, let me just say briefly another project I've done is called the U.S. Department of Defense High Research and Planning City Challenge.
It's about making a mechanical car that can drive itself.
You press the start button, you don't touch anything, and it can reach its destination completely automatically.
At the 2007 Challenge, our team won $500,000 to get third in the game.
At about that time, the National Blind Association, or the Blind Association, challenged the design team about who could design a car that would allow the blind to drive safely.
We thought we'd try it, because we thought, hey, where would this go?
We've got an automatic car.
We just have to let the blind drive inside, and it's over, right?
But we're not good at it.
The Blind Association wants not a car that can walk around with blind people, but a car that blind can choose and manage.
So we had to give up everything we used to start from scratch.
To test this crazy idea, we designed a prototype car for a small sandcar to test its feasibility.
In the summer of 2009, we invited many blind young people in the country and gave them a chance to take a ride with this car.
It's definitely a cool experience.
But the problem with this car is that it only allows blind people to drive in a very limited environment, like a closed parking lot -- even on a small road made of red traffic cones.
So with this success, we decided to make a real car that can drive on the real road.
How does it work?
Well, it's a relatively complicated system, but let me explain, to simplify it.
We have three stages.
We have sensory stages, computing stages and non-visual interfaces.
The pilot is obviously invisible, so the system must feel the surroundings and collect data for the driver.
That's what we use.
It measures acceleration, angle acceleration -- like human ears, inner ears.
I'm combining this information with GPS to predict where the vehicle is located.
We also use two cameras to detect the path of the car.
We also use three laser rangers.
Laser scans the environment to detect barriers -- from the front, back-to-back vehicles, and any obstacles to break into the road, any barrier around the vehicle.
All the big information goes on to the computer, and the computer does two things.
First of all, one thing is to process information to understand the surroundings -- which are the roadways, the obstacles -- and convert it to the driver.
The system is also very intelligent to figure out the safest route.
We can also issue instructions on how to operate the vehicle.
But the question is: How can we send information and instructions quickly and accurately to the blind to make sure he can drive?
To that end, we have designed a lot of different non-visual user interface technologies.
The original 3D flat sound system, vibrating vests, sound gears, leg belts, even pressured shoes on feet.
But today we're talking about three of these non-visual user interface techniques.
The first interface is called the driver's handle.
It's a pair of gloves, and it has a vibrating element in the section, so you can transmit instructions for how to travel -- direction and range.
Another device is called the speed shock belt.
This chair -- actually, it's a massage chair.
We take it out, we reorganize the vibration elements of different patterns, and we let them transmit speed information, and we also have instructions on how to use the gas doors and brakes.
Here you can see how computers understand the surroundings, because you can't see the vibration, we actually have red light diodes on the driver, so he can see what's happening.
It's sensory data, which is transmitted from sensors to computers.
So these two devices, the driver's handle and speed shock belt, are very effective.
But the problem is, these are the command hints.
So it's not really freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive -- left, right, speed, brakes.
I call it a copilot problem.
So we're avoiding the hint device, and we're more concerned about the information device.
A typical example of this non-visual information interface is called empty maps.
Think of this as a blind monitor.
It's a small desktop, with a lot of holes on it, and compressed air is excluded from it, so it can be described as a picture.
So even if you're blind, you put your hand on it, you can feel the route and the barrier.
In fact, you can change the frequency of release in the air, and it could still be temperature.
It's actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
Here, you can see the left, right cameras and how computers parse and transmit this information to empty maps.
That's it, we're showing a simulation program, a blind man driving with an empty map.
This program is very helpful in training blind drivers and testing different theories based on different types of non-visual user interfaces.
That's basically how it works.
But this car is a model car, and it's not going anywhere unless it's proven to be as safe as it is today, or safer.
I'm sure this is gonna happen.
But does society, can they accept this radical idea?
How do we handle insurance?
How do we issue a driver's license?
There are many different obstacles behind the technical challenge that we need to solve before it really becomes reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a blind car.
But what's more important than that is the enormous value of the by-products in this project.
Sensors that can be used to see darkness, fog.
And this new kind of interface, we can use these technologies to provide safer vehicles for the visible population.
Or for blind people, daily household devices -- educational facilities, office facilities applications.
Imagine, in class teachers write notes on the blackboard, and blind students can use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what teachers write.
It's extremely precious.
Today, what I showed you is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Marinichev says that changes in value are affected by the devaluation of rubles and epidemics.
He said, "The cost of service is increasing.
People began to spend more time on the Internet due to the epidemic. "
Malinichev does not rule out that annual Internet prices will rise significantly, considering that operators can provide clients with higher speed and more services to offset people's dissatisfaction with price increases.
The Chinese doctor is preparing to pay tribute to the anti-prevalence hero, Xinhua Network.
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers against the disease hero, the Chairman of the Bona Film Industry Group, in winter, directed Liu Weiqiang and a member of the Zhong Namshan in Guangzhou, who spoke about the production of the anti-prevalence film "China Doctor".
The Bona Film Industry hopes to pay tribute to all the medical care, disease prevention workers who fought on the front line of the epidemic, by the Chinese doctor!
In 2021, the film will be a national film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party of China.
Currently, the Bona Film Industry is being deployed by the Ministry of China and the National Film Bureau, with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Film Bureau, organized the film "China Captain" by the original Chinese pilot, the Chinese doctor, a film that is reflected in the strong leadership of the party, and the people of the country are united to fight the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
The film focuses on Wuhan's anti-disease line, which will be a character of Wuhan medical personnel and the provincial and municipal aid teams, using unique narratives, and a very powerful lens language, and a full picture of the emotional story of Chinese medical personnel who are dedicated and sacrificed.
It is understood that the first time of Wuhan's release day, Bona has overcome the difficulties and sent a team to go deep into the epidemic, to communicate face to face with hundreds of medical workers, to gather information, and have now interviewed the first-hand video of the anti-disease line, including Zhong Namshan, Guangzhou to assist Wuhan First, and the Guangdong Aido Medical Team, and Wuhan Kim and Silver Hospital, Wuhan University Central Hospital, Wuhan University Hospital, and the most advanced white-dressed angels on the front line of the Wuhan Center Hospital.
The Zhong Namshan Academy also offered expectations and hopes for film film production at this symposium: "I look forward to visiting not only some experts who show up, but also to interview more medical personnel who were working hard on the front line, and that they were most of them. "
He said he'd seen "Me and my country" "China Captain" and thought it was a good way to tell the big story from a normal human perspective.
"Some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China. "
When it comes to the spread of the film, a member of Zhong Namshan said that some people abroad like to label the virus, and he wants the film to impress the audience from a human perspective: "This film is better to be shown abroad, in a way that is understood by both domestic and foreign audiences. "
Zhong Namshan also remembered the film "Man to Middle Age" in the 1980s, "All these years have passed, and I'm impressed with the movie after reform and opening up, when my doctors and friends from abroad were crying, and it would be amazing if the Chinese doctor could do that."
Zhong Namshan said that if the Chinese doctor could resonate with the foreign audience, it would be very successful.
In the conversation, the Zhong Namshan Academy shared views and suggestions on the current international epidemic control, "I believe that people are always smarter than the virus."
According to Zhong Namshan, while the virus is unpredictable, humans have been in danger from the original society, and that today there are developed medical technology and social management measures in modern society, and even medical personnel around the world, even the people of the world have a basic understanding of science in response to the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, and that people will not be as passive as they were before, "and then to look at two aspects, one to study how the world can strengthen cooperation, and the second focus on the comfort of people."

The Man Brigade "Red Fruit" is a collection of the first Red Bo meeting.
Hunan Daily, New Hunan client journalist, Chiang Wie, Correspondent, Shaw Yan
The Ka Xing Red Boat Moot, the Mao Zedong Copper Image, the Yananbu flower shop, Xinxi Yongsoon meat... 25 July, the 2020 Hunan Red Tour Cultural Festival opened in Shangshan.
As one of the main events, the first Red Cultural Industry Fair was held at the Shangshan Global Tourism Advisory Centre.
The exhibition area's red creation, the old revolution's Tut products, etc., led to tourists everywhere to buy.
" This Red Fair is both a demonstration of the results of the red cultural industry in the country and an important platform for the exchange of experiences among exhibitors and businesses to explore the path of development ... "
The head of the first Red Fair Executive Committee introduced the Red Fair, which focused on the theme "To promote the heat-up of the Red Culture Promotion Brigade", with an exhibition of nearly 3,000 square metres, with an atmosphere-building area, a view area showing the exhibition area and the Red Mannet network.
Zhejiang Ka-hyun, Guizhou, eight foreign provinces and 137 enterprises, such as Changsha, Jiazhou, Yueyang, Chuzhou, Chuzhou, and others, 768 exhibits, including red cultural objects, crafts, food specialty, tourist routes, red training courses, red creative products, etc.
The exhibition area will be displayed until July 29th.
As host of the Red Fair, the bright spots of the show.
The director of the exhibition area introduced that the exhibition was divided into the red industry, and the red cultural industry was developing in two parts.
The red industrial exhibition area displays 31 exhibits from six companies such as the Walling Steel, the Warring cable, the electric power, and the Red Cultural Industry Development Fair, the red series of books, the red series of foods, the red series of creative products, and nearly 200 products.
In the Yanan area, many tourists were attracted to the display of flower crafts and paper cutting art.
The director of the Yanan City Cultural Brigade, Ma Dongpo, presented the exhibition carefully selected the excellent red creation product of Yanan for the last two years, 16 of which were excellent works of the 2019 national red creation product.
At the same time, they invited the National Intangible Cultural Heritage Conservation Project, Anse Paper Cut, the "Singing North Min Song" and the provincial non-removable project Yanchuan canvas, focusing on the Yenan folk specialty product and took the opportunity to communicate with other exhibition area enterprises to promote cross-regional cooperation.
Japan has over 30,000 cases of new crown confirmed cases - Xinhua Network
According to statistics, 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on 26 days, more than 200 new cases per day for six days, cumulatively 11214.
In addition, 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Province, 90 new cases in Fukuoka County and 80 new Aichi County.
In the first half of the year, telecommunications cyber-fraud crime rose by 70%, the highest inspection summary feature - the new network.
According to the Supreme Inspection website, 58101 people were sued by the National Prosecution Service in the first half of this year, an increase of 35 per cent over the same period.
In particular, the number of fraud offences committed by the prosecution authorities account for 43.4 per cent of the total number of perpetrators against the epidemic.
The Supreme People ' s Procuratorate has targeted guidance and has now published nine of the 10 typical cases involving fraud.
From the first half of the year, there are many names involving fraud offences, up to national macro-policy, to the national macro-policy, to the ground, including epidemic fraud, "health care" fraud, "health care" fraud, "admission broker" fraud, "road loan" fraud, fraud against State subsidies, national assets unfrozen fraud, etc., constantly "showing new" covering education, medical care, employment, old age, social security, land demolition, precision poverty reduction, financial credit, etc., which not only causes economic losses to victims, but also seriously affecting economic social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network fraud breaks national boundaries, geographical and personnel restrictions, with characteristics such as crowd-related, cross-border, remote, electronic payments, and are not specific to the victim group.
For example, there are specialized companies that rent high-end writing buildings, multiple departments or posts, use legitimate web platforms to promote, recruit, train and evaluate recruiters, manage business models, wear "legal coats" and be more confusing.
It is the duty of the prosecution authorities to punish and prevent crime in accordance with the law and to warn the public and the relevant authorities in a timely manner.
In the case of justice, the prosecution authorities have performed their duties carefully, insisting on maintaining high pressure on fraud crimes and targetedly detailed law enforcement initiatives, promoting social governance through the development of prosecution recommendations.
The prosecution has strictly shut down the arrest, prosecution of fraud cases, evidence, procedural and legal application, based on facts, and is based on the law, and is based on the law, and is not in vain.
In particular, for telecommunications cyber-fraud, focus on the central role of electronic data in fact-identification, efforts to build electronic data, evidence of statements and evidence between documents.
If a case of disease fraud is handled by the District Procuratorate of Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, the prosecution service intervenes early, from the case to the closure of the case, with only five days, reflecting the attitude and determination to maintain stability in the social landscape.
In the review of the arrest and review of prosecutions, the case-oriented prosecution process, correcting the leakage of 733 persons by the public security authorities and 1113 persons for prosecution.
In the first half of the year, the National Prosecution Service issued 298 prosecution recommendations on fraud, promoting working together to prevent fraud and promote deep governance.
For example, in response to gaps in telecommunications network regulation, such as communications enterprises, banks, intermediaries, etc., the Guangdong Province Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the East Province Public Prosecutor ' s Office, urged the relevant units to strengthen regulation and improve mechanisms and contribute to the construction of a long-term system.
Four is to do the recovery.
The prosecution authorities have seized important elements such as intervention in the investigation and reviewing prosecutions, urged the investigative authorities to actively pursue stolen money and to work with the authorities to recover the theft and to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud to the population.
In the case of a road loan package conducted by the Beijing Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the case involves 22 production wheels waiting to be sealed and that, in case of possible other cases, the creation of a "suspensive execution letter" was issued to the relevant court in a timely manner, recommended that the court had previously seized the provisional execution of the property involved, pending the identification of the facts of the crime, making the greatest effort to recover the victim's losses.
The prosecutor reminds you of being very vigilant about fraud, not to expect "the pies in the sky" and not to be cheap, keep your own money bag.
The town of Xinna, Weining County, Guizhou: Short apple trees, wideed the road out of poverty - the new net.
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: China Economic Network by Zhu Yanjing Responsible Editor: Zhu Yanjing
Hot summer inflammation, economic daily, Chinese economic network journalists entered the town of China Hai village, Weining County, Guizhou.
On the back of the sun, the villagers Lee Won-chul were grassing in the base, and although it was red, but he was singing a little song from time to time.
Weining County, where the town is located, is low latitude, high altitude, light, high temperature, high sugar, good taste, and has a certain visibility in the surrounding area, but because of its small head, with a lot of spots, has not been able to sell a good price, and it has not been able to make an industry size.
The town of Xinna was a poor town of "Cau Valley Potato Spring and Autumn", with a local poverty incidence of 25.8 per cent 10 years ago.
In a critical period of the fight against poverty, changing traditional planting habits, adjusting industrial structures and increasing farmers' income is imminent.
After several visits, the Secretary of the town's party committee, Chen Xue and a group of people in town, believe that industrial development can no longer go the old way.
To that end, the town of Xinna introduced the lead company to grow apples in a modern way.
Weining went beyond Hu Jianwen, Deputy General Manager of Agriculture Limited, from Shaanxi to the town of Xinxi in 2015, looking at local conditions for planting apples from 2016 to local apple trees.
At first, the village mobilized Lee Won-chung to turn the land out to plant apple trees, and the Lee Won-chongs made a grunt in their hearts: "For years, I didn't see anyone growing apples in the village. "
"The apples are short apples, and they don't grow too high."
What makes Li Yuanzhong wonder that this apple plant uses a new method to lay under every apple tree, water and fertilizer pour it to the roots, and when the fruit is collected in the fall, the tractor goes straight into the orchard and picks the fruit.
Apple Base is now gradually entering the production period, and the market is also sold, as Hu Jianwen expected, and is very popular with urban consumers like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc.
The growing apple industry has changed Lee Won-chung's life, and although still growing, has a new source of income.
Lee Won-chung's family has over nine acres of land flowing to Apple Base, and every year, in addition to the bottom land transfer fee, there's a profit-sharing score, and the couple usually works at the base, "80 dollars a day, and he's always working."
Lee Won-chung told reporters that last year's profit split was over 2,800, plus land flow fees and the income of the couple's workers, a family income of 80,000, "Eat through, and Kang's life is over."
"It is now beginning to work, with an annual value of over 15,000 acre of apples, about 10 times the amount of corn. "
Chen Xue told reporters that the town currently planted 20,000 acres of apples, 6,000 acres in Central Hai village alone, covering 4056 farmers, 172 million, covering 656 families in the construction of a card poor family, 2952 people, paid more than $6 million a year, and actually achieved the base building at home, and that work was not to go out.
Lee Won-chul, who is growing up in his waist, has begun to realize his wish.
This year, Li Won-chung bought a Land Cruiser, and now he's driving a car and leaving work every day, "There's a dozen acres of land at home, and when the next apple base expands, it's all going to be transferred to them, and the income is more."

New hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology diagram
The journalist's company, Swe, reported that the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team of Tianjin University made significant progress towards the "film separation capture CO2" and successfully developed new hybrid base membrane preparation techniques to significantly improve the CO2 capture performance of membrane materials.
The results have been published as a cover article in the international journal Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology.
The greenhouse effect is a major environmental problem that plagues human development, and CO2 emissions are the killers of greenhouse effects.
How to efficiently capture and use human emissions of CO2 is the focus of scientists' attention.
The membrane separation method is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology that separates CO2 gases with the help of membrane materials, with efficient energy efficiency and simple operational characteristics.
How to make the membrane material "deep breath" and improve gas separation efficiency is difficult to capture carbon dioxide by membrane separation.
The scientific team at Tianjin University has innovative ideas to explore the effects of different solvents on membrane gas separation through repeated experiments.
The results of the experiment show that the distribution of carbon nanopipes in film materials generated by N-methylacne as a solvent is more evenly distributed, "more air-resilient" and effectively increases the separation and rate of membrane material gas separation.
The hybrid matrix film prepared with this new technology is close to the theoretical separation limit of such membrane materials.
" New technologies provide new ideas for membrane separation to capture carbon dioxide ... "
Lee Yun, a member of the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team of Tianjin University, said: "We hope this technology will provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies to deal with flue gas and play a significant role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions.

Before you volunteer to fill in, you know what a professional difference is.

Before you volunteer to fill in, you know what's a professional difference.
Every year, students or parents are informed of the terms involved in the voluntary filing, and thus affect voluntary filing.
This year, Beijing University of Transport, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing Post and Telecommunications University, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing Chemical University 5 universities jointly issued a 2020 admission policy to eliminate professional differences.
What does professional differential mean, what is the importance of voluntary filing?
There are three ways to assign professional rules.
Experts remind that before you fill in the volunteer school, you must read the admission rules of higher education, including the transfer ratio, the rules of professional distribution, etc.
Professional allocation rules, which refer to professional priority, with a priority for professional admission, with three ways of differential professional admission.
Which way does the college use, it's clear in the admission charter.
But there are also some principles for admission to higher education, with no difference between professions.
That means that the candidates in the range of admissions are lined according to the total, and when the scores do not reach the first professional voluntary admission score line, see whether the second professional voluntary admission score line is reached, so that there is no difference between professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional difference" is one or more points published by the admission charter by the admission charter to determine the admission to different professional candidates, which is a "professional difference".
That is the difference between the scores of the first professional and non-first professional volunteers, the difference between the number of professional volunteers, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example.
Assuming that the student ' s examination for A higher education, 560 points were given, their professional volunteers were: computers, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, professional admissions to A colleges, with a difference of 2 points, 1 point, 0 points.
At the time of professional distribution, if the first professional volunteer for the first professional voluntary examination meets the professional admission requirements and has planned balances, he is admitted to the "computer" profession; if the computer is not admitted, his score will be reduced by two points, and the score will be sorted in the order of 558 points in the first professional voluntary examination of "International Trade" and determine whether it is met; if it is still not met, the score will be reduced by one point (i.e. 557) for the third professional voluntary "automation" admission; if it is still not met, the score is reduced by one point (i.e. 556) for the fourth professional admission, and the follow-up profession, if it is not met, so on.
Different university professional differences
With the spread of parallel volunteers, many higher education institutions have now cancelled their professional differences, but some universities still have retained this method this year, and in terms of the "Regrolment Charter" published by the schools, there are more than 20 universities that have established professional differences this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Technology, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Technology, Jiangxi Teacher Training University, Chengdu Medical School, Northeast Electricity University, Central American University of Medicine, Nanjing Industrial University, Ningxia University, Shandong Polytechnic University, China Civil Aviation Flight College, etc.
In these colleges, the professional differences in each university are different.
Some colleges have grade differentials in every profession, such as Ningxia University, where the files have been put to candidates who have been enrolled in the order of one point of the examination to fill in the professional volunteer order.
And some universities have different professional differences between different professions.
For example, the total professional voluntary difference is 4 points, i.e. the difference between first professional volunteering and other professional volunteering, and no difference between other professional volunteers, considered parallel volunteers, and one in other professional volunteers.
When you report volunteers, candidates and parents must read carefully the admission policy of the reported school, see if there is a professional difference and what is the form of a difference, while fully considering the scores, you have to rationally analyse the proposed schools and professions, and if the institution explicitly adopts the grade differentials in the admission charter, and the candidates should be aware of the gradient between professions and increasing the chances of admission.

The big media operation, "Go to the Village Live and Watch Out of Poverty."
On July 25th, Hunan Daily News, New Hunan client, was launched on July 25th, a large media operation hosted by the Central Radio and Television General Financial Program Center, "Swam Village Lives Out of Poverty" from Jiangsu Xuzhou, and two cape vehicles with 5G new media mobile cloud broadcasting systems were sent down and slowly out of the scene.
General Secretary Xi said, "2020 is a landmark year, and we will fully build a small society, achieve the first hundred-year struggle goal, and 2020 is the year of the fight against poverty."
The big media campaign "Ride Village Lives and Watching Poverty" is an important initiative for the Central Radio and Television General Financial Program to complement this major theme and to promote poverty.
The operation will enter more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, to dig up stories of living out of poverty, to hit the huge changes in the village's face and show how villagers can break through their survival and development and move towards wealth.
This operation will last more than three months.
Journalists are leaving Xuzhou, two roads, heading south-west, via Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet, and so on; the other road goes north-west, via Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei, etc., and so on.
In the form of the story, "Going Village Lives to Watch Out of Poverty" boldly integrated.
The economic development of the garage to the village will be broadcast through the Central Radio and Television Station, the Voice of the Economy, the Chinese Traffic Radio, the New Media for Finance.
Among them, live television will be completed mainly on the midday news programme "The World of the World" (first broadcast: Monday to Sunday, 12 noon-13:00), and the Golden News column on the Financial Channel, Economic Information, will open a column on poverty eradication (first broadcast: Monday to Sunday, 2030-21:30).
Meanwhile, the cart will broadcast an hour of live coverage of each village in the financial and financial clients, and the audience will be able to watch the live broadcast and participate in the lottery by downloading the financial app.
In technology applications and studio design, "The Village Live Watch Out of Poverty" was a breakthrough, and the first "New Media Car" was created.
The car carries 5G new media mobile cloud broadcasting system, using 5G+4K/8K+AI technology to achieve organic integration of online, large screens, television broadcasting.
Configure the three-time broadcast area, which is modified by containers, 12 metres long, 2.55 metres wide, 3.98 metres high, and the box is automatically expanded with hydraulics, with a maximum of 120 degrees.
The studio can also be automatically expanded and the outside extension platform, which covers over 50 square metres, meets the requirements of most programmes.
The Eastgawa district of Kunming is now summer inflammation, and it's hotter than the weather, and it's easy to move to poverty reduction workshops by the placement point.
Lu Ling, an employee of Kunming Esford Electronics, said, "Now, as soon as you leave the house, you go to the factory and make money, thanks to the free vocational skills training organized by the union. "
Walking into the copper street electronics processing workshop in Dongchuan District, a busy picture of the sky is showing the curtains.
Lu Ling, in his 40s, was a single mother, with a child and a child, and he took care of his old parents.
In her hardest time, the Eastgawa General Union helped to figure out a way to get to the snow before she ran.
Since 2018, Lu Ling has been receiving assistance from housing, study, social security, employment, etc., policy and trade unions at all levels.
This year, her children have graduated and employed successfully, and she herself has a job and income after her skills training, and has been out of trouble at the end of April.
According to the information received, the General Organization of the Tokugawa Region has helped to combat poverty and to build a dedicated skill training project as part of the general trade union skills training in Yunnan Province.
The region, in conjunction with the characteristics of workers in the region ' s vulnerable relocation point, has investigated in-depth surveys of training needs, identifying training workers, recent plans to train electricians, welders, facemen, etc.
Recently, Li Yi, a member of the Bank of Agriculture, Yunnan Menglian County Branch, wrote a true letter of gratitude to the county general union.
In her letter, she sincerely thanked her for helping her finish her studies between August 2013 and January 2017, the union gave her a grant to help her finish her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi ' s father died in a car accident and her mother was included in the staff files of difficult workers and has since been given care for the security card policy.
With the help of the local union, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, 3809 families have been achieved through institutional safeguards and precision assistance.
The success of the Lu Ling family and Li Yi is a microcosm of the Yunnan Union's promotion of difficult workers.
According to the staff section of the Ministry of Law and Defence of the General Trade Union of Yunnan Province, the province has strengthened the dynamic management of the files of difficult workers, promoting the normalization of the placement process, and the timely integration of the support system for difficult workers; broadening access to difficult workers and using micro-credit to apply for difficult staff to build up a platform to facilitate timely and proactive declaration by hard workers.
