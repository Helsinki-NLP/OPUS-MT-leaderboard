According to the British media, Admiral William Moran, Deputy Secretary of Operations of the United States, even if the United States Navy was rejuvenating its forces to respond to increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States continued to expand the Asia Pacific - Pentagon to include the Indian Ocean-Asia-Pacific - as a naval focus.
According to the British Jane Defense Weekly website, September 24, the United States listed China and Russia as a strategic rival in the new defense strategy published early in the year.
Since then, the U.S. Navy resumed its second fleet to fight Russia more directly.
Reports say that these moves raise some questions and concerns among allies and analysts who fear that the United States Navy may stay away from the Obama administration's Asia-Pacific rebalance strategy.
But Admiral Moran said the U.S. Navy's focus remains on the Western Pacific Ocean.
At a round table discussion organized by the National Asian Research Agency of the United States on 24 January 2018 in Washington, D.C., he said, " No significant change has occurred for us. "
Moran said, " The focus is still rebalanced, focused on moving or whatever you want to describe it ... "
But he admits that the United States is close to Europe.
He said, " We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do ... "
While Moran pointed out that the overall policy on Russia was within the terms of reference of the United States Secretary of Defense, he warned that " Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, history has proven that if we conflict with them, they will be very tough ... "
Admiral Moran said that as part of the re-emergence operation of the United States against Russia, China and other competitors, the United States Navy is rapidly deploying troops into a "new mode of combat " , which will help to get the opponent to the American carrier battle base or other assets at any given time and location.
He said, " We Navy and Marines support it - the concept of combat unpredictableness, not to appear in the same place over and over again, almost like a hairline -- that's our approach. "
According to reports, the first attempt to do this new approach was the Harry Truman carrier battle group, which included an early deployment of the battle group, which included working visits to ports and patrolling areas that were usually only passed.
Moran said that the United States Navy is currently working to ensure that allies know that these ships will still patrol in traditional areas and are still addressing logistical and family liaison issues for new deployment procedures.
Lieutenant General Michael Nunan, Commander of the Royal Australian Navy, also addressed the event, saying that the Australian army could work seamlessly with the American carrier combat community.
He said that this would continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to purchase nine more frigates equipped with the Zeus Shield combat system.

On November 5, the People's Network, Beijing, under the current wave of popular entrepreneurship, innovation, has begun to focus on patent research and development and related protection, deep into the potential value of patents and dominates market ownership.
Similarly, many technology companies have experienced a lot of violations in patent technology authorization, patent technology use, etc.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, Ho Zhanghong, Rybin, the developer of the "dip-trip" APP developer, Beijing Orange Technology Ltd. (hereinafter known as Orange Technology), operator dripping Technology Ltd. (hereinafter known as drip trip), seller Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) v. Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three accused immediately cease the manufacture, sale, the promise of sale, the use of the plaintiff's patent.
On 30 October 2018, the China Network of Judges published the first instance of a civil decision against patent disputes against inventions such as Tan Wei, Ho Zhanghong and Beijing Orange Technology Ltd., which disclosed some of the details of the cases in which the drop-trip APP was charged with patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs believe that patent holders and inventors based on mobile terminal carpool services and methods, while the entire course of operation of the "dip trip" windmill application, which corresponds to the technology programme involved in patent protection, constitutes patent infringement.
However, during the court decision, Orange Technology considered that the Guangdong Pacific was not a suitable defendant and provided a free download of the APP "dip trip" on the Internet alone, without the patent method, and that there was no direct or indirect violation and should not be listed as the defendant in this case.
Second, the violation in this case is not in Guangdong.
According to the law, the violation of the patent in question shall be in place where the patent method is fully implemented and therefore challenged the jurisdiction of the Court, requesting the transfer of the case to the accused's residence court, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific had provided an APP product on its web platform, and that the plaintiff had listed the defendant Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
And the defendant is located in Guangzhou City, under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant Orange Technology advocated the transfer of the case to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court, and, on the basis of insufficientness, rejected the objection of the defendant ' s jurisdiction to the jurisdiction of the case and to bear the costs of receiving the case of jurisdiction.
Other proceedings in the case are not yet published and journalists will also follow closely the follow-up details of the drop-trip patent torts.
Visit to the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research: significant results in science and technology cooperation in Australia
" China ' s science and technology has grown rapidly over the past few decades, with the two countries working together in the scientific field to achieve great results ... "
Larry Marshall, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research, recently received an interview with the Chinese News Agency journalist in Beijing that cooperation with the Skyeye project had demonstrated a dynamic experience in cooperation with the Skyeye project.
As the largest national scientific institution in the Federation of Australia, CSIRO has achieved a wide range of innovative research results in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials, astronomy, etc.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"This is a lasting friendship, which contains a tradition of trust and long-term cooperation of partners ... " Marshall says.
In May this year, China ' s 500-metre spherical radio telescope - China Skyeye installed the first international 19 beam L-band receiver.
This is currently the most advanced 19 beam feeder in the world, developed jointly by Central Australian scientists.
Marshall stated that the successful development of the receiver was based on the accumulation of technology over the years of CSIRO, and that the FAST tour would increase by five to six times, while expanding more scientific observation targets.
"This is a force of CSIRO's contribution to the FAST. "
In addition to the above cooperation, CSIRO is working closely with Chinese scientific institutions in building square kilometres of array radio telescopes, developing new fuel technologies, energy-saving emission reductions, etc.
" Past scientific research has often focused on a hundred years later, and more scientific power is needed to solve the problems before them ... "
Marshall believes that the two countries of Australia are complementary in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a range of challenges in development.
For example, extreme weather is frequent globally, drought and floods have led to food reduction and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, population explosions, ageing, chronic diseases, etc. are serious challenges currently facing.
" The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused primarily on addressing these current challenges ... "
Marshall described the International Southern Ocean Research Centre, which CSIRO and the National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology of Qingdao, whose focus was on observing the El Nino phenomenon and the Ramina phenomenon, to study the relationship between the two and extreme weather and to establish early warning facilities for extreme weather; and the new species of grain to overcome extreme weather, which could also mitigate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
" In the current environment, science, technology and innovation are difficult to do alone, require very high costs and very many problems to be addressed, so cooperation is particularly important today ... "
Marshall says that the closer cooperation is likely to make breakthroughs, which is also the point of strengthening cooperation between Australia and China within the framework of "one way."
" Strengthening bilateral cooperation is primarily scientific and technological cooperation for us ... "
Marshall, for example, CSIRO has recently developed a gold purity that does not use cyanide, which is very dangerous to the environment because traditional cyanide gold purification is very dangerous, and many countries want to find a way to clean gold with small environmental pollution.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology into China, one of the results of our participation in the "Away" cooperation. "

On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Affairs Minister Li Yong Ho stated to the United Nations that the continued sanctions had deepened North Korea's lack of confidence in the United States and that it could not give up nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Lee Yong Ho stated at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had adopted a "very friendly approach " over the past year, including the cessation of missiles and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and committed itself to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we didn't see any corresponding responses in the United States," he said.
" Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such cases we cannot give up weapons unilaterally ... "
Although Lee Yong-ho repeats North Korea's complaints against the United States of America's "phased" denuclearization, his speech was of great significance, because it was not completely rejected to denuclearize unilateralization, as North Korea did before.
Lee Yong Ho mentioned Kim Jong-un and Trump's joint statement of June 12, when Kim Jong-un agreed to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, and Trump committed to protecting North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking to officially end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States claims that North Korea must abandon nuclear weapons first.
The United States also refused to ease the demand for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on " denuclearization " and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve its purpose in a high pressure manner, and even refuse to publish the " End of War Declaration", " Lee Yong Ho claims.
"Thinking that sanctions can make us kneel and beg for forgiveness is not aware of our people having a daydream.
But the problem is that this continuing sanctions are deepening our trust ... "
Lee Yong-ho didn't mention the second Tucking plan that the President of the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he stressed that Kim Jong-un and Korean President Wen met three times over the past five months and stated: " If the other side of denuclearization was Korea, not North Korea, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not become so rigid ... "
China announced a reduction of import tariffs for 1585 tax purposes as of 1 November 2018.
Since this year, China has been taking the initiative to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1, this year, the total tax reduction on medicines was adjusted to zero for 28 tax purposes, including anti-cancer drugs, all generic drugs and anti-cancer bioalkali drugs, with actual imports of Chinese medicine, etc.
At the same time, it has significantly reduced the production of anti-cancer drugs and the import chain VAT tax.
1 July tax cuts on 218 tax-purpose cars and spare parts.
After tax cuts, China's whole car tax rate is lower than the average in developing countries and is in line with the actual Chinese automobile industry.
This tax reduction will drive industry restructuring and resource optimization and resource optimization, accelerate success and poorness, and will help improve the quality of products and services and is expected to some extent promote car price adjustment and increase consumer benefits.
On 1 July, the daily consumer goods were reduced for 1449 tax purposes.
Daily consumer tax cuts are linked to the needs of the good lives of the people.
This tax reduction is not only large but strong, but the average tax reduction is 56%.
Daily consumer tax cuts, which directly benefit a wide range of consumers and promote competitiveness in domestic industries.
Tax cuts will be imposed on 1 November for industrial goods such as 1585 tax-purpose electrical and electrical equipment, spare parts and raw materials.
Appropriate reduction of import tariffs on some of the countries that are in need of industrial goods can attract more foreign investment, contribute to increasing domestic effective supply and upgrading, while helping enterprises to allocate resources globally, reduce production costs and reduce domestic environmental carrying pressures.
The relevant heads of the Office of the Customs and Tax Regulations Committee of the State Council of China introduced the four autonomous tax cuts and the third step reduction implemented on 1 July this year under the expansion of the information technology agreement, which would reduce China ' s total tariff levels from 9.8 per cent to 7.5 per cent in the previous year.
The overall adjusted tariff level is slightly higher than the EU, lower than most developing countries, at a medium- and low level, largely matching the status and development phase of China ' s developing countries.
The head described the overall tariff level as one of the important indicators of openness in the area of goods trade in China, which should be adapted to China ' s economic development phase and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China ' s trade in goods is first in the world, with an open economic base, but there is still a gap in the quality and benefits of trade development compared to developed economies, and therefore the overall tariff level should be properly reduced.
Customs duties are a means of compliance, and tariff levels should be adapted to industrial competitiveness, encouraging good competition, excessive protection is not conducive to industrial development and quality improvement.
The tariff rate adjustment takes into account production needs and consumption needs.
The focus is on reducing domestic demand and upgrading the commodity tax rates that contribute to industrial transformation, efforts to increase the import of special advantages of people ' s demand, increasing access to businesses and the public, meeting the need for upgrading industrial and consumer structures.
Tax cuts balance the sustainability of fiscal revenues and industrial development.
The choice of specific tax cuts and tax reductions should be integrated and coordinated between two markets in both domestic and foreign markets, both upstream and downstream, production and consumption, and maintaining the steady momentum of China ' s economy.
The head stressed that this year was the fortieth anniversary of reform and opening up, and that China ' s initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major initiative based on China ' s own high-quality development needs, which will facilitate the integrated use of two resources from international and foreign countries to promote the quality of domestic supply systems and meet the needs of people ' s consumption upgrading.
This action and initiative shows that China will continue to pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy, strongly support economic globalization, strongly uphold the principles of free trade and the multilateral trading system at the heart of the WTO, and continue to draw development dynamics from opening up to the world, and to make China more beneficial to the world.

Wulin stressed that Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as the orders issued by Wuchchi remain in force, and that the SLA will respond in any direction that goes.
According to the Russian Tas Society, on 29 September, Vuchchi stated that he had informed the current situation with all parties such as the United States and Russia and would travel to Moscow to meet with Russian President Putin on 2 October to seek Putin's support on Kosovo.
When asked whether Serbia needed Russian military support like Syria, Wuchchi answered no: " I do not want to have a major military conflict on our territory ... "
Wuchchi also stated that the Soviet army was in full-scale operational readiness only to create a deterrent to prevent the occurrence of the conflict, but it was also a clear warning that no violence would be tolerated in Kosovo.
The reasons for raising their operational readiness are related to two major actions in Kosovo.
According to the Serbian side, Albanians have recently been arresting Serbs living in the northern part of Kosovo for generations, which have not violated any laws.
Vuchchi states that since Marko Yurich, head of the offices of the Government of Serbia in Kosovo and Metohija on 26 March this year, the Albanians have been upgrading the regional situation and has carried out inhuman arrest and expulsion of Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 people, such as the ROSU Special Forces of the Internal Affairs Department of the Republic of Kosovo, have occupied positions near the water storage lake at the Gazivoda hydroelectric plant, entering the ecological and sports centres near the dam in the northern Kosovo region and blocked all roads nearby, which were previously controlled by the Serbian side.
Vuchchi noted that this military adventure in Kosovo was carried out with the encouragement of Western countries, and that the actions of the Kosovo army had not informed Serbia in advance, in violation of chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement and the military technical agreement between United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 and Sekko.
Vuchchi has spoken to NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg to criticize Western countries for hypocrisy on Kosovo.
The root cause of this conflict remains a historical complaint between the Serbs in the Kosovo region for centuries.
There are different statements of Kosovo ' s belonging to Kosovo, Serbs and Albanians.
Serbia sees Kosovo as a national and cultural cradle, as Serbia built its strongest country here in the 12th century, and Albanians moved in a large number of times after the invasion of the Ottoman Empire and the defeat of the Cypriot army.
The Albanians insist that the original tribe Ilya, who lived in Kosovo in the 4-5th century B.C., was the ancestors of Albanians, and that Kosovo was an Albanian territory since ancient times.
Subjective political divisions create intense conflicts between different peoples, religions and cultures, causing intense confrontation between Serbs and Albanians in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, the Kosovo Albanians first declared Albanian independence.
After World War I, a large number of Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, with the proportion of Serbs relatively rising, and in the view of Serbs, "just taking their own land back", was seen by the Albanians as looting "the great Serbianism" and the bicommunism.
Kosovo became the " gunpowder drum " in the Balkans.
In 1999, armed conflict between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Southern Union of Serbia and Montenegro by NATO forces, and the outbreak of war in Kosovo.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo declared its unilateral independence from Serbia.
Since then, it has been reported that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, agreements that are subject to multiple forces such as the United States and Russia have not been signed because of historical national complaints and geopolitical constraints.
And just a month ago, Vuchchi made it clear for the first time that it advocated the isolation of Serbs from Albanians in Kosovo and that the conflict between the two communities was once again publicized.
Electricity communications are still off. Indonesia's earthquake with tsunami rescue is in a lot of trouble.
According to figures published by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early hours of the 30th morning, the strong earthquake and the tsunami caused by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the province of Sulawesi, in the country, had killed 420 people.
According to WilemRampangilei, head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, this figure is only preliminary statistics from Palu, Central Sulawesi Province, about 80 km from the earthquake, which has not been searched and rescued because of the lack of large search and rescue machinery, many hotels, malls, warehouses, etc. in the city due to the lack of large search and rescue machinery.
On September 29, 2018, local time, a bridge destroyed by earthquakes and tsunamis, Indonesia, was broken into several sections.
As a result of severe damage to electricity and communications facilities, the earthquake was still unconnected to date, and the number of victims was unable to count the number of victims.
In this media report, Vice President Kara of Indonesia claims that the number of deaths or thousands of deaths.
The power is broken, the traffic is broken, the airport is damaged... and the rescue after the tsunami is difficult.
As a result of the interruption of electricity, some hospitals and rescue sites in Palu City need to be powered by fuel.
The road into and out of the city was blocked by the landslides and the lack of access to large transport vehicles, including tankers, making fuel supply very tense.
According to Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs, Agus, the Ministry had not yet arrived in the affected areas by emergency relief supplies such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothing, food, household kits, etc., from South Sulawesi and Columbus Provinces, near the earthquake zone.
Disaster relief materials transferred from Jakarta, the capital, are being transported through air force transport aircraft to disaster areas.
Given the damage to the Palu airport command tower and runway in the earthquake, all commercial flights have been suspended to ensure safety and security, all commercial flights have been suspended only for military aircraft carrying relief supplies and personnel.
The Indonesian Political, Legal and Security Integrated Minister for Legal and Security in the earthquake zone, Veranto, requested that electricity supply and airport commercial flight services be restored as soon as possible to ensure the operation of rescue agencies such as hospitals, allowing more rescue workers and volunteers to assist supplies to the disaster zone.
On 28th, several strong earthquakes occurred in the district of Donggara, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, of which the 7.7-grade earthquake at 1702 local time triggered a tsunami, causing a major disaster in Palu, Dangara County, Westji region.
Beijing has been opening the most beautiful blue sky model recently, leading thousands of people on social platforms to be happy on the continuous screen, called "The Blue Sky Cloud, "Drink" American Skyline, which is the best business card in Beijing.
Since August, Beijing has been in the blueest sky.
In the capital, people can see people anywhere or with smartphones or take pictures of a single back camera.
Weibo, Weibo, Wisdom Friends, etc., are everywhere in the home of the Internet, Tiananmen, bird nests, all kinds of buildings show different beauty under the blue sky.
Some of the netizens say that this "large film" is the best city propaganda film in Beijing; and the netizens say that if such a blue sky is painted long, people with neck vertebrae can cure it; and more people want, "This blue can make the sky blue in the winter and summer, and the sky is blue in the city."
Why do the people of the capital love the sun?
Only because the people who lived in this city in the past suffered from fog, so they were particularly eager to look forward to the blue sky, and the "Blue Sky Defense War" was ringing in Beijing, and after the continued improvement of air quality, the fog became smaller, the blue sky grew, and the happiness gained was particularly important in their eyes.
Beijing was clear on the day of the Fourth of July.
At 8 a.m., 35 air quality monitoring sites across the city were mostly shown as "first-level" green.
The social platform is still going on by the people's spontaneous Blue Sky.
Why is the sky so blue in Beijing recently?
According to the head of the Beijing City Environmental Protection Agency, in August this year, the average concentration of fine particles (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 ug/m3, which has been the best record of the same period in the last five years.
PM2.5 real-time concentrations in September are even more current digits.
A major factor in the emergence of the Blue Sky is the overall benefit of weather conditions in recent periods, and more importantly, the constant management of atmospheric pollution in Beijing, which has been promoting clean air action plans for the last five years, with environmental benefits being released, reducing total emissions in the region, which have laid the foundation for continuous improvement in air quality.
Beijing officially launched and implemented the Beijing Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017 in 2013.
According to the plan, official ongoing guidance to non-capital functional disintegrate, promoting energy purification alternatives and pollution reduction efforts, with a total of 4923 coal-fired boilers.
Beijing became the first big city in China to achieve a gas-wide gasization in the interior of China.
Data show that between 2013 and 2017, the cumulative annual decline in PM2.5 in Beijing was 35.6 per cent; air quality reached the target days increased by 50 days; the number of days of first-class advantage increased by 25 days; a total of 35 days of heavy pollution and a significant decrease in the incidence of heavy pollution.
While air quality continues to improve, Beijing officially, based on a new round of PM2.5 sources, launched the Beijing City Plan of Action for Winning Blue Sky Defence in September this year, focusing on priority areas such as diesel trucks, dust, volatile organic matter governance, optimize adjustment of transport structures, industrial structures, energy structures and land-use structures, strengthening regional coalition control, working to strengthen urban precision management, fully promote green development, and try to keep the Blue Sky in the capital, and no longer "the rare value of the object " , to return to the background of people's albums rather than the main character.
During the Golden Week of the National Day this year, relevant departments such as the Municipal Tourism Council, business, city administration, public security, will strengthen law enforcement checks on the "one-day tour" market, focusing on the "six blacks" of tourism, and the violators will be punished by the law, and they will be punished by the law.
Yesterday morning, the city held a major illegal "one-day tour" meeting to deploy a special operation to further fight illegal "one day trip".
It was revealed that the black ticket, the black guide, the black club, the black car, the black shop, the black net profit chain, the "six blacks" that the city has been playing illegal "one-day tour" since July 28th.
To date, the city has received 39 complaints from a day trip, a 63% decrease in the same period; 270 complaints have been received throughout the city since this year, a 62% decrease in the same period.
For nearly two months, the city has seized 248 black cars, 158 travel passenger traffic violations, closed 29 shopping "black shops" and performing places, 13 Black Clubs, 27 black guides, 26,000 illegal advertisements, 31 illegal "one day-swam" billboards, 3 pieces of public transport station plates, 1789 cases of all types of travel offences, 181 cases of functional services, from a heavy fine of $448 million and the detention of 111 persons involved in the brigade.
After healing, the illegal "one-day tour" is largely contained, and the "one-day tour" market order is stable and good.
It was described that the city has been increasing its efforts to treat illegal "one-day trips" in recent years.
In 2016 and 2017, the City Tourism Commission received 1612 and 897 complaints, a 79% and 44% reduction in the same period, but illegal "one day trip" still goes on, and often rebounds and creates black tickets, black guides, black cars, black cars, black shops, black shops, black nets, etc., and the "six black" images of interest chains such as black tickets.
Specifically, street illegal passengers are "black tickets " , the illegal website that publishes false travel information, the "black net " , the illegal "day tour" travel agency or the person who does not have the qualifications of travel agencies or individuals who do not have the qualifications of travel agencies or individuals who do not have the qualifications of travel, the "black car " , which eventually brings tourists into the designated tourist shopping shop, the designated tourist shopping shop, the designated tourist shopping shop, which eventually takes tourists into the designated tourist shopping shop, the "black shop".
In this special operation, the city continued to increase the fixed inspection and motor patrol of illegal "one-day trips" and, in response to the high frequency and impact of the illegal "one-day trip" tourist route points, and the authorities sent daily secret visits to the car to follow up the car and find evidence of violations.
Among them, Black Car and Black Shop became the focus of two of the special operations.
It was described that illegal "one-day tour" without a black car, which was easy to find, remember and search, and a fixed asset of higher value.
The relevant departments use road traffic surveillance probes to increase the regulation of the "one-day tour" tour bus, and the technical intelligence tools such as technical protection, physical protection, etc. can detect the location of the Black Car in a timely manner.
Travel shopping "black shop" is also a major focus because of the small number, sitting down.
In order to strengthen the deterrent and resistance to illegal "one-day trips", any of the specific operations that have been identified and violated, the functional departments are punished by the law.
In August this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to illegal "one-day tour" to examine measures that combine administrative penalties and criminalization.
The Municipal Tourism Commission has indicated that more regular travel agencies will encourage more regular travel agencies to carry out Beijing "one-day trips" to increase the supply of regular "one-day trips" to further squeeze the space of illegal "one-day travel" and that specific programmes are still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission has continuously improved the electronic travel unit information system to ensure that each team is regulated by the electronic travel sheet platform.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economy symbol, what has been going on in U-town these years?
As a permanent venue for the World Internet Congress, U-town has received the summit dividend and is of great concern.
Since the first World Internet Congress, the changes in U-town have been visible for five years.
In 2014, there were only 12 businesses in the town with the digital economy, and by the third quarter of this year, there were over 500.
This is a microcosm of the development of the digital economy in U-town.
The Internet conference was held to allow local firms to accept the digital economy, the inspiration of the digital wave, and the desire for enterprise transformation is strong, and traditional manufacturing firms have increased their input and development in terms of machine change, intelligent management, etc.
Kang Zheng, Secretary of the U-town Party, said that U-town would build a new economic empowerment centre in the future.
The development of the digital economy cannot be supported by infrastructure.
This year, U-town launched a 5G pilot based on the 4G communications network and free WiFi coverage.
Meanwhile, the city of Kiryu, where U-town is located, as the first county city in the country to build international Internet data-specific access, has become a hot ground for Internet industry development.
Since the first World Internet Congress, Kiryu has introduced 565 digital economic projects, with a total investment of $377.25 billion, with a total increase of 13 per cent over the first three quarters of the year.
"U-town was a tourist symbol, and then there were drama and cultural symbols... because the Internet conference, it is now the Internet and digital economy symbol. "
The Secretary of the Kiryu City Council, a strong army, believes that the dividends of the World Internet Congress have accumulated over time and therefore require a platform to accommodate the super-import of elements of talent, projects, technology, etc.
Shen Yi worked outside for 20 years, and he went home to start a business because of the Internet Congress.
On December 2, last year, he walked into the fourth Internet Light Fair with high-capacity anti-manufacturing digital technology solutions, which was favoured by multiple clients.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in U-town not only because of home-based relationships, " In U-town, it's easier to get people than I thought, and our applications are fast, and we have our applications in the U-town Smart Parking Project. "
A U-town street, which shows the spill effect of the Internet conference.
This road that runs north and south of Kiryu is not only a tourist attraction, but also an industrial street.
It was created for Ito, U-town Avenue.
Journalists understand that in the future, U-town Avenue will be the main position for industrial development in Kiryu Village, leading the use of intelligent medicine, intelligent old age, intelligent government, etc., to gather 80 per cent of the industry and a wide range of high-level talent in the market.
The earthquake in Indonesia caused a tsunami that killed at least 410 people.
According to the Director of Public Information Bureau of the Public Information Department of the Jakarta Police of Indonesia, the earthquake in Central Sulawesi has now killed 410 people, 97 of whom have been identified.
Another 29 disappeared and 540 injured.
Palu Airport is still closed.
Active treatment, China has a survival rate of 98% of premature births in 29 weeks and above, reaching developed countries.
The National Centre for Children ' s Medicine, 30 September, Shanghai, revealed that it introduced Canada's advanced methods in the leading China NCIU pre-natal quality improvement project.
The results of the project show that, after active treatment, 98% of premature births in China and above, have reached developed countries, but there is still room for significant improvement in survival of premature births and premature births.
For almost 20 years, the Chinese government has been concerned about the treatment of newborns.
Currently, infant mortality in Shanghai has fallen to 3.71 per 1,000, significantly below the national average, reaching advanced levels in developed countries.
The China NICU pre-natal quality improvement project has significantly improved the quality of premature births through four years of hard work.
Professor Cao Yun, Director of the Neonatal Care Unit (NICU), attached to the University of Jordan, stated to journalists that while increasing the survival rate of premature births, attention was paid to reducing the quality of premature births, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the overall outcome of neurodevelopment, and was important for improving the overall quality of survival of premature children and population, and was important for improving the overall quality of survival of premature children and the quality of the population, as important for improving the overall quality of early births and the quality of the population, and was also a key concern to the project.
The China NCU pre-natal quality improvement project, which has been working hard for four years to include tens of thousands of premature births in the country and below, has reduced the mortality rate of premature births in the country by 1/3, while the incidence of severe complications of premature births has significantly increased the quality of survival of premature births.
The project has introduced collaborative quality improvement concepts through the establishment of a national network for improvement of newborn quality, 25 collaborative hospitals across China, and a collaborative approach to improving the level of neonatal treatment, systems and effective collaborative quality improvement methods.
The Paediatric Hospital, affiliated with the University of Jordan, is joining the National Newborn Science Force to develop guidelines for neonatal infections based on project experience, providing reference and guidance for regular treatment for newborn infections in China.
It is understood that in the China Early Childhood Quality Improvement Project, Paediatric Hospital introduced the EPIQ methodology into 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces of the country, working to address premature childhood infections that have plagued the Chinese neonatal care unit.
After more than 10 years, Canada has increased its survival rate of premature births by about one third, and Canada is now one of the best countries in the world after premature births.
The EPIQ methodology has now been applied to all NICUs throughout Canada and has been adopted by six countries.
According to paediatric hospitals, the results of the study show that two years after the EPIQ intervention, premature child infections fell by 35%, while antibiotics were reduced by 20%.
In the future, the University of Jordan Paediatric Hospital will continue to promote and implement this approach nationwide, focusing on a comprehensive reduction in all complications of premature births and improving the quality of treatment of newborns throughout the country.
Now, there is a fact that there are differences and inequality in all regions of China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important building unit for the National Centre for Children ' s Medicine, Paediatric Hospital will play a leading radiation role, covering several western provinces such as Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting homogeneity and regulation of neonatal treatment throughout the country.
It is understood that paediatric hospitals associated with the University of Jordan are joining the national neonatal forces to develop guidelines for the treatment of newborn infections based on the project to develop guidelines for the treatment of newborn infections in China.
It was revealed that in 2019, the Coordinating Centre ' s Network of Newborns, located at the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Jordan, will unite 63 hospitals throughout the country to improve the next phase of national quality improvements with a view to promoting the average development of the level of treatment of newborns in China.
The Director of the Shanghai Health Planning Commission has been surprised to say that Shanghai could become the central city of the Asian centre, not only in research, but also the construction of the entire service system, and that quality of services and service results should have a place in Asia, thereby truly reflecting China's level of health care.
Singping: Building the "hero monument" in your heart -- written on the fifth day of the martyrs.
On September 30, on the eve of the 69th birthday of the Republic, we welcomed the fifth martyr anniversary, and Xi's leader came to Tiananmen Square to attend the basket of flowers to the hero of the people.
At this moment, wherever you are, pay tribute to Young-young.
The anniversary is a re-enactment, and it's a wake-up call.
Turning the thick history behind every martyr's name is a living life.
They, too, have hot youth, true love, family.
Yet, because they believe that "theism of our faith is the truth of the universe," and in order to save the suffering of the next generation, they will sacrifice everything.
"I'll be crying for China for a day of survival."
Through time and space, the British set up a spiritual sign, leading the way forward.
"Where to go, where to " be a man " , read English, and it's not hard to get answers.
The most important thing is to build a hero monument in your heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary war, about 20 million martyrs have died bravely for national independence, people liberated, and the country has been brave and brave.
For various reasons, many of the first ones didn't even leave a name.
Thousands of British men pour their ideals with blood, practice faith with life, remember their name and pass on their spirit, to protect the roots and souls of the nation.
This "hero monument" cannot be defiled or destroyed.
For some time, history has been in a state of insinuating, and so on.
A distortion of history, derogatory practices, challenges the conscience of justice, miscalculation of value, causing public anger and alarm throughout society.
The hero cannot forget.
The act that touches the bottom line must not be heard, and the sword must be made to defend the dignity of the rule of law.
On May 1, this year, the Heroes Martyrs Protection Act was officially implemented.
In judicial practice, the judgment of some cases is a very fast-tracked, effective preservation of the image of the British and brightness in accordance with the law, and has released the hero and admires the positive energy of the first.
A people with pursuits cannot be without heroes, a country with ideals cannot be without pioneers.
Remembering the first and calling for heroes has become a universal social consensus.
Currently, there are millions of memorial facilities in the country, and more than 100 million visits to the Martyrs' Hills are visited each year.
The heart is the strongest cornerstone.
Let the hero, defend the hero, learn hero, love hero, and integrate the spirit of the nation into the blood of the nation, a "hero monument" will stand between the heavens and the earth, deep in the hearts of hearts.

After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in almost two weeks on Friday, while Italian bond returns reached its highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged by the October deadline, the European Commission may reject the draft budget of Italy, which the Executive Committee has never done to any country.
At a meeting in Riga, the Vice-President of the European Commission, East Brosky later stated on Friday that Italy ' s current financial plan " seemed inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Convention " , which referred to the EU financial provisions.
But he didn't say how it would trigger the EU to react.

The national filmless cotton field viewing and seminar exchange experts walked into the test field and heard a presentation by representatives of the Chinese Engineering Academy's team.
On September 30th, the Chinese New Net, Xinjiang, was located at the membrane cotton planting test base in Xinjiang Shaya County, with a "no bad color" compared to the next membrane cotton, and a white cotton competition was "opened" with branches.
From 27 to 28 September, the national filmless cotton live viewing and seminar exchange was held in Xinjiang Shaya County.
At the Moot, journalists learned that the membrane-free cotton technology system, which focused on the "Chinese cotton 619" and its associated cultivation measures, had initially achieved the goal of membrane-free cultivation in cotton fields, reducing significant progress in the pollution of the ecological environment and the original cotton membrane in Xinjiang.
Member of the Chinese Engineering College, a famous cotton genetic breeder, leading scientist in the national modern agricultural industry technology system, claims that the Trees and Forestry School Party Secretary Zhou Guo Moo presented the growth of the membrane cotton.
" The integrated membrane cotton technology we have developed can fully achieve cotton cultivation without membrane, which can address the problem of membrane pollution and achieve green cotton planting ... "
The Chinese Engineering Academy is a quick introduction to the tree.
Xinjiang is China's most important cotton-producing area, and according to the National Statistical Office, Xinjiang cotton cultivation in 2017 was 35 million acres, or 61% of the country's cotton area.
Since the introduction of the membrane in 1982, the area of various crops in Xinjiang has been over 50 million acres and is used by about 300,000 tons per year.
Of these, cotton membrane cover is 100%, and cotton membrane accounts for about 60% of the use of the Xinjiang membrane.
Membrane cotton is measured, and cotton production is fully capable of achieving 320 to 350 kg of acre.
As Xinjiang membrane inputs increase, the rate of recycling of residual membrane is low, the amount of diaphragms in soil increases, and a series of problems such as soil structure damage, which seriously affect the sustainable development of agriculture.
The diaphragms not only cause severe pollution of soil, but also have a significant impact on cotton fibre quality.
Currently, more than one third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have been mechanized.
In 2017, Xinjiang had about 14 million acres of cotton.
The mass of the cotton harvest process, the shredded film on the cotton plant, which was mixed with the original cotton process was difficult to remove during the original cotton processing process, nor could it be completely removed during subsequent textile processing, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.
On September 28th, the national filmless cotton field viewing and seminar exchange was held in Xinjiang Shaya County.
To focus on addressing cotton membrane pollution, simplify cotton planting technology and improve cotton field efficiency, it is clear that the tree has led his team through eight years to implement the "Sino Cotton 619" membrane-free cotton technology to add wings to the green development of Xinjiang agriculture.
The tree is a quick introduction to the new idea of creating early, salt-resistant, low temperature-resistant, rich, fresh-born cotton 619.
" The Central Cotton 619' has achieved a series of measures such as membrane sowing machines under the conditions of membrane cultivation in the southern Xinjiang region, sowing depth improvements, drip belts under non-film conditions, suitable for sowing density screening, reasonable chemical regulation ... "
Currently, Aksu, Kurle, Aral, etc. have established a demonstration base for membrane cotton, producing 4,800 kg per ha.
Cotton is grown without membrane, and has achieved a rich production, a section, environmental protection, and a combination of benefits.
Zhang Donghai, the third division of the Xinjiang Production Corps, an agrologist, said that, through research and demonstration of membrane cotton cultivation in the last six years, the production of membrane seed cotton can fully achieve 320 to 350 kg of acre, possibly even higher.
" There are great prospects for the promotion of membrane cotton cultivation technologies ... "
Zhang Dinghai believes that the current membrane cultivation technology can address soil debris pollution, but there is a certain gap in economic benefits than membrane cultivation.
" The support of cotton acquisition prices will facilitate future promotion ... "
The next step is that he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and large-scale extension applications of membrane cotton, making the membrane industry a major solution to soil pollution caused by the membrane.

Mrs. Song, who was so fast, told the press that the Fourth of July was a long holiday of a year, and came to Hong Kong's Golden Purple Square to see the flag raising her always wish, and that it would be so happy and excited to make that wish on the Fourth of July.
But now Ningxia's flight to Hong Kong is in a difficult position, so that Mr. Song found out after searching for the train schedule, and the first bus will be available at 7:3 a.m., and access to the city's transport to Golden Purple Square.
He was impressed with the press: " The high iron is too convenient and fast and on time!"
The 70-hour short-distance train from South Guangzhou, Shenzhen North and Fukuda and West Kowloon, greatly facilitated the arrival of residents in the Bay of Australia.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, is preparing to go to Hong Kong friends who meet the mountain at the top of the Central Ring Mountain.
Mr. Liu said: " The interior of the Fourth of July and Hong Kong are on vacation, and we are going to challenge ourselves to see if we can finish the 50 km port route! "
He explained that if it wasn't for high iron, easy to travel and time, they wouldn't have tried the mountains so long.
Mrs. Yang from Dong-hoon came to Hong Kong with her 10-year-old son to Hong Kong with a high iron, and she proudly told the reporters that it had been studying the piano for three years, and it was meaningful to spend the Fourth of July in this way.
She was on the bus before, but it took time, and she was worried about affecting her son's state, and this time she came by Shenzhen to take high iron, to get through the high iron, to halve time, and she was impressed by the Hong Kong sector, and she said to the press, " It's like taking a subway, especially fast, and I didn't get to take a picture! "
On September 23rd, at 6:44, the G5711 High-Range train left Shenzhen North Station, and the train entered the Hong Kong section of the Hong Kong High Steel section in a few minutes, the first officially operated high train in Hong Kong.
The country's 25,000 km high iron network, which is located directly to 38 long-distance stations in Hong Kong, is also a tourist from the interior in different provinces of the north and south.
While Mr. Gao, who visited his family from Changsha, told the press that the high iron had only been taken north of Shenzhen before taking the subway to Hong Kong and then re-transmit the city by the subway, in exchange for trouble and at a cost, and now it was very happy to sit directly to the Kowloon Center and have lunch at home.
He said that the "one-two-check" clearance process was more convenient than I thought, "In less than 10 minutes, both of them passed."
The West Kowloon station, which connects land and air traffic, is also the preferred place for many transit passengers.
Miss Wu from Fujian is going to travel to the Philippines from Hong Kong to the Philippines, and she pushed her luggage out of the gate at West Kowloon and said to the press, " I was afraid not to catch up with the plane, and I didn't think so soon, more than enough time! "
According to the trade agreement subsidiary arrangements published on Monday, the new US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain US President Trump's ability to impose a 25 per cent tariff threat on imported cars, while making vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico largely exempts customs duties.
If Trump impose so-called "Chapter 232" tariffs on cars for national security reasons, Mexico and Canada will have a vehicle quota that exports 2.6 million taxes to the United States each year.
In accordance with the subsidiary arrangements, the Pica produced in both countries will be fully exempt from customs duties.
If Trump impose a car tariff, Mexico will receive a $108 billion exemption for car parts per year, and Canada will receive $32.4 billion in quota.
Both quotas are much higher than the existing production levels of both countries, providing room for growth in exports between the two countries.
Reuters Washington/Mexico 28 September - Mexico stated on Friday that after several days of debate, the Government of United States President Trump and Canada were making practical efforts to resolve trade policy differences and that the outside world would expect the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to maintain the form of a three-party agreement.
Although there is no detail, the obvious progress described above is sufficient to drive Mexico and the United States Government to suddenly stop publishing the two trade agreement texts and give Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in Mexico stated to journalists that the United States Government had made new counter-recommendations to the Canadian Government and stated that he would continue to promote the participation of all three countries in NAFTA.
According to the Minister of Economy of Mexico, Ildefonso Guajardo, the time for submitting the text of the trade agreement between the United States and the United States to Mexico and United States legislation was delayed because Canada and the United States Government had tried to reach an agreement "very seriously".
Guahardo states that " within the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a trilateral agreement text or have to publish the text of the agreement ... "
Guahardo said his American and Canadian equivalents "specially requested" to postpone the release of the text.
The spokesman for the United States Trade Representative Office (USTR) did not comment on the text of the trade agreement between the United States and Canada.
Officials of the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Office of Foreign Affairs did not respond to requests for comments on counter-recommendations.
According to foreign media reports, it's hard to see anything unusual in a care centre on the outskirts of Pretoria, South Africa, two lions playing together, and it's hard to see anything unusual, but they're not the only ones.
The University of Pretoria announced: " This is the first lion ever to be born in artificial insemination - the first pair in the world. "
The school scientists are working on the reproductive system of the mother and African lion.
Ganswint, Director of the Institute of Mammals, University of Pretoria, said that the two young lions born on August 25 were quite healthy and normal.
His team finally made this breakthrough after 18 months of intensive testing.
Ganswint, who was interviewed by the media, said: " We collect sperm from a healthy lion ... "
Next, when researchers and others have hormone levels in the lion, they are manual insemination.
Ganswint said: " Fortunately, the result was successful ... "
He said that researchers "to try several times, but unexpectedly, they didn't spend much effort."
He said that the breakthroughs in the previous study could be repeated and that scientists wanted to use this technology to save large cats that are endangered.
According to the International Union for Nature Conservation, lions have been extinct in 26 countries in Africa, and the total number of wild lions survived has been reduced by 43% over the past 20 years, with only about 20,000 left.
African lions are classified as vulnerable animals by this organization.
Ganswint said, " If we don't do something for this animal, they'll face extinction."
He said that this new technology did not have to be raised by lions, but rather to inject sperm into pregnant female lions, just like North America and Europe did to raise elephants.
Korea ' s exports declined to the largest in September in more than two years, but analysts blame the decline for fewer working days and stated that global demand for Korean commodities remains strong despite the rise in trade tensions between China and the United States.
Indeed, Korea's average exports increased last month.
In addition, earlier data on initial values show double-digit growth in exports in the first few weeks before the long holidays.
Korea ' s export decline in September was the largest since July 2016, with a decrease of 5.7% than the estimated decline of 11 analysts from the Reuters Survey.
The initial value released on Monday shows that exports in September amounted to $5.6 billion, down from $5.2 billion in August.
Although the growing US-China trade dispute could cause other export-dependent Chinese neighbours, Korea ' s exports to China grew by 7.8 per cent in September, expanding for the 23rd consecutive month.
Korea's exports to the United States fell by 11.8%, due to the decline in the sale of petroleum products.
Korean memory chips and oil products have increased overseas sales by 28.3 per cent and 13.5%, although the market's concern about the so-called chip "supercycle" may have been at the top.
" However, the impact of trade conflicts will be inevitable, as South Korean exports depend heavily on the United States and Chinese markets ... "
Imports declined by 2.1 per cent to $40.8 billion, not as expected by the Reuters Survey by 3.1 per cent.
The initial trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
According to the Ministry of Industry, the global manufacturing industry will remain smooth by the United States and EU countries, which is a favourable factor for Korean exports.
The statement states that " the increase in export prices resulting from the rise in oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of this year ... "
"But the trade conflict between the United States and China continues, and market volatility has increased after the United States interest rate rises, are negative pressures facing exports ... "
Exports per working day in September increased to $2.6 billion, compared to $2.1 billion in August.
Korea fell on September 24-26 this year, so there were only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same period last year.
Korea exports grew by 4.7% over the same period last year.
According to the daily/markit procurement manager index, Korean manufacturing activities rose back in September but supported by domestic orders, which fear that the other export prospects would be covered by a fall in orders from China and Japan.
The Korean media criticized the United States for not relaxing sanctions against the DPRK.
North Korea Labour News published a comment article on September 30, criticizing the United States of America for not relaxed sanctions against the DPRK while seeking dialogue with the DPRK, calling it a "controversial" approach.
According to the article, United States Secretary of State Pompeyo "on 4th day, the key to the implementation of sanctions against the DPRK " , stressed that the position of the United States to continue to implement United Nations sanctions resolutions remains unchanged.
In the joint statement of the United States of Singapore, the two sides committed themselves to building a new relationship between the United States and the United States that are adapted to the desire of the peoples of the DPRK and the United States for peace and prosperity.
The US has increased the pressure on sanctions and demands dialogue, which is undoubtedly contradictory.
The article states that if a new Korean-American relationship is to build a permanent consolidated peace system on the Korean peninsula and achieve a completely non-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula, trust should be put first, starting with what can be done and resolved in a phase by phase.
The article also states that the United States should understand that sanctions are not working on North Korea.
The article says that even the North Devonsk before Kazan is a compliment.
The National Interest magazine quotes the U.S. Navy's point of view: "We'll meet a strong potential opponent... and just look at the North Devonsk submarine."
The current commander-in-chief of the European Navy, Fogo, also praised the North Devonsk submarine.
He said: " This submarine is impressive... and looking at the development of the Russian Navy, the use of resources will know that its main efforts in research and development are first and foremost to strengthen the submarine fleet ... "

Ignore the American threat!
The EU may enter into a crude oil procurement agreement with Iran
The U.S. government has recently declared that a new round of sanctions against Iran will be restarted in November and even urges other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
But the American allies don't seem to hear it.
According to the United States New York Times, on 29th, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed that, despite the threat of sanctions against any country that does business with Iran, Tehran is approaching an agreement with the EU on crude oil sales.
The core purpose of this agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, which replaces United States dollar transactions by easy-to-good or real currency.
The purpose of this method is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from blocking financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is committed to the contribution of the agreement, some French and British officials are concerned that if the agreement is achieved, it will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States, which opposes the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran Nuclear Agreement.
The media say that in an hour of interviews, Zarif sounds more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the agreement has the ability to "smuggle" the traditional allies of the United States and effectively break the American behavior of trying to cut Iran's income.
" This ensures that we sell oil and benefit " , Zarif believes that under the agreement reached in 2015, States have legitimate rights to trade with Iran ...
Federika Mogarini, the head of EU foreign policy, also stated earlier that " no sovereign State or organization can accept the decision of anyone else to trade with ... "
However, she also predicted that before the next sanctions imposed by the United States Government in November, American leaders might have taken a range of financial means to target banks, businessmen and countries that have business with Tehran.
In May this year, the United States Government announced its unilateral withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear Agreement on the grounds of defects and stated that it could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The US then threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other goods from operating in the United States.
This threat caused some companies to evacuate Tehran, and the Iranian currency fell.
Airbus and French oil giant Dodal have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said that the U.S. government might "take the top."
Unfortunately, according to a recent Turkish media report, United States sanctions do not seem to have had a significant impact on Iranian oil exports.
Iranian oil minister Zangane recently revealed that no other country except Korea had stopped buying Iranian oil.
Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani believe that a series of acts in the United States was intended to "inducing" Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif also ignored a series of oral attacks by the United States, and when asked if the United States would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed, " It was a strategy of regime change, which is the real purpose of the United States ... "

Reuters Nagoya, November 5th - On Monday, President of the Central Bank of Japan, Toshiya, stated on Monday that the central bank was aware that the long-standing implementation of super-easing monetary policies could squeeze the profit margin of financial institutions and could undermine the stability of the banking system in the country.
But he said that, given the low inflation and uncertainty of overseas economies, the Central Bank of Japan needed to maintain its large-scale stimulus plan while following closely the advantages and disadvantages of its policies.
" The Central Bank of Japan fully recognizes that under sustained monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected, as stated in his speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He claims that if financial institutions are more active in taking risks to compensate for the narrow impact of low interest rates over the years, the banking system could be volatile once a serious negative impact occurs.
" While these risks are not significant at this time, the central bank will pay close attention to developments and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures, he claims ...
The records of the Central Bank of Japan earlier Monday show that at the September meeting, the Central Bank Policy Committee of Japan discussed the rising costs of long-term easing policies.
The minutes of the meeting show that if the economy continues to expand, " the central bank of Japan has more space for policy flexibility in the future ... "
The minutes of the meeting show that another member stated that, given its limitations during the duration of the policy, the Commission should discuss how long the Japanese Central Bank could maintain the stimulus policy.
According to Hida Dong-hyun, the Central Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks posed by easing policies, while considering uncertainty surrounding the economic prospects of Japan, which may affect global demand as a result of trade friction and growing protectionism in China and the United States.
" The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is temporarily limited, as Heda Dong-hyun claims ...
" But how the problem continues, the impact on the Japanese economy may grow, " he added.
" There is a need to continue a strong monetary easing policy, while considering positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner, " Toshiko Kurada said ...
Despite the increase in the disadvantages of radical stimulus schemes, such as the long-term low interest rate erosion of financial institutions, inflation has forced the Central Bank of Japan to maintain it.
The Central Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the global trade war, Hida Dong-hyun ruled out the possibility of recent interest increases.

The tweet says he's considering privatization and financing Tesla at $420 per share.
SEC claims that these tweets are not actually justified and that the market turmoil caused by it has damaged investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say that the agreement could enhance Tesla, which has been severely damaged by Mask's recent behavior.
Steven Heim, head of Boston Common asset management, said that the settlement agreement should give Musk more supervision, without taking the "destructive" measure to drive him out of Tesla.
The asset management company holds Panasonic stock, Tesla's battery manufacturer.
Under this proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop control of external communication against Musk.
"The matter was quickly resolved in accordance with the agreed conditions in which our markets and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, " SEC President Clayton said in a statement ...
Thursday's allegations led to the evaporation of about $7 billion in Tesla's market value, which was $45.2 billion on Friday, lower than $47.5 billion in General Motors.
The SEC took back the request to drive Mask off the company's master in the settlement agreement.
Many investors say this punishment will be catastrophic.
"I think it's the best possible result for all the people concerned, " Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners said that Feinseth gave Tesla neutral" rating and that the SEC penalty was "lightly punished" for Mask.
"He's still CEO important for Tesla."
Neither Musk nor Tesla recognized or denied the SEC charges in the settlement agreement nor immediately responded to the request for comment.
The settlement agreement still requires court approval.

General Secretary Xi made a very important speech at the private enterprise symposium to inject firm confidence into the private economy towards a wider stage.
General Secretary Xi stressed that "Let entrepreneurs take off their minds and move on light" have triggered a strong resonance among a wide range of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market dynamics come from people, especially entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the 40 years of reform and opening up, there are stories of millions of entrepreneurs who have built up their entrepreneurial innovation, and the growth of the business community continues to drive the tide of the Chinese economy.
For some time, people in society have made some negative statements about the private economy.
Misstatements like the so-called "private economy exit theory" have caused doubts and concerns to some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private enterprises have experienced difficulties and problems in business development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some export enterprises; rapid adjustment of demand structures has put pressure on transformational upgrading; some policies are not coordinated, policy effects are overlapping, or simple working methods, leading to the opposite role of some of the original intentions of good policies, etc.
There are factors that interact, the private economy is in trouble, and some private enterprises are in trouble, and entrepreneurs show a lot of anxiety.
Against this background, correcting the wrong areas of awareness, removing the burden of entrepreneurs, allowing businesses to develop, and governments are committed to development, and about market confidence and development expectations, and have particularly profound relevance.
The symposium once again highlighted the important argument of "three unchanged": "The position and role of the non-public economy in our economic and social development has not changed!"
From advancing the decentralization, the establishment of a list of powers to create a rule of law environment that protects the legitimate interests of entrepreneurs, to create a fair competitive market environment and shape a climate of respect for entrepreneurs as a whole, and in recent years the party central attention to entrepreneurs, institutional security has been unprecedented.
The symposium clearly proposed policy initiatives in support of private enterprise development in six areas, and launched a series of practical actions dedicated to private enterprise "light-dressing forward".
This is a great inspiration for entrepreneurs and more expectations for all sectors of society.
The fog is out, the approach is set, and the key is to implement.
To continuously create a better environment for private economies, help private enterprises address development difficulties and help to upgrade China ' s economic transformation; to make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legitimate operations, respect in social life, stimulate innovation and create potential.
The Chinese economy is entering a process of high-quality development requires more entrepreneurs to develop their ambitions and provide greater space and stage for entrepreneurs ' creativity.
We have reason to believe that with further deepening reforms and breaking barriers, the private economy will face better development prospects and development opportunities and move towards a broader stage.

Han Zheng chicken soup exports to China have increased 20 times in four years or related to the increase in the number of young people in the empty nest - the new network.
Han Zheng chicken soup has increased 20 times over four years.
Korean Union reported that last year Korean chicken soup exports to China exceeded $100,000, about 20 times more than in 2013.
According to the analysis, this increase is related to the increase in the number of young people in Chinese air nests that drive easy food hot sales and young people's attention to the increase in nutrition.
The data was published by the Korean Agricultural Food Circulation Community (aT) on 5th day.
Last year, Korean chicken soup exports to China amounted to $10.33.9 million, weighing $218.59 million kg, an increase of 2094 per cent and 3668.8 per cent, respectively, compared to 2013.

AT states that there was avian flu outbreak in Korea from November 2016 to April last year, and the authorities had completely banned chicken soup exports to China, resulting in a sharp decline in exports.
The export of chicken soup to China in 2016 amounted to $840,000, and exports dropped to $100,000 last year due to avian flu.

The national flag-raising ceremony was celebrated at the port of the Central Cross border.
" I can't believe there is such a spectacular flag-raising ceremony on the border, which is more shocking than watching the flag in the interior. "
On the morning of 1st, Mr. Zhang, who visited the border between Sichuan, and more than 500 troops, resident residents and tourists from China and abroad watched the flag-raising ceremony and celebrated the 69th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China.
The port of the river is the largest port in the Yunnan section of the border between China and Viet Nam, located in Haguchi County, Yunnan Province, and is a national port.
As the country's "one way" continues to build, as China is one of the easiest channels to connect South-East Asia, the flow of entry and exit from the port of the river has grown steadily.
At 7:30 a.m., the sun just came out, and the restricted area at the port of the river was gathered early to watch the flag-raising ceremony, local people and middle and foreign tourists.
At 0745 hours, the flag-raising ceremony began on time, and the national gate team at the river mouth border checkpoint was shaking and escorting the flag to the flag up at the foot of the body.
After the commander gave the flag-raising order, the flag raised his hand and pulled out an arc, and the bright five-star red flag spreads the flag like the Eagle Wings, and the melody that was raging with the national anthem was slowly rising.
"The national flag-raising ceremony is held at every New Year's Day, spring festival, etc., not only the image of China, but also inspires the patriotism of the people of the border ... "
The army soldiers who attended this flag-raising ceremony said:
According to the information received, the national gate team responsible for the flag-raising ceremony at the port of the river is composed of more than 40 troops from various positions at the Haguchi border checkpoint, from three to a scale-up team, which has been in existence for over 60 years, and has been carrying out more than 70 military missions at the national level since its inception.

The Chinese Ministry of Finance, the head of the National Tax Administration, stated on 30 days that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step would be considered to continue preferential arrangements for persons abroad, including Hong Kong and Australia.
According to the person responsible, the current regulations on personal income tax regulations provide for tax issues for persons abroad, and that individuals who have no residence but live in China for less than five years, are derived from income outside China and may pay personal income taxes only in part of the payment of individuals within China or individuals.
The part paid outside the country does not require personal income tax in China.
The Ministry of Finance of China, the National Tax Administration, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Commerce has also issued a circular to expand the application of offshore investors to distribute direct investment in profits.

During the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, the parties released some positive information around the Korean peninsula.
President Wen of Korea has translated the Korean "reversible" nuclear determination and stated that President Trump and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un may meet by the end of this year.
The United States Department of State then stated that Secretary of State Pompeyo would visit North Korea in October to promote the implementation of the commitment of the leaders of the United States and the DPRK, Singapore.
From the beginning of this year to the present, the Koreans have broken the road to dialogue, the Korean and Korean leaders meet, the major trends in the mitigation situation on the peninsula have continued, and the principles of dialogue to address the problem of the peninsula have been maintained.
First, the "the essence of the peninsula problem is security" has not changed, and peace on the peninsula is to achieve peace on the peninsula, and the key is to balance the reasonable security concerns of all parties, rather than putting pressure on each other, and emphasizes their claims.
Secondly, in the dialogue on the non-nuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned disagree between the steps and means of denuclearization of the peninsula, and the game thinking of "who first and after" remains strong because of the long lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States.
The two points on the peninsula were again highlighted by the two points on the peninsula, which was held at United Nations Headquarters in New York, with different voices on sanctions against the DPRK.
United States Secretary of State Pompeyo insisted that sanctions on North Korea would not be lifted until the Korean peninsula was completely denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, for his part, stressed the principle of "action in action", said: " The weakened trend of sanctions should be synchronized with the steps taken by North Korea on the gradual abandonment of nuclear roads " .
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement the Council ' s resolutions in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner, but pressure is not an end, and the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of political resolution is a requirement of Security Council resolutions, which cannot be rejected and cannot be chosen only.
As the Chinese Council of State and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the positive developments in relations between the DPRK and the United States, China believes that the Council needs to consider launching counterproductive provisions in due course, thereby encouraging North Korea and the parties concerned to take a greater step towards non-nuclearization.
Recalling the past, every progress in the process of denuclearization of the peninsula and the peace process requires sufficient political courage.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community to advance the political settlement of the peninsula, the parties concerned should show political strength, political decisions, implement commitments, resolve the challenges and continue to move forward and move forward in parallel to the process of non-nuclearization of the peninsula and the establishment of peace mechanisms on the peninsula, and to create permanent peace on the peninsula.

Reuters Tokyo October 1st - The short-view quarterly report published by the Central Bank of Japan on Monday shows that the confidence of large Japanese manufacturers in Japan reached the lowest level of over a year because of the rise in raw materials costs and a range of natural disasters affecting production, which made businesses feel pressure.
The survey has hardly shown that the rising global trade friction has hit the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full trade war has hit the business prospects of enterprises and could threaten corporate capital spending.
Active capital spending is a bright spot in the Japanese economy.
The survey questioned the view of the Central Bank of Japan that robust economic expansion would help drive inflation to a 2 per cent goal, although there are signs that businesses are gradually turning costs to clients.
" In the context of concerns about the global trade war, manufacturing confidence has stalled due to the slowdown in exports and weak production in factories, as South Wuji, Chief Researcher of the General Institute of Agroforestry, stated ...
" Confidence is still high... and I don't think confidence will continue to decline because business profits are improving and prices are rising. "
Short-term surveys show that the September large manufacturing landscape assessment index fell from 21 to positive 19 three months ago, to deterioration in the third consecutive quarter.
The market estimate is positive 22.
The large non-manufacturing weather judgement index fell from 24 to 22 in June, for the first time in eight quarters.
Reuters's investigation is positive 22.
The survey showed that the December large manufacturing and non-manufacturing weather judgement index remained stable.
Investors do not care about the decline in the short-sighted business landscape index, the Japanese stock-to-day index. N225 rises to 27 years high on Monday, helping to improve the prospects for the profit of exports by Japanese enterprises.
Capital spending is robust.
Despite the decline in corporate confidence, the latest short view highlights the robust corporate capital spending plan, thanks to upgrading capacity and increasing investment in robots and automation to address the labour shortage caused by population ageing.
The Central Bank short-term survey shows that large enterprises plan to increase capital spending by 13.4 per cent in the current fiscal year by March 2019.
The previous short survey was 13.6 %.
South Wuji says that the capital spending plan for all enterprises has grown by 8.5 per cent in the fiscal year, near the pace of the Japanese bubble economy.
He stated that " in view of the increase in small enterprises ' profits estimates from now on, capital spending still has room for further growth, but this depends to a large extent on the impact of trade wars on business confidence ... "
The short-term survey shows that the increased capacity of enterprises to transfer costs, with a high output price index of large enterprises, which is an encouraging sign of progress in Japan ' s efforts to combat deflation.
The index of measuring employment in large enterprises has reached negative 23, which is the most critical level since 1992, highlighting the tightness of the job market.
The Japanese economy rebounded in the second season of the Japanese economy since the contraction in January-March this year.
But summer trade frictions have been upgraded and supply chains are disturbed by natural disasters, and the prospects for Japan's economy, which depend on exports.

Reuters Beijing 5 November - China Foreign Trade Center press release on Sunday stated that the wide-ranging meeting showed that China’s foreign trade situation remained complex and that 80.6 per cent of businesses expected exports throughout 2018 to be better than in the previous year or even.
But given the continued rise in the cost of combined elements such as domestic raw materials, labour force, trade frictions in China and the United States have increased external environments, while participating enterprises believe that next year ' s export situation is not encouraging.
At the closing press conference at the 124th Guangcheng Conference, the Under-Secretary-General of the General Assembly, the press spokesman, Xu Jun, Deputy Director of the China Foreign Trade Centre, stated that the number of buyers abroad at the session had fallen slightly over the same period.
The current procurement was attended by 189,812, from 215 countries and territories, a decrease of 1.11 per cent over the same period.
Exports were made by RMB 2,06494 million (equivalent to $2.98.6 billion), a 1% decrease over the same period.
From the market, for Japan, ASEAN 10, " BRICS " , Korea’s deal grew by 74.4 per cent, 11.4 per cent, 7.2 per cent, 2.5%, and a decrease of 30.3 per cent, 8.9%, 7.3%, 0.8%, respectively.
In industry, transport tools, mechanical equipment, construction and decoration materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, bathing equipment grew by 24.8 per cent, 21.1 per cent, 20.0 per cent, 15.1 per cent, and 7.6 per cent, textile clothing, household appliances by 13.0 per cent, 6.7 per cent, respectively.
Xu Jun said that, as a barometer and windmark for China's foreign trade, the current wide-ranging procurement and export transaction data show that next year China’s foreign trade development still faces many uncertain instability factors.
But as the supply side structural reforms advance, as well as policy measures such as the recent introduction of "six-stable" policy measures have been introduced in countries and local areas, the new dynamics of China ' s foreign trade development are accelerating and new progress in business market diversification, which are important foundations and powerful conditions for foreign trade development.
"Integration factors, it is expected that China ' s foreign trade imports and exports will continue to grow steadily throughout the year, with more quality and efficiency ... "
The General Customs Administration of China announced an increase of 14.5 per cent in September exports in September, an increase of 14.3 per cent over the same period, a trade surplus of $31669 billion in September, the highest rate of growth and trade surplus since February of this year.
Despite the escalation of trade friction between China and the United States, China ' s exports in September are still much more than expected, and companies are in a state of devaluation of the exchange rate before tariff increases in the United States, or a major support factor, but China’s trade war has hit confidence, and the impact on the industrial chain cannot be reduced, and analysts believe that the challenge of China ' s foreign trade may appear in four quarters or next year.
The Reuters survey showed that the United States fund manager proposed an increase in cash holdings in September and continued to remain cautiously, as the United States and China began the latest round of import duties and that there was no sign of mitigation in the dispute.
However, 12 fund managers involved in the survey suggested that North America ' s asset allocation had increased to the highest since June 2017, while the United Kingdom, the eurozone, particularly emerging markets, had declined.
Global equity allocation averaged 56.6%, bonds 35.5%, largely consistent with last month's survey.
The most obvious change is that the cash ratio has risen to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
The fund manager of a large fund company stated that " some economic data have brought confidence to the market, but trade wars remain the greatest concern, so it is best to be prepared to enter when the market falls ... "
But the fund manager still preferred stocks in September, especially in the United States, even if US stock was considered to be at a high price.
Today, China's opening landmark Shanghai, the world's first major national exhibition on the theme of imports - the China International Import Fair, officially opened in the world.
A show is like a window that makes the world better aware of a city and a country.
Through the "window" of the Expo, people see a higher level of "open China"; by entering the Expo, welcome the world and China's mutual benefit from "reform and opening up".
" For a country, openness is like a cocoon butterfly, and it will experience a moment of pain, but will be replaced by a new life ... "
General Xi's summary of the Open Path shows an important reason why China can do it.
Looking back at the 40 years of reform and opening up, China, who dares to enter the world market, despite the vortex and the wind, has been facing all risk challenges, constantly releasing internal dynamics and increasing competitiveness.
China can say that China has made its own real achievements and a strong interpretation of the value and meaning of openness.
At the beginning of a new history, a major decision made by Comrade Xi is a major decision taken by Comrade Xi to advance a new round of high-level public openness, a major initiative of China to open up markets to the world, a practical action in support of economic globalization and trade liberalization, showing the strong and clear will of China to open up markets to the world.
And the great number of exhibitors from all countries, the "one hard to ask" is the greatest recognition and best response to China in a wider, wider field, deeper development of an open economy.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries build walls of trade protectionism, return to unilateralism, increasing the concerns of the international community about free trade prospects and adding many uncertainty to the world economy that is warming.
In this context of this era, this event on the side of Huang Po River reflects China's defence of free trade, showing the world the open market, sharing the confidence of the future and China.
Let's go alone, go away.
China has opened its hearts and embraces the world, not only strongly promoting its own development, but also offers a great "China opportunity" to all nations and regions of the world.
In recent years, advocacy and promotion of a "way road" has initiated the creation of the Asian Investment Bank and the establishment of the Silk Road Fund China has provided a range of international public products that provide real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, and allow businesses to take China's fast-track "car " .
The Expo is a public product, a platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises in more than 130 countries and territories have come up with a bright spot of high-quality products and services, and have taken a new step in the Chinese market.

By building this platform for "excellent progress", consumption upgrades provide a multi-channel quality supply to meet people's individualization, diversity and differential consumption needs.
As China opens its doors, the more the goods flow, the things will be more solid.
From a more macro point of view, the significance of the Expo has gone beyond the economic and trade context, but to look at the future, to convey the concept of openness, inclusion, inclusiveness, balance, win-win, and create consensus on a common response to today ' s challenges.
The world is good, China is good; China is good, the world is better.

Over 90% of Brazilian female voters say that the presidential candidate did not consider female needs.
According to the South American Aliens Network, recent data published by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE) show that over 90 per cent of Brazilian women do not consider the needs of women.
According to reports, Brazil has now reached 107 million women, and if we bring together all Brazilian women into a country, the country's population will be ranked 13th in the world, twice as high as the Spanish population.
In Brazil, women voters account for 52 per cent of total voters, 48% of men, and although women are very high among voters, only 10% of women in the Brazilian Congress.
In 193 countries around the world, Brazilian women are ranked only 154th in politics, higher than Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of rights struggle, Brazilian women still fail to acquire their rights.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori has pointed out that the reason for this phenomenon is the result of the common role of ancient patrilineal societies, racism and capitalist values.
" Politics should have been a national advocate of civil rights, identity, access to public goods and form the same society by a number of social groups ... But Brazilian politics is a monopoly of a particular group, and the majority of the population is not represented ... "
A previous study by the Brazilian Institute of Motorcycles (Locomotiva) also noted that 94 per cent of Brazilian women do not feel that elected politicians can represent their rights, 90 per cent of Brazilian women disagree with politicians and 93 per cent of women disagree with current government governance policies.
"We need to reverse the lack of representation of women in Parliament, and the political system in Brazil remains affected by inequality ... To date, there has been serious gender, class and racial discrimination in the political sphere of Brazil ... " Natalia Mori says.
Despite the lack of women ' s rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey showed that 76% of women thought they could make a difference in democratic elections, and 72 per cent were politically interested.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democracy is the best way to make women less biased.

Its importance is not only due to its importance to the profitability of the enterprise and the purchasing power of consumers, but also because of the increase in salaries or causing overall inflation, which may upset officials of the United States Federal Reserve (FeB/FED).
"The pay will be of great concern, as it may rise significantly over the previous month.
The increase in September over the same period of the previous year may not exceed 3%, but we can fully expect to break through next month, " The Dutch International Group (ING) economists wrote in a study ...

The main wind in the port pool, the maximum wind speed is up to 24 knots, and the launch signal was delayed for almost 90 minutes from 1 p.m. on 30 p.m., and the speed of the wind is still low, and the game is still low, and the game is being cancelled by the first day of the game, and the race will be postponed until the afternoon of October 1.
"The wind from the shore continues, and the sea is so intense."
Mdlandt explained: " In such cases, no one knows when the wind will hit the ship with the wind.
The race near the city is the wisest option to cancel the game in terms of the current wind. "
All ready crews are still a little disappointed.
"The ship is ready to stop, and we're in good shape."
Qingdao's rudder Max Richardson said, " But I know that the re-election of the game is the right choice and hope that the wind is smaller today, and we can do it. "

Despite the persistence of the global financial market, the Hong Kong Financial Authority stated on Monday that foreign exchange funds had fallen by 97 per cent annually in the third quarter of this year, better than the performance of the previous season, as a result of the high water in overseas stocks and significantly narrowed foreign exchange losses.
According to the latest data from the Authority, the foreign exchange fund recorded HK$1.6 billion in investment income in July-September 2018, significantly lower than HK$ 61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than HK$ 100 million revised in the second quarter of this year.
At the Legislative Council, Chen Deok-chul, President of the Gold Authority, stated that at the beginning of the China-United States trade war, Hong Kong and Emerging Market Stock Index was contrary to the United States stock index, until the end of September, when the United States stock market index had been at its peak, and that market sentiment had begun to reverse, as investors became aware that trade wars had also been bad for the United States itself.
"The change in market sentiment is good, and if trade wars have only unilateral effects, it will not help much to solve things ... "
But he also noted that " financial market volatility will continue to rise if the trade war between China and the United States has not been resolved ... "
In the third quarter of this year, foreign exchange funds lost their equity investments in Hong Kong by 8 to HK$4.7 billion narrower than the previous season, while the return on overseas equity investments increased by 172 to HK$12.8 billion; foreign exchange losses of HK$16.2 billion, with a reduction of HK$9.7 billion in bonds, a decrease of 24 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively, reflecting a general increase in the United States dollar against major currencies during the season and the United States interest rate rose by 3 cents in mid-September.
Foreign exchange funds are mainly used to support HK$.
Hong Kong has introduced a system of exchange rates linked to HK$ to the dollar since 1983.
For the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Deok-chul claims that economic and asset market uncertainty has increased, with increased lower risks, but the financial system is robust and defensive and earthquake resistance is sufficient.
" Hong Kong ' s international investment position is sufficient, with a net external asset value of $1.4 trillion equal to four times the GDP, 2.5 times more than Singapore and 0.6 times Japan, with more than enough to cope with the lower economic cycle or reversal ... "
Recently, the Hong Kong dollar break-off continued and expanded with the dollar spread, and Chen Deok-ho noted that the Hong Kong dollar exchange price had risen by over 400 basis points on 21 September, which was generally considered primarily related to the rise in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, and that the post-Hong Kong dollar to the level around 7.80-7.84, and that the recent Hong Kong dollar break interest rate had continued to fall, and that the increase in the interest rate between the United States dollar and the increase in the interest rate of the United States dollar could attract the market to buy United States dollars and increase in the interest rate of the United States dollar, and that the opportunity for Hong Kong dollar to trigger a weak exchange guarantee is greater than some time ago.
But he believes that as the Hong Kong bank interest rate starts, the normalization of Hong Kong dollar interest rates will change in the future rate below the dollar interest rate.
" Hong Kong dollar interest rates will be more consistent with the trend of interest rates in the United States dollar, and you must be more careful to manage risks and prepare to cope with market fluctuations ... "
As Hong Kong dollar funds are well funded, Hong Kong dollar breakback further, with a drop of 0.9 per cent to 2.08179 per week on three months, and the difference between the United States dollar interest rate was extended from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; the monthly break was five months low, and the difference between the United States dollar interest rate was increased from 120 to 127 basis points.
From May to September, the HK dollar spot exchange rate was close to $7.85 to $1 for most of the time.
During this period, the weak exchange guarantees were triggered several times in May and August after the completion of the interest-set and large equity campaign.
The Authority bought Hong Kong dollars at 7.85 levels according to the contact exchange rate system and sold the United States dollar to maintain the stability of the HK$ exchange rate.
The Authority bought approximately HK$52.1 billion under the weak exchange guarantee mechanism in May and August.

There is no threshold for Moonko Center: Quality certification leads to quality improvement.
With the pull of the "two-child economy", the booming of the mother and child market, from the north to the three-four-line cities, there were a variety of moon-child clubs.
The current hot moon club meets the demand for consumption of the population, ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands or hundreds of thousands, but is also in an awkward situation, and the agency has no threshold and there is still a gap in regulation.

At the same time, to meet the needs of new mothers, from the early days of Tsukiko to services such as mid-morning American care, etc., provide care such as Chinese medicine for beauty, to help mothers recover their positions.
A new mother in the house told the press that she had booked this Moonko club eight months early.
The services of the Tsukiko Club directly affect the comfort and physical recovery during the mother's moon, and some small moonhouses can only provide simple moon services, with disinfecting hygiene, vulnerability to cross-infection, single non-scientific problems.
The head of the Tsukiko Center said they were the only B-class service certification in all five star-class moon centres in Tianjin City.
" While some clients initially do not understand the meaning of B-level certification, it is important for the long-term development of the enterprise through certification of strict standardized process management. "
Pan Livin, Deputy Director of the Department of Certification and Regulation of the National Market Regulatory Authority, said that service certification was based on customer perception, a new certification system focused on the quality management and service characteristics of the organization, which was an important component of the national quality infrastructure, and was active in increasing the international competitiveness of services in China.
Since 2004, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has experienced an influential service certification, such as financial services certification, certification of mother and child care services, after-sales services, e-commerce service certification, health service certification, etc.
According to the National Market Regulatory Authority, there are currently over 130 service certification bodies, over 2,000 service certification officers and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates.
Pan Livin said that it was important to further guide and promote the development of service certification, and to gradually expand service certification coverage in areas such as health, education, sports, finance, electricians, to promote service supply-side reform and quality improvement.
Reuters Hong Kong, November 5th - Hong Kong building prices have returned for two months after the top of the table, and Chen Deok-chun, President of the Hong Kong Financial Authority, stated on Monday that it would take time to observe whether the city had entered the lower cycle, and if confirmed, the tight policy of relaxing the reverse cycle measures could be considered at the appropriate time.
Chen Deok-chul also said that if the price of the building goes back, the first person who will be in the industry at the peak of the building, but it is expected that the price of the building fell sharply as the Asian financial storm in 1997, and the chances of selling property are significantly lower.
Chen Deok-chul led several senior management authorities to the legislative briefing, saying that if the city was confirmed that the city had entered the fall cycle, measures could be relaxed as appropriate.
"But now only a few weeks of data, relaxing is still early, and it still takes more time to see if the city is entering the lower cycle. "
Since 10 October 2009, the Authority has so far introduced eight rounds of counter-cycle measures to significantly tighten mortgages of various properties, including reducing mortgages, and mortgage applicants are required to adopt rigorous pressure tests to enhance bank risk management and earthquake resistance.
With Hong Kong officially entering the interest rate-raising cycle, the price index for private housing buildings in August-September was at the top for two months in a row, and the monthly decline in September increased to 1.44%.
But the cumulative increase in the first three seasons of this year is still 10.2%.
According to the Authority, the financial situation of households measuring the resilience to financial risks in Hong Kong remains healthy, with Hong Kong households without mortgages at 66 per cent, higher than the average 60 per cent in 2009-11; the average number of new mortgages and the rate of contribution to new mortgages was 47 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively, compared to 64 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively, compared to 64 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively, respectively.
But Chen Deok-chul said that high resistance does not mean that the citizens who have been set up will not be damaged by the economy, as property valuations fall and the first to be the first to buy buildings at the peak.
Although the Authority tightens bank lending to mortgage borrowers, entrepreneurs can also obtain high-scale mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Chen Deok-chul stated that, together with mortgage loans provided to developers, the number of borrowers' mortgages could be 85-90%, and that if the price of the building fell, negative assets (i.e. property market value fell below the total unpaid mortgage loan level).
However, the Vice President of the Kim Authority, Nguyen Guo-chun, stated that the authorities estimated that the total number of mortgages provided by developers was only 2-2.5 per cent of the total bank mortgage, which remained low.
At the peak of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, or 22% of the number of people serving buildings.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong had recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive seasons.

Systematic red lupus is a chronic suspicion of exhausting and full-body multi-dirty, which was once considered "indigent."
There is no root for treatment due to the unknown mechanism of the disease, the lack of effective treatment.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the University of Tsinghua School of Life Sciences, and the Director of the Rheumatism Centre for Rheumatism, Beijing University People ' s Hospital, found that there was an increase in the molecular mutation of human immunoglobins, and this mutation was involved in the regulation of immuno-B cells.

It's not short, it's legal.
The lawyer took the axe to court?
The news was really exciting at first glance and blew up the pot in the legal circle.
The Chinese law of Fujianquan State then fined the lawyer for $500 and, in writing, recommended that the Quanzhou Bar Association be investigated.
According to the New Kyoto newspaper, the former Quanzhou Council issued a formal notice that the conduct of the two lawyers did not involve violations and that they were not punished by law.
From a wide range of reports, the Quanzhou Law Association is not short or confrontational, but has been recognized by the Spring State Central Court.
An event that could have caused tension within the legal community was finally properly resolved.
The reversal of the matter is based on a more complete truth: the axes carried by the lawyer are the same as the murder weapon of the accused, the same model, but not the blade, but only the evidence of the testimony, without intimidation or the subjective intent of "risking court safety".
There are four very important details to determine whether the lawyer ' s conduct is illegal and requires attention: one, the local court has held two previous sessions, showing only an axe photographs, from a defence point of view, showing the need for the axe; second, the axe was purchased one hour before the trial, not to seek the consent of the judge, but was objectively unable to contact the judge; and third, the entire axe was not over-used or inappropriately; and fourth, the lawyer, publicly recognized it in the first time and expressed his apology to the court.
The combination of these circumstances shows that the lawyer "with an axe" is not a crime, just to defend.
After clarifying the whole facts, the Quanzhou Council did not push the boat, but took the pressure to make a decision to keep it from punishing.
And this decision can stand the test of facts and laws.
As for bringing an axe to court as a control knife without court permission, it is indeed a source of anxiety and misunderstanding.
For safety and caution, the previous fine penalties and judicial advice of the Quanzhou Central Court are not very generous.
In order to preserve the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from being in trouble with lawyers, the Supreme Act issued the " Rules for the Security Inspection of Judicial Police in the People ' s Court " in 2014, which established the principle that lawyers do not require physical security checks in court.
Since the rule was issued, lawyers have taken the rules, and few incidents have occurred as a result of security gaps that endanger court safety.
In very individual examples like Quanzhou, it is not difficult to get rid of it if it communicates in a spirit of respect and understanding.
The Bar Association, as a self-regulation organization in the Bar Industry, has a dual mission to discipline the wrong law and to guarantee legal law.
Previously, individual regulatory organizations were suffering from disease because of their focus on discipline and lack of security.
And the decision of the Quanzhou Law Association, both in terms of process and results, is commendable and set an example for the correct performance of the Association.
From October 1, which taxes will affect our money bags?
The new personal income tax law of 1 October Shanghai, which will be introduced on 1 January 2019, will be introduced as soon as possible for the general population to enjoy tax cuts as soon as possible, the actual salary income of taxpayers will be reduced at the starting point of $5,000 per month and apply a new tax scale.

To this end, the tax authorities have provided the corresponding tax calculation function, which is being promoted in a uniform manner, but the corresponding taxes are still to be declared during the statutory declaration period.
Good two: Low tax slot is clearly high.
In addition to raising the starting point, a new tax scale will be applied as of 1 October.
The seven-story tax rate for this wage, which is consistent with the previous period, has not changed significantly, but the distance of the tax rate has changed significantly, 3%, 10%, 20% low tax rate, 25% lower tax range, while 30%, 35%, 45%, and the level distance of the three high tax rates remains unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax code has also adjusted the tax rate for production and operating income, of which the lower limit of 35 per cent of the highest tax rate has increased from $100,000 to $500,000.
This means that individual business and individual sole partnerships will benefit from tax changes.

The three-way trade agreement between America and America will bring new opportunities to 500 million people.
According to foreign media reports, a joint statement by Canadian Foreign Minister Friland and the United States Trade Representative Letshize, published on the Canadian Government website, stated that the United States, Canada and Mexico had reached a three-party trade agreement, which would be called "USMCA " (USMCA).
Previously, Canadian CTV News quoted senior American sources that Canada and the United States had eliminated differences and reached agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

The three countries began this negotiation process in 2017.
The results of the early Okinawa election for the death of the former Governor's illness were announced in the morning of 1st local time, and Danny, who opposed the relocation plan for the United States military base in Japan, was successfully elected.
The election voted on September 30th, and the final results show that Yu City won 39,66.32 million votes, the highest number of votes in Okinawa County, more than 80,000 more votes than his main campaign opponent, Sae-jin.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a turnout of 63.24%, a decrease of 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 Okinawa County Supervisory Elections.
On 1st day, Yu City stated to the media that the results of the election showed that the county people did not want the Governor's efforts to waste their efforts, and that he would inherit the Governor's legacy and continue to work towards the Japanese Government and the United States Government on the closure of the U.S. military base relocation plan and the closure of the universal base.
The U.S. military base in the city of Ino Bay, Okinawa County, has been ill, and the Japanese government has previously agreed to move it to the ancient area of the famous city, but Okinawa is strongly opposed and hopes to completely move the base out of Okinawa.
In response to the relocation plan strongly opposed by the county people and the withdrawal of permission to fill the sea on the border coast, Yu City stated that he had not been in a position against and divided with the central government at first, hoping that the parties would fully exchange views and demonstrate the intention to resolve through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Abe also stated to the media on the morning that it would be taken seriously and will work on the revitalization of Okinawa and reducing the burden of the base.

He also expressed his intention to talk to Yu City.
Yu City will be officially the director of Okinawa County on 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, with China's demand for oilseeds, Paul Thomas, a North Dakota farmer in the United States, has grown more and more soybeans in his land.
This shift peaked this year, and he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres, reaching unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and many farmers like him planned to replant the main food crops in the former American agricultural zone in 2019: corn and wheat.
American farmers grow more soybeans this year than corn for the first time in 35 years.
Other food crops are planned because American farmers are in trouble selling soybeans in the context of US President Trump's trade war against China.
China usually buys about 60 per cent of the United States exports soybeans, but because of the trade war, almost zero American soybeans have fallen to a ten-year low.
Thomas is going to grow more wheat next year, hoping to make more money by reducing dependence on crops that depend on China's needs.
Thomas says soybean prices are "a painful blow to us."
He said that without Chinese purchases, the spot price of soybeans near its farm was $7.10 per bun ear, while the cost of coverage was $8.50.
American farmers have a record high area of soybean cultivation this year, and the harvest is expected to be high.
At such a time when they were vulnerable, they were hit by a trade war.
China imposed import duties on imports of Chinese goods by Trump in July.
The United States Department of Agriculture will issue its first estimate of the area planted next year, which will include considerations on tariff implications.
It is expected that this estimate will confirm the expectations of a reduction in the area of soybean seeding by private institutions.
According to a report seen by Reuters, Informa Economics predicted that corn cultivation would increase by 4 per cent to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in 2019 and soybean cultivation by 7 per cent to 83 million acres.
Informa also expects a 4% increase in wheat cultivation in the United States.
The area of soybeans planted before the retaliatory customs duties rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres higher than 10 years ago.
Corn cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008, to 89.1 million acres, and this year wheat cultivation is 47.8 million acres, nearly the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, President of the Illinois Corn Cultivation Association, has a total area of 3,600 acres, and nearly half this year he's used to grow soybeans, but plans to cut in the future.
He claims that corn cultivation could be increased by up to 20% on his farm in northern Illinois; the state was the largest soybean growing state in the United States.
Soybeans produce less than corn per acre, but less fertilizer is needed, which makes soybeans generally less expensive.
If farmers move to end-value corn, they may increase costs, but will benefit some businesses, including Andersons Inc fertilizer sellers.
Executive Director Pat Bowe of Andersons said to Reuters that he expected that transplanting corn would facilitate fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the transfer of corn by farmers.

Xinhua International Times Review: Defence of Multilateralism, China knows one.
In the moment of unilateralism, international rules and multilateral order have been hit.
In a way, unilateralism and multilateralism have entered a critical period.
As responsible Power, China, with a strong approach and strong action, together with the international community, promotes multilateralism and promoting multilateralism.
In the face of new challenges in the new situation, China has made a loud voice on the direction and path of multilateralism.
As Wang Yi, Member of State and Foreign Minister for Foreign Affairs, in his speech on the general debate of the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism of the new era should insist on cooperation win-win, based on rule order, based on a rule order, based on justice and effective action.
At the same time, China calls for the construction of a global development cooperation pattern, which complements the United Nations as its core, North-South cooperation, and calls for a common effort to build a community of human destiny.
China's thinking and call reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As Espinosa, President of the 73rd session of the General Assembly, said, " the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism more than ever and maintain a rule-based international system " .
According to the President of the International Monetary Fund, Lagarde, the international community should continue to uphold the multilateral trading system, uphold international trade rules and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the global economic and political forces, the rise of emerging markets and developing countries have played a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms, providing new drivers of development for multilateralism that has experienced the reverse wind.
On this dimension, China advocates to build a big family rather than a small circle, insisting on the idea of multilateralism such as co-business building rather than winnings, and following the currents of times, is the inevitable choice to address global challenges and solve world challenges, representing the common claims of most countries in the world.
There's advanced ideas, more solid action.
China's "Away the Way" initiative has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
International and regional cooperation initiatives such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, 16+1 Cooperation to promote international regional cooperation, improve existing international systems and order, bring innovation to multilateral cooperation and contribute to the promotion of international order in a more just and rational direction.
As defenders of the international order and the practitioners of multilateralism, China's actions are becoming stronger in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Good offices international hotspots, addressing climate change, participation in peacekeeping operations, strong poverty reduction and helping other countries implement the sustainable development agenda 2030.
As the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Gutierrez, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the world faces a "trust deficit" increases, when populism and polarization trends rise, it is the most urgent moment of the world's need for multilateral cooperation.
At such a historical juncture, the international community needs to join forces to turn consensus into action, to defend multilateralism and to promote a community of human destiny.

Experts believe that the public awareness of the disabled groups in China has been at an in-depth level.
China ' s comprehensive sex education for persons with disabilities, especially children with disabilities and adolescents, is not deeply affected by traditional ideas.
However, in recent years, with the support of UNESCO and pro bonoists, the comprehensive development of sexual and reproductive health education practices and paths for persons with disabilities in China has developed throughout the cycle.

Reuters Beijing September 30th - The Central Bank of China released data on the scheduled short-term flow of foreign currency assets on Sunday, showing that as of the end of August this year, the central bank's foreign currency was zero for 12 months in a row for long-term contracts and futures contracts, and there was still no position in the month.
The central bank ' s previous data show that as of the end of August last year, the central bank held a total of $6,044 million in foreign currency versus futures contracts and futures contracts, which remained unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; the size of the empty position in SDR was 4276 million SDRs.
Since then, the central bank's foreign exchange position has been zero.
The central bank first published the data at the end of March 2016; the data show that the central bank's foreign currency was in excess positions of $2,438 million in foreign currency for the long-term contracts and futures contracts at the end of February 2016, with an empty position of $2.89 billion.
For the first time, the data released at the end of October of the same year increased by $16,401 million to $4.5301 million.
The central bank has previously stated that foreign currency for the long-term and futures empty positions of the currency reflect mainly the long-term operation of the central bank with commercial banks to meet the needs of the enterprise foreign currency liability package, and that the long-term impact of central bank operations on future foreign exchange reserves will continue to provide long-term risk avoidance products according to the principle of need, and that central bank operations have less impact on future foreign exchange reserves.
On the night of September 20th, K158 trains were on the train, Joe, who read the third year in Jungzhou, to the crane wall.
A man on the train bought no tickets, but took her seat: " Shoot it."
Two hours of drive, the train chief advised him to remain invalid for an hour.
Eventually, a male passenger in the same car couldn't watch and pull the master up.
In the interest of the public, while most of the final results were condemned by the public, punished by the public security administration and even on the blacklist of good faith, the public still felt that it was not "remote": why not allow the bulls to be punished on the spot?
Why not prevent immoral or even illegal acts on the spot, but to punish them after?
And why is it just a male passenger who pulls it up?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police, and short-distance trains are usually not available; even if there is a policeman, the police are concerned about the possible scoundrel reaction of the bullies without taking forced measures to get off.
The repeated hegemonic events have made people realize that the bullies must be forced to be taken away or even punished to be a deterrent.
This requires that our train police take strong measures in time and that the train without the police should be configured as soon as possible to prevent and combat violations in a timely manner.

Activate rural consumption, to cleanse markets by normalization mechanisms, guide healthy consumption demand and increase farmers ' consumption.
Data show that the consumption potential of rural residents continues to be released, with retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5% in the first half of this year, increasing at 1.3 percentage points in towns.
In a poor village in a western county, there was only one convenience store in the village, and some of the goods seemed to have known each other, "Goldenfish" marked "Golden Oil", "Wong Chai" became "sweet milk" and "the mountains" were a lot of goods.
Over the years, similar phenomena have been exposed, and some rural bad goods have been named, similar packagings, and it's inevitable to be false.
A consumption survey published in a western city shows that rural businesses are having a serious problem with super-false goods, with 66 per cent of users buying fake goods at the sub-town supermarket, of which more than half of them are food.
The authorities are working on rural markets, and they're yelling, and why is Li Ghost still fighting?
Unlike urban markets, farmers have a relatively weak sense of power, plus a number of remote rural locations, in blind areas that are not enough to regulate, giving the poor goods a soil.
A commodity with multiple heads, some sector price, some pipe production, some piped markets, functional cross-cutting, annual fakes, centralized management of a wind, fakes, slowly coming out, just after old fakes, new fakes coming out.
Lack of long-lasting regulatory mechanisms, rural markets are difficult to cleanse, low cost of violations and high benefits, resulting in some illegal vendors who have led to the "uphill" brain, and some rural areas become "distortion markets".
From warm to small, farmers are moving towards development consumption.
Recently, the Party Central, the State Council issued "A number of comments on improving mechanisms for the promotion of consumer systems to further stimulate the potential of consumption of the population " , which proposes to promote the upgrading of the consumer ladder for rural residents, with the aim of allowing the vast majority of farmers to " be able to consume " want to consume " and to make rural consumption truly flourish.
On the one hand, we need to deepen reforms to eliminate market regulation, multiple management disadvantages, because of local adaptation, sound food safety, product quality monitoring networks, constantly compressing rural fakes, selling fake space.
On the other hand, to increase law enforcement and control the "favorite veins" will never allow for false hypocrisy to spread in rural areas.
The severe punishment of pit farmers is the farmer, regardless of the hidden hideout of the fake, should not be the reason for the breeding of false goods, and the authorities should be clearly responsible, and which is the problem with which the problem is held accountable, and the fakes are not allowed to hide.
Strict market access, strict qualification of producers, market circulation, direct access to products, clear the way, from the source, root, to keep the legitimate distributors safe and to buy them.
Activate rural consumption to guide healthy consumption needs.
With the upgrading of consumption, many farmers seek not only to eat, eat well, but also to live of high quality, such as culture, health, and cannot bring rural markets with the "low quality" painting.
This requires the promotion of e-commerce coverage to a wide range of rural areas, open access to two-way distribution channels in urban and rural areas, to promote the integration of sub-line industrial development platforms and online electrician trading platforms to support the expansion of new patterns of consumption to rural markets; promoting the integration of new patterns of consumption to rural markets; promoting the integration of new patterns of consumption to rural markets; and promoting the integration of storage facilities and effectively reducing the cost of rural circulation.
Creating a clear, secure market environment for rural areas that keep farmers from consumption, and rural consumption is growing to increase farmers' consumption and happiness.
As of 1 November, the total tariff level will be reduced to 7.5 per cent for some of our commodities.
According to the decision of the 26th Standing Meeting of the State Council, the Customs and Tax Commission of the State Council issued a bulletin on 30th, reducing the best-favoured national tax rate for some commodities as of 1 November 2018.
According to the State Council Customs and Tax Commission ' s bulletin on reducing some imports of goods " , in order to adapt to industrial upgrading, reduce business costs and meet the demand for multi-level consumption of the population, as of 1 November this year, the most favourable tax rate for goods such as some industrial goods has been reduced.
The total number of tax cuts was 1585 taxes, about 19% of the total number of taxes in our country, and the average tax rate fell from 10.5 to 7.8 per cent, and an average decrease of 26 per cent.
The tax reduction is mainly related to textiles; stone, ceramics, glass products; some steel and cheap metal products; electromechanical equipment and parts such as metal processing machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, transmission equipment, electrical equipment, instrumentation, etc.; resource commodities and commodity processors, such as non-metal ore, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, jade stones, etc.
At the same time, with the overall tariff level, especially medicines, the tax rate on imports of daily consumer goods has been reduced accordingly.
To implement the Party ' s central, the State Council ' s decision-making deployment, we have imposed zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported medicines as of 1 May this year, reducing the import duties on cars and parts, some of the daily consumer goods, and the third step reduction of the information technology agreement to expand the product.
Journalists learned from the State Council Customs and Tax Rules Committee that since this year, after several consecutive autonomous adjustments, our total tariff level has dropped from 9.8 per cent to 7.5% in the previous year, an average of 23%.
Appropriate reduction of tariffs is conducive to promoting balanced development of foreign trade, promoting higher levels of openness and integration of both international and domestic resources to advance domestic supply-side structural reforms.
The relevant heads of the Commission stated that this year was the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, and that the overall level of duty reduction was a practical action by the General Secretary-General of the Near-Ping in the Bogang Asia Forum and was an important initiative for further expansion of its own high-quality development needs to expand its import, which shows that China will remain firmly unswerving open and win-win open strategies, and that China will develop better for the world while enhancing its own development motivation.

According to the Chinese Embassy website in Mongolia, on November 5, Chinese citizens Guo Yu Yi and Mao Yun Xin have recently lost contact during the Monk tour.
It is understood that two members of the Blue Sky rescue team, who contacted his family and friends on October 19, said they were about to explore the mountains near Lake Kusugure and share their location through micro-credit, and then lost contact and suspected of heading for no-man zone.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of legitimate interests and security of citizens in Mong China, with great importance to consular protection and assistance.
After learning about the failure of the two tourists, the embassy immediately launched the security emergency plan, trying to capture the golden rescue time and do its full work.

At the same time, the Embassy assisted families in publishing a search for people and widely launching active participation in the search of people in Monhua and Chinese enterprises, providing effective clues and providing assistance to several Blue Sky rescue workers who have been assisted in rescue.
With the strong push of the embassy, the first rescue team was sent by Mong Fong and promised to exempt the search and rescue costs.
The General Police Department and the Emergency Department have instructed Kusugur police and emergency departments to complete their efforts to search and rescue.

Meanwhile, in response to the special circumstances of herds, Monfang has been publishing a search for people through the radio cycle for many days.
The domestic Blue Sky rescue team has also arrived to participate actively with Mong.
The safety of the two lost men has always touched our hearts.
So far, the two people have been out of contact for over a decade, and the embassy has received some leads, but they have not yet found them, and the search and rescue operation is still under tension.
The Embassy will always keep an eye on the matter, with the principle of "people-centred" and promote the continued full search and rescue of the client and providing maximum assistance to the families of the parties.
The Embassy calls for information on our fellow citizens and businesses, and if you have any leads, please contact the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia first.
