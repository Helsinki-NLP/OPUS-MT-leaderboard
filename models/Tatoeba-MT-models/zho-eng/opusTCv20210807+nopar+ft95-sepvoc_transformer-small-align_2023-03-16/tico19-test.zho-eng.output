The cumulative incidence of new coronary virus diseases in the EU/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (COVID-19) increased rapidly between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of new coronary virus diseases (COVID-19) in countries of the EU/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom shows similar trends that confirm that while different countries are at different stages, the COVID-19 epidemic is rapidly developing.
According to Italian experience, the state, hospitals and intensive care wards need to be more prepared to meet a surge in COVID-19 patients, with a particularly serious care mission.
On December 31, 2019, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, reported several cases of pneumonia unknown causes.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control reported that the pathogen was a new coronary virus, now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus 2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was named coronary virus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that about 80% of COVID-19 cases are light, i.e. respiratory infections with or non-pneumonia, and most of them recover.
Of about 14% of cases, COVID-19 progressed for serious illness and need inpatient treatment, while the remaining 6% will progress on serious and intensive care.
The mortality rate for patients in hospital due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/European Economic Area, EU/European Economic Area, and in the UK (UK) and compared it with Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the number of existing COVID-19 cases in EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom between 31 January and 15 March 2020 compared to Italy.
EU/EA National and British COVID-19 cases
Following China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has been further expanded, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in other parts of the world are similar to China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the European Surveillance magazine, published on March 5, 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in Europe under the WHO case definition.
In EU/EA, France reported the first three confirmed cases on January 24, 2020, with patients returning to Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom had detected COVID-19 cases, including 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported from 31 December to 15 March 2019, including 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were reported in Italy alone.
Cumulative quantity and cumulative incidence of cases obtained COVID-19
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country around the world at 8:00 a.m. every day, which is available only through official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data have been used to assess trends in EU/EA and the United Kingdom COVID-19 and compared with Italy.
We calculated the cumulative incidence of 14 days in each EU/EA country and the United Kingdom COVID-19 cases between 1 January and 15 March 2020, as an indicator of the incidence of activity COVID-19 cases in order to consider the natural disease of COVID-19.
We also provided the total cumulative cases reported by each country as of 15 March 2020, at 8:00 a.m. and compared with Italian data from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
EU/EA Country and UK COVID-19 Trends
The trend in the 14-day constriction of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom is generally consistent with Hubei Province (China) (figure 1).
For EU/EA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 has increased since around 21 February 2020, followed by a sharp increase around 28 February.
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom has shown similar growth trends (additional materials).
Figure 2 shows the number of cumulative COVID-19 cases in EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom between 31 January and 15 March 2020 and compared with Italy.
It should be emphasized that as of March 15th, at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom had reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy in less than three weeks.
Our results show that the number of cases of COVID-19 reported by EU/EA and the UK is increasing rapidly.
The observed trend in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 shows that the epidemic is developing at similar speeds in all countries.
Although countries are at different stages, the national public health response varies, the definition of cases may vary from country to country and to choose that there are differences in programmes for patients who must be tested for COVID-19, including additional tests.
In early March 2020, according to doctors in affected areas in Italy, about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, while media reports indicate that hospitals and intensive care wards in these areas have reached maximum load.
At the EU/EA level, data currently available are only 6% and 1% of COVID-19 cases in hospital/or intensive care wards (data not shown).
However, this information should be collected systematically to complement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that there were significant differences between the number of intensive care and medium-term care beds available in European countries, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more resources than Italy (in 2010-2011, 12.5 intensive care and medium-term care beds per 100,000 people).
ECDC modelled the sixth update of COVID-19 rapid risk assessment, which models the associated scenes of health-care capacity and estimated the relationship between the incidence of each EU/EA country and the British resident COVID-19 patient and the risk of over severe care beds & gt; 90%.
Since cases have so far gathered in some regions of EU/EA countries and UK, hospitals and intensive care wards usually serve the population covered in the identified area, it is best to provide information on case and severe care beds at the "Standard Statistical Geographical Module 2" (NUTS-2).
The Italian experience and current trends in other countries show that the EU/EA and the British COVID-19 pandemic are developing rapidly.
Therefore, the State, hospitals and intensive care wards should be prepared to respond to the continued community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and increased number of patients in the need of health care, especially in severe care, such as those in affected areas in Italy.
As recent ECDC rapid risk assessment points out, fast, positive and comprehensive approaches are essential to slowing the spread of SARS-COV-2 and needs to be transitioned from containment to mitigation methods, as the rapid growth of expected cases may not allow policymakers and hospitals to understand, accept and adjust responses.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a short window of opportunity that countries may further increase control to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health care systems.
Otherwise, the health care system in other EU/EA countries is likely to face a surge in patients in need of intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
The outbreak of 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronary virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far infected more than 80,000 people in China and the rest of the world, causing more than 3,000 deaths, causing a huge human disaster.
Similar to its co-source virus SARS-CoV -- which caused thousands of people to infection with SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Although COVID-19 has a less serious and mortality rate than SARS, it is more contagious and more affected than young people and more men than women.
Given the rapid increase in publications related to new coronary pneumonia, this paper wishes to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving research topic.
We will present basic knowledge of epidemiology, pathology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, pre- and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this overview will help understand and eradicate this terrible disease.
The spring festival of January 25, 2020 became an unprecedented memory of the Chinese, and the outbreak of a new virus disease forced everyone to be out of their homes throughout the holiday and the subsequent weeks.
The virus was highly congenous with the coronary virus (CoV) that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) named SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the related disease is known as coronary virus disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began with Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country, and then spread to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in over 80,000 COVID-19 confirmed cases, of which more than 40,000 patients had been discharged and more than 3,000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 has become the number one public enemy, and its threat may exceed terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 papers on COVID-19 were published in less than two months since the first report of the separation of the virus sequence from multiple patients on 7 January 2020.
This paper aims to summarize the progress of research in this emerging field of disciplines.
People are used to comparing COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss the knowledge learned so far on the disease and pre-emptive issues, as well as some urgent issues to be addressed.
CoV was always considered to be a non-lethal pathogen for humans, causing about 15% of the common cold 4.
But the century has met two highly sick humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which broke out in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to many other countries, with terrible prevalence and mortality rates.
So this COVID-19 outbreak is the third CV outbreak recorded in human history.
As shown in figure 1, 1, Wuhan City first reported several unknown cases of pneumonia to the National Health and Health Commission of China on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was published.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the first death.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, medical staff infection was reported, indicating that there might be a human phenomenon.
On January 23, Wuhan City closed down and closed all public transport.
On January 24, the first clinical study on new coronary pneumonia, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the southern seafood market in Wuhanhua, which was considered the starting point for unknown sources of infection.
On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time the report was released, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (figure 2 (Fig.2)).
The final scope and gravity of the outbreak are yet to be determined as a result of the rapid development of the epidemic.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study for 8,866 patients (including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients) provided an updated description of the epidemic, as shown below (https://mp.weixin.q.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 can infect all age groups, but the main age group is 30-65 years.
Almost half of the infected (47.7%) are over 50 years of age, and very few are under 20 years of age, and only 14 infected persons are under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/10 million) are more than women (027/10 million).
COVID-19 is mainly sexually transmitted in Hubei and surrounding areas.
COVID-19 average 5 (2-9) days from disease to diagnosis.
Average insulation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from disease to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Basic regeneration (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased at an index level by January 23, 2020, in line with the large-scale population flow time before China Spring Festival.
The mortality rate for confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 are sex (men), age (60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large membrane virus sub-family with a single justice chain RNA.
They can be divided into four categories, alpha, beta, gamma and thorium, where alpha-CoV and beta-CoV are known to be infected with humans.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV's membrane stinging protein (S) are combined with their cell receptor blood vessels 2 (ACE2) and diazine 4 (DPP4), and then the membrane is integrated.
The virus RNA genome was released into the cell mass; after copying the virus genome, RNA formed a cyst with membrane sugar protein and nuclear shell protein, then integrated with the membrane and release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
As a result, SARS-CoV-2 was a new type of beta-CoV, with genetic consistency exceeding 99.98% of the 10 sequence samples collected from the southern Chinese seafood market in Wuhan City.
SARS-CoV-2 is more geneticly similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in super thin slices on the human airway by trans-radiation electron microscopes.
Research found that man ACE2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is weak in combination with human ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-2, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a serious infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins coded by orf3b and the orf8-coded protein.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in the disease of the virus and inhibit the expression of IFN beta; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional structure or base sequence.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. reported a frozen electron microscope (cryo-EM) structure of ACE2 for the trans-shipment of amino acid trans-shipment protein B0AT1 with a resolution of 2.9 thorium.
They found that the compound had an open and closed structure, assembled into a binary, and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could combine two S proteins, thus providing evidence of CV identification and infection.
B0AT1 could be a target for drug screening to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Origin and middle host
As you know, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and spread to humans through fruit beavers and camels, respectively.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other CoV systems, bats are considered natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is consistent with two SARS samples from bats, called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21, respectively.
But it is not clear what the middle host helps the virus to infect humans across the species barrier, and its transmission is yet to be explained.
Ji et al. suggested that snakes were carried from bats to humans, involving co-source reorganization within S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China believe that, given that a CV found in a mountain armor — a long kissed ant animal that is often used for Chinese medicine — is considered to be a potential middle host of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference between the two genomes remains a huge difference; therefore, the decisive results are yet to be provided by specific evidence (Fig.33).
The rational nature of SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro in the dry environment for 48 hours, and survive at up to 5 days at 20           .C and 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may be of a similar nature.
SARS-CoV-2 was reportedly sensitive to ultraviolet and heat-sensitive - 56  degrees - 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform and other lipid solvents can be effectively extinguished, but chlorine is no longer valid for the active virus.
There is a general lack of immunity for SARS-CoV-2, and therefore is easy to feel about this new virus.
Currently, there is no detailed study on SARS-CoV-2 immunization responses.
So we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Chart (Fig.4).
Generally, the virus is first identified by the host's inherent immune system through mode identification of receptor (PRR), including C-condensant sample receptor, Toll sample receptor (TLR), NOD sample receptor (NLR) and RIG-I sample receptor (RLR).
The virus is expressed through different circuits, the maturity of tree-student cells and the IFN synthesis, which limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the consumption of the virus's antigens.
But the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus get out of the immune response.
Adaptive immune responses will soon join the anti-virus.
T lymphoma cells, including CD4+ and CD8+T cells, play an important role in anti-virus defense.
CD4+T cells stimulate B cells produce virus-specific antibodies, while CD8+T cells directly kill infected cells infected with viruses.
Auxiliary T cells produce inflammation cell factors to help the defense cells.
But CoV can inhibit T-cell function by seducing T-cell decay.
Body immunity, including supplements, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, is also essential to resist virus infections.
For example, antibodies separated from recovered patients can be in the middle of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive reactions of the immune system can produce a large number of free foundations that can cause serious damage to lungs and other organs, in the worst cases, causing multi-organ failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a concentration of diseases, is more likely to affect older persons with multiple combined diseases and pregnant women.
Normally, the chances of infection of individuals exposed to a large number of viruses or immune functions are higher than others.
According to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the average insulation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated at 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average insulation period was 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
As noted earlier, a recent study shows that according to demographics of 8,866 cases, the insulation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
For the health sector, it is important to adjust effective isolation time to the most accurate insulation period, which prevents non-symmetric infections from spreading the virus to others.
As a custom, the virus is exposed or infected usually requires isolation for 14 days.
Should isolation be extended to 24 days?
Heat is usually the main and initial symptoms of COVID-19, with no other symptoms, or with dry cough, gas, muscle pain, dizziness, headaches, stomach pains, chest pains, diarrhoea, disgusting and vomiting.
Some patients have respiratory difficulties and/or low oxygen disease one week after the disease.
The serious ones will move rapidly as acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acid poisoning and condensation functional disorders.
Even without lung image anomalies, patients with heat and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should be screened for early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 shows that the percentage of symptoms is 98% heat, 76% dry cough, 55% breathing difficulties, 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients need air support.
Two recent studies on family concentration and individual transmission without symptoms have reported similar results.
In contrast, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also use heat (98%), dry cough (47%) and respiratory difficulties (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them need air support, much more than COVID-19 patients, which match the death rate of MERS higher than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and swallow pains (21%) were also observed among MERS patients.
Among SARS patients, heat has been proven (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), respiratory difficulties (40-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and swallow pain (13-25%) are the main symptoms, with about 14%-20% of patients need air support.
As of 14 February, 66,576 cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed globally, with a mortality rate of 2 per cent.
In contrast, as of November 2002, SARS had a 10% mortality rate of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate of 2,494 confirmed cases was 37%.
An early study reported that R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47,95 per cent confidence zone (CI) is 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 is only 2 to 4.
Table 1.1 shows the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0.
The above data show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher proliferation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter.
Therefore, controlling SARS-CoV-2 epidemics is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Gathering diseases usually occur in the same family, or from the same party or transport, such as cruise ships.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other epidemic areas within the last two weeks of the disease, or in close contact with the infected or patient.
However, people are reported to be able to carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and the cured patients who have been released from hospital can carry the virus again, thus sending alerts to extend the time of isolation.
The number of patients in the early stages of the disease is normal or reduced in the number of white cells (especially lymphoma cells).
For example, white cell count & lt; 4x109/L - including lymphoma count & lt; 1 x 109/L - were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, rising levels of amino acid transfer enzymes and virus blood disease.
Some patients can see a higher level of liver enzymes and myoglobins in blood, and most patients can see blood C reaction protein and blood deposition.
Heavy patients can see increased levels of blood fibre protein degradation and reduced lymphoma count.
Most COVID-19 patients can see chest image anomalies, characterized by double-sided film shadows or lung grinding glass.
Patients usually have atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrollable inflammation, liquid volume fusion and sexual fibrosis can seriously damage gas exchange.
The functional impairment of the skin cell on the I and II lung bubbles reduces the level of surface active agent and increases surface tension, thereby reducing lung expansion and increases the risk of lung collapse.
So the worst chest image discovery usually occurs at the same time as the worst extent of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathology analysis of COVID-19 found a lung bubble upper skin cell fall in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, transparent membrane formation, inter-mass lymphoma cell leaching and polynuclear cell cells, consistent with virus infections and ARDS pathology performance, similar to SARS and MERS patients.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been used as the main standard for diagnosis of COVID-19 by reverse the polymer chain reaction (RT-PCR).
However, as high false negative rates may accelerate the epidemic, China began to diagnose clinical performance on February 13, 2020 (not simply relying on RT-PCR).
Similar situations occurred when they diagnosed SARS.
Therefore, combining the history of the disease, clinical performance, laboratory tests and videoological results are essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Zhang Feng team reported a scheme to test SARS-CoV-2 using CRISP-based SHERLONK technology, which, without complex instruments, can detect a concentration of only 20 x 10-18 mo/L to 200 x 10-18 mu/L (per microlitre 10-100 virus copy) in less than an hour.
If validated in clinical samples, this new technology is expected to significantly increase the sensitivity and convenience of diagnosis.
Because of the lack of experience in treating new CoVs, doctors mainly support treatment for COVID-19 patients, while trying to use or propose various treatments for other CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments, such as antivirus drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support for recovered patients.
Even suggest that the plasma of the recovered patient be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing for antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 started with a major attack on lungs and may also express other organs of ACE2 at a lower level, such as gastrointestinal systems and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory disorders and failure are the main threats to patients and the main cause of death.
As a result, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and saving lives, including conventional oxygen, high flow oxygen, non-inventive and mechanical ventilation, depending on the extent of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must be supported by an in vitro membrane oxygen (ECMO), an improved CPR sideway technique for treating life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolytic balance, preventing and treating re-emergence and septic shock and the protection of critical organ functions are essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
As you know, the immune system of SARS and MERS patients overreacting can cause cell factor storms.
Cell factor storms are a form of a whole-body inflammation reaction, characterized by a range of cell factors, including TNF alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IFN alpha, IFN beta, IFN gamma and MCP-1.
These cell factors induce immune cells to release a large amount of free base, which is the main cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunization inhibition is essential in the treatment of cell factors storm, especially among patients with severe illness.
Cortical steroids and beads mono-resistant -- an anti-IL6 monoclon antibodies -- have been used to treat cell factor storms.
Other immunosuppressive therapy for cell factors storms include: regulation of T-cell orientation immune responses; blocking IFN-gamma, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; Bonato mono-anti; cell factor signal transfer inhibitor 4; and HDAC inhibitor.
steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants to treat SARS to reduce the extent of inflammation damage.
But large doses of steroids are not beneficial to severe lung damage to SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they may cause serious side effects, especially the death of anaemia, which seriously affects the post-preparation.
Nevertheless, short-range treatment is recommended for the use of low- and medium- and low-dose cortex steroids by patients with severe stress.
At the time of writing, no effective anti-virus therapy has been confirmed.
However, Redswell, a similar nucleic acid, has been found to be effective for a COVID-19 patient in the United States.
Redswell was a new anti-virus drug developed by Gilid, initially used to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, it proved that Redswell might contain other single-chain RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
For these reasons, Gilid has provided the drug to China for two clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons, and the results are promising.
In addition, the use of Barricktini, alpha-interference, Lopinave/Litonaway and Libaverin is recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
There may be diarrhoea, disgusting, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions after the joint treatment of Lopinave/Litonavi.
The interaction between these treatments and other drugs used by patients should be carefully monitored.
Blood and antibodies generation of recovered patients
Blood collected blood from patients recovering from infectious diseases for treatment of other patients with the same disease or protecting healthy individuals from infection for a long time.
In fact, recovered patients usually contain relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood against pathogens.
Antibodys are an immunoglobin (Ig) produced by B lymphoma cells to combat pathogens and other alien objects that identify unique molecules in pathogens and directly and directly and directly and directly and directly.
Based on this principle, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of recovered COVID-19 patients and then injected them to 10 people at risk.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, while they found that inflammation and virus loads were reduced and blood oxygen saturation increased.
However, before the development of specific therapy, validation and clarification is necessary to propose large-scale methods.
In addition, given the effects of treatment, some of the shortcomings associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immune reactions and cause cell factors to release syndrome, which may endanger life.
Antibody concentrations in blood are usually low, while there is a high demand for plasma for patients at risk.
It's hard to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, the more critical and practical approach is to separate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic passwords for valid antibodies coded, or screen effective antibodies for proteins necessary for viruses.
So we can easily expand the production of antibodies.
In China, the use of TCM to treat multiple diseases has been in existence for thousands of years.
However, its treatment effects depend to a large extent on the combination of multiple components of prescriptions, while prescriptions vary according to the TCM theory.
Most active ingredients are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their best combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with light to moderate symptoms or patients who have recovered from the severe stage.
For example, it has been found that the flue and the flower-cleaning capsule have been found to be effective for COVID-19 treatment.
In several provinces of China, 87% of patients use TCM treatment, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei only used TCM treatment in about 30% of COVID-19 patients, with the lowest treatment rate (13%).
However, this is just a rough comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number and gravity of patients, should also be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Zhang Burly and his colleagues published a study on the comparison of Western medicine (WM) alone with WM and TCM.
They found that the WM+TCM group temperature recovery, the time required for the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization was significantly shorter than the simple WM group.
Most impressively, the symptoms of the WM+TCM group (from light to heavy) are significantly lower than the simple WM group (7.4% against 46.2%) and the mortality rate of the WM+TCM group is equally lower than the simple WM group (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, TCM effectiveness and safety still require higher quality control tests, wider scope and more centres to confirm.
The mechanism of the role of the TCM treatment or its combination will also be of concern if possible.
Most of the patients suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 are afraid of this highly contagious or even lethal disease, and the quarantiners are bitter, lonely and angry.
Moreover, symptoms of infection, such as heat, oxygen deficiency and cough, and adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by cortex steroids, can increase anxiety and psychological distress.
A series of psychological reactions were reported at the early stages of the SARS outbreak, including continuing depression, anxiety, panic attacks, mental excitement, mental anxiety, mental symptoms, pretense or even suicide.
As part of the public health response to the outbreak of COVID-19, mandatory close contact tracking and isolation can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of transmission, isolation and stigma of their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, close contacts and the public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams to avoid close contact using specialized electronic equipment and applications through regular and accurate updating of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak information and treatment programmes.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain from animal hosts and infected patients to vulnerable hosts and is usually used as a complement to anti-virus treatment in controlling the epidemic caused by emerging viruses.
Industry has worked to develop S-based vaccines to generate long-term and effective neutral antibodies and/or protective immunizations for SARS-CoV.
The poison-reducing vaccine has been evaluated in SARS animal models.
However, prior to the launch of clinical research, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines has not been determined in the body of older persons and lethal assault models and their protection for co-virus infections.
It's probably because SARS disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, as a result of the persistence of common sources of human and animal disease in the area of the epidemic, there is a constant presence in the Middle East, and has continued to be widespread in the Middle East, and spread to other regions.
By using the use of anti-life viruses, DNA particles, virus carriers, nanoparticles, virus samples and recombined protein sub-kiss, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of safe and effective vaccines for non-immunized individuals for SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent and critical task in controlling the current epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome this difficulty due to the long periods of vaccine development (average 18 months) and the dynamic changes in CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its full clinical process among thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover, with no legacy.
But like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 patients have high prevalence and mortality rates.
Therefore, the establishment of a pre-model of the disease is essential for health-care institutions to set priorities for services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect the pre- and post-preparation of COVID-19 patients (table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor that affects SARS, as is COVID-19.
As noted earlier, in a study that included 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred mainly in the 30-65 age group, of which 47.7 per cent were over 50 years.
Patients in need of intensive care are more likely to have basic complications and complications and are significantly older than those who do not need intensive care (medium age 66 to 51 years), suggesting a pre-post factor in the end of the COVID-19 patient.
Gender: As mentioned earlier, more men infected with SARS-CoV-2 are more than women (0.31/10 million against 0.27 per million).
Merge and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to cause acute heart damage and heart disorders.
Heart incident is also the main cause of the death of SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be able to combine with ACE2 positive cholesterol cells, which could lead to liver disorders for COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age is closely linked to basic diseases and may interact with each other.
Laboratory tests are abnormal: C reaction protein (CRP) levels in blood reflect the extent of inflammation or tissue damage, which are considered to be disease, treatment response and potential pre-recovering factors for final recovery.
It was also suggested that the CRP level was relevant to the gravity of COVID-19 and the pre-emergence.
In addition, the rise of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the AST, the acetamine transfer enzyme (ALT) and the increase in myo acid hormones (CK) may also help predict the end.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver and released during tissue damage.
So they're traditional signs of heart or liver functional impairment.
Main clinical symptoms: time progress on chest image and clinical symptoms should be considered with other issues to predict the end and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As mentioned earlier, steroids are immunosuppressants, usually used as auxiliary treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the extent of inflammation damage.
Because large doses of cortex steroids are widely used for heavy SARS patients, many survivors suffer from anaemia, leading to life disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in small doses and short periods of COVID-19 patients.
Psychological stress: As mentioned earlier, many patients were under great pressure during the COVID-19 outbreak, because they often suffered long-term isolation and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of relatives and sick friends.
Psychological counselling and long-term support must be provided to help these patients get out of stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies to date, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 seem to be different from SARS.
In addition to copying in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively replicated in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or symptoms at the early stages of the infection, similar to other CoVs that cause ordinary colds.
As a result, the infected will produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities in the early or during the outbreak, causing great difficulties in controlling the epidemic.
However, the spread of SARS-CoV is considered to have occurred when the patient is in serious condition, and most of the transmission does not occur in the early stages.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and difficult to control than SARS.
China is currently making great efforts, including the blockade of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued isolation of almost all populations with a view to interrupt the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have caused serious damage to China ' s economy and other aspects, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating that the epidemic is slowing down.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March, and the decline will last 3-4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others estimate that COVID-19 is clearly more contagious than SARS and will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini et al. have established models to predict the consequences of the epidemic, which believe that SARS-CoV-2 may be infected with two thirds of the world's population.
A team in Canada reported that patients who recovered and released from hospital two weeks ago detected SARS-CoV-2 in mid-salary nails and swabs, indicating that this newly discovered virus could become a cyclical epidemic similar to influenza.
But with the decline in the number of new cases, China has shown encouraging signs that the current strategy may have worked.
Ebola virus was predicted to cause 1 million cases and 500,000 deaths.
But through strict isolation, the disease is finally controlled.
Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become less contagious, eventually disappearing or becoming less contagious viruses living with humans.
Here is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can be transmitted by coughing or sneezing, and may even be transmitted through direct exposure to contaminated items of the virus.
The virus was also found in the excreta, which increases the possibility of transmission of the excreta.
A recent study, which includes 138 cases, 41% of cases may have been caused by internal infections, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Therefore, more rigorous precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially those who have been in contact with patients or infected persons, especially medical personnel, social workers, family members, colleagues, even those who have had contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 dust masks (1860s series) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgery masks prevent liquid drops from being transmitted or attached to objects that may be passed to others from potential infected persons.
However, only N95 (1860s series) masks prevent the inhalation of viruses of up to 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of viruses fully penetrated; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV, both about 85 nm.
Because the virus particles can even penetrate five surgical masks that fold together, medical personnel who have direct contact with patients must wear N95 masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical personnel should wear quarantine suits to further reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 with a N95 mask; the virus may have entered it through inflammation eyes.
Therefore, medical personnel should also wear transparent masks or goggles in the face of patients.
For the public in areas affected by the epidemic or potentially affected by the epidemic, it is strongly recommended that all people use disinfected soap to wash their hands more frequently than usual, to remain in isolation and to limit contact with potential infected persons.
Three feet is considered to be a good distance from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of viruses.
Although SARS-CoV-2 was a new virus that broke into the human world, based on deep memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak, its high-level homogeneity with SARS-CoV, reported on January 7, 2020 should have caused high alarm in China.
But until January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan City Center for Disease Prevention and Control was still calming the citizens, saying that the new virus was not contagious, and that the possibility of human transmission was limited and that the epidemic was manageable.
This news clearly eases public alert and is coming to spring, and the epidemic is being missed at the key node of Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies may learn this painful lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these institutions should (1) be more cautious in publishing announcements, as each word is essential to citizens and can change their attitudes and decision-making; (2) more sensitive and responsive information from hospitals than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more stringent control of potential epidemics in the early stages than attempt to appease the public; and (4) more frequent targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of the epidemic and regularly test and improve social response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.
At the time of writing, in less than two months, it had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak looks like SARS.
But there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which is essential to controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
More older people affected by COVID-19 than young people, more men than women, and older patients have more severe and mortality rates than young patients.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Even without symptoms, COVID-19 patients can spread viruses, and SARS patients usually spread viruses when they are in serious condition, which makes it more difficult to control COVID-19 transmission than SARS.
This part explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads far faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 conventional RNA tests may be negative.
On the other hand, the cured patient may be re-emerging.
These discoveries have greatly increased the risk of virus transmission.
Taking into account the rapidness of research on COVID-19, the following key issues remain to be addressed:
SARS-CoV-2 from?
Although 96% of the genetic homogeneity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and the two bat SARS sample CoVs, we still cannot draw the conclusion of SARS-CoV-2 from bats.
What kind of animal is spreading the virus from the original host -- assuming bats -- to the middle host of mankind?
If we don't know the answers to questions 1 and 2, we can't effectively cut the channels of transmission and that the outbreak can re-emerge at any time.
Although molecular models and biochemical analysis have proven that SARS-CoV-2 is combined with ACE2, how does the virus accurately enter the airway cells and cause subsequent pathology changes?
Will the virus also combine cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
If these questions do not have a clear answer, we cannot achieve rapid, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve in the human process?
Will it become a global epidemic? disappear like SARS? Or will it re-emerge like flu?
Finding answers to the above and many other questions is essential, but it may take longer.
However, regardless of the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic and restore our lives to normal as soon as possible.
The origin of the human and animal disease of the coronary virus.
For thousands of years, mutation and adaptation have been driving the co-emergence of Coronaviruses, CoV and its host (including humans).
Before 2003, two types of human coronary viruses (HCOV) were known to cause minor diseases, such as common colds.
The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS has turned the situation and reveals the destructive and lethality of HCOV infection.
SARS-CoV-2, which appeared in central China at the end of 2019, once again made CoV a focus of attention, and it was surprising that it was more contagious than its sister virus SARS-CoV, but it was less contagious.
HCOV infection is a common disease, so it will be helpful to us to understand that the origin of HCoV's common disease.
Most HCoVs come from bats and are not sick.
Some HCoV intermediate storage hosts are also known.
Identifying animal hosts is directly meaningful for the prevention of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of the CV host in animals may also give us a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of human CV disease.
In this overview, we outlined the existing knowledge of seven HCOVs, highlighting their history of discovery, the origin of human and animal disease and inter-plant transmission.
What matters is that we compare and compare different HCOVs from the perspective of virus evolution and genome restructuring.
Against this background, we've explored the current 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19).
In addition, this paper focuses on the requirements for successful completion of host conversion and the effects of the evolution of the virus on the disease.
CoV belongs to the coronary virus section, consisting of a single-chain RNA virus with a membrane.
These viruses have the largest genome of the RNA virus, containing 2.6 to 32,000 base, known as CoV because of the coronary form under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoV has a non-sub-genomic that shares similar organizations.
About two thirds of the genomes contain two large overlapping open reading boxes (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab reproduction enzymes polyglobins.
These polyglobins have been further processed to produce 16 non-structured proteins called nsp1-16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs of structural proteins, including stinging (S), membrane (E), membrane (M) and nuclear protein (N).
Many spectrum-specific auxiliary proteins are coded by the CV of different spectrometry.
According to protein sequences, CoV is divided into four categories (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and thorium-CoV), of which beta-CoV contains most HCOVs and is broken down into four spectrum systems (A, B, C and D).
System development evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the genetic sources of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main hosts of gamma-CoV and thorium-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has been crossing species barriers, some of which have become important human pathogens.
So far, seven coronary viruses (HCOV) are known to be infected.
Of which HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Other 5 beta-CoVs include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronary virus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually cause minor symptoms, such as common cold and/or diarrhoea.
By contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly sick, causing severe lower respiratory infections among relatively more patients and more likely to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, ARDS) and extra-pulmonary performance.
In the mid-60s, the first HCOV-229E virus plant B814 was separated from the nose cavity of a common cold patient.
Since then, humans have accumulated more knowledge through extensive research on both HCoV-229E and HCOV-OC43 viruses that can cause self-restrictive symptoms.
In fact, before SARS broke out, the concept of infection of HCOV was usually widely accepted.
SARS, which broke out in 2003, was one of the most destructive events in history, infected with more than 8,000 people, with a crude death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, after the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory syndrome (MERS), the epidemic continued to spread on the Arabian peninsula and spread to other parts of the world.
2019 The new HCoV virus (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen of the ongoing prevalence of 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19), which has taken over 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people.
The alarm has been ringing and the world must be prepared for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
All seven HCOVs have the origin of human animals from bats, rats or domestic animals.
There's a variety of evidence that all HCOVs have evolved from bats, and the virus in bats is well adapted and non-pathetic, but it shows a great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has brought great medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracking the origin of the human and animal disease of HCOV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, drivers and constraints of the leap of virus species.
In addition, this will guide or promote the search for SARS-CoV-2 storage hosts, intermediate hosts and expanding animal hosts, which are important for preventing future virus spills.
In this overview, we outline the origin of the coV human and animal disease, inter-plant transmission and disease mechanisms.
In particular, we have highlighted and explored a common topic that HCOV's pro-generation virus is usually not sick among its natural storage hosts, but it is contagious after cross-species spread to Shinjuku.
In addition, we have reviewed the trend in the evolution of HCOV, where the increase in transmission is often accompanied by a reduction in disease.
Against this background, we also discussed the results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Since the late 1930s, the animal CoV has been widely known.
Before the first separation of HCOV-229E bacteria from the common cold patient's nose cavity, B814, medicalists had separated different CVs from infected animals (including turkeys, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs).
In the last few decades, seven types of HCOV have been discovered.
A brief summary of the history of HCOV discovery in time (table 1) will provide us with a wealth of information and guidance.
In 1966, the first HCOV-229E virus was separated from the respiratory tract of the upper respiratory infected patient and then adapted to growth in WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E have headaches, sneezes, discomfort, throat pains, common cold symptoms, 10-20% of patients with fever, cough, etc.
In the second half of 1967, HCOV-OC43 was separated from the organ culture of the mammoth brain and subsequent generations.
The clinical characteristics of HCOV-OC43 infection are similar to HCOV-229E infections, and there are no significant differences in symptoms from other respiratory pathogens (e.g. influenza A virus and nose virus).
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are distributed globally, mainly in the winter of the warm climate.
Usually, the two viruses have less than a week's insulation period, and then about two weeks later.
A study by human volunteers shows that healthy individuals infected with HCOV-229E have a mild common cold.
Only a few patients with low immune function show severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as "Atypical Pneumonia", is the first fully recorded pandemic in human history by HCOV, the pathogen of SARS-CoV, the third found HCOV.
The first SARS case dates back to Guangdong Province, China, late 2002.
SARS epidemic caused 8,096 reported cases, 774 deaths, spread to many countries and continents.
In addition to super-transmitters, it is estimated that each case may result in about two subsequent cases, with a period of 4-7 days, with a peak of virus load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV were initially shown as muscle pains, headaches, fever, discomfort and cold warfare, followed by late symptoms such as respiratory difficulties, coughing and respiratory distress.
The reduction of lymphoma cells, liver function detection anomalies and myo acid hormone increases are common laboratory tests in SARS.
In addition, the increase in upper skin cell growth and mega-corrosion cells were observed in SARS patients.
Then about 20-30% of patients needed intensive care and mechanical air.
Among these severe patients, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs, including gastrointestinal tracts, liver and kidneys, may also be infected and usually accompanied by cell factors storms, which may be fatal among patients with low immune function.
The virus was first separated from an open lung test of a relative of a patient from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, people have been working on HCOV research.
HCOV-NL63 was separated from a seven-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus was initially found to be popular among young children, older persons and immuno-damaged patients with respiratory diseases.
In the diseases caused by HCOV-NL63, there are common noseitis, membraneitis, heat and fine bronchitis.
Another independent study shows that the same virus was separated from the nose cavity of an eight-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although the virus was discovered in the Netherlands, it was actually distributed globally.
It is estimated that HCOV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7 per cent of common respiratory diseases, with a peak of disease in early summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is related to blocked larynitis (also known as Grub throatitis).
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man, who was hospitalized in Hong Kong for pneumonia and fine bronchitis.
In addition to community access to pneumonia and fine bronchitis, there are reports of HCOV-HKU1 related to acute asthma attacks.
Similar to HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 has been discovered worldwide and can cause light respiratory diseases.
All four communities have access to HCOVs well adapted to humans and are often unlikely to mutation and cause high-prevalence diseases. But there are also accidents and for unknown reasons, such as a more toxic rare subtype of HCOV-NL63, which have recently reported serious lower respiratory infections in China.
Usually, when these HCOVs acquire the ability to spread and survive effectively in humans, their toxicity or disease is reduced.
MERS-CoV was first separated from the lungs of a 60-year-old acute pneumonia and kidney failure patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases came from the Middle East, input cases were reported in European countries and Tunisia, with occasional subsequent transmissions to close contacts.
In 2015, the subsequent transmission broke out again in Korea, with 186 confirmed cases.
MERS clinical performance is similar to SARS, characterized by gradual acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also experienced acute kidney failure, a unique feature of MERS in the disease caused by HCOV so far.
Over 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, over 2,500 cases were reported in laboratories, with a death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to mankind.
In mid-December 2019, concentrated pneumonia patients were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and a review analysis confirmed to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization announced that the continuing outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 was an international public health emergency and named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been diagnosed globally, with a rough death rate of 3.4%.
It is worth noting that the death rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2 per cent, while the rate of death outside Hubei is 1.2 per cent.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory infections, as shown as heat, coughing and breathing difficulties.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms, which can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although 82% of the high nucleic acid sequence is very similar, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar, they are concentrated into different branches in system development trees.
SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but more contagious.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to have been infected with symptoms, which may accelerate the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
Compare SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCOVs, and we can find very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the insulation period and duration of the HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the overall trend of six other HCOVs.
Second, COVID-19 symptoms are between SARS-CoV and 4 communities (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are more common in community access to HCOV infections, including non-specific, light or even symptoms.
On the other hand, a small number of cases of COVID-19 are also found in SARS-CoV infections, although the proportion is slightly low.
Third, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting model features of community access HCOV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as community access HCOV.
On the other hand, whether SARS-CoV-2 will decline after human transmission, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCOVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in excreta samples.
At least in some cases, whether SARS-CoV-2's septic-mouth transmission plays an important role as in SARS-CoV and still needs clarification from future studies.
Also, it is important to observe whether SARS-CoV-2 is as seasonal as community-accessed HCOV.
However, the transmission, disease and continuous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will have a significant impact on the final fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All four communities with minor symptoms, HCoV, have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, humans have adapted to these four types of HCOV.
In other words, both sides could be the ancient HCoV popular survivors.
HCOV and people suffering from severe human diseases have died.
To that end, HCoV must make enough reproduction among humans to accumulate adaptive mutations, thereby countering host constraints.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts, the more likely it is to adapt fully to humans.
If it's well adapted, it will be difficult to spread in humans through isolation or other infection control.
Over the years, these four communities have acquired coronary viruses spread among the population, leading to common colds for people with normal immune functions.
These viruses don't need animal hosts.
By contrast, high-prevalence SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted to humans and cannot continue to spread in humans.
They need to survive and reproduce among the host of the common disease of human beings and animals, and they may find opportunities to spread vulnerable human targets through one or more middle hosts and expand their host.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and 4 communities.
It's as contagious as the community's access to HCOV, at least for now.
But it's more sick than the community's access to HCOV, which is lower than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether it is fully adapted to humans and is transmitted within humans without host or intermediate animal host, remains to be seen.
Before discussing the origin of HCoV animals, discuss the evolutionary host of HCOV, the natural host, the storage host, the middle host and the expansion of the definition and characteristics of the host, which has some guidance to us.
If an animal has a closely related ancestors at the level of the nucleic acid sequence, the animal will be the evolutionary host of HCOV.
The ancient virus is usually highly adapted and non-infective in this host.
Likewise, the storage host will carry HCOV for a long time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCOV or its own virus.
By contrast, if HCOV was just born in the middle host or immediately born in the body, it would not be able to adapt well to the Shinjuku and is usually sick.
This middle host can serve as a source of common disease for human infections and animals, and then spread it to humans to expand the host by allowing a short copy of the virus and then spread it to humans to expand the size of human infections.
If HCOV cannot maintain its transmission within the middle host, there may be terminal infections.
Instead, HCoV can adapt to the middle host, even to create long-term locality.
In this case, the host became a natural storage host.
Epidemiological data review analysis found that SARS index cases had history of contact with hunting animals.
The subsequent sero-positive survey showed that the level of immunoglobin G (IgG) in animal dealers against SARS-CoV is higher than the general population.
In the living animal market, the beaver and a beaver cat were first found carrying the SARS-CoV virus almost identical to the SARS-CoV virus.
After removing all fruit beavers in the market, there was no further SARS report, which indirectly supported the view.
However, the report states that farm fruit beavers in wild or uncontact to live animal markets are largely negative about SARS-CoV, which suggests that the fruit beaver may be just a middle magnification host, not a natural host of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that because 80% of different animals on the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, it is not possible to exclude a variety of small mammals or as a possibility of expanding hosts between SARS-CoV.
All these animals seem to be the terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent study of SARS-CoV natural animal host found a closely related bat coronary virus called SARS associated with SARS, HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which survived the Chinese daisies.
These bats are positive about the genome sequence of SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
The virus and other bat coronary viruses and SARS-CoV have 88-92% of the same source of nucleic acid sequences.
These studies laid the foundation for the new concept of bats being the host of the emerging human pathogen.
In addition, researchers have identified a variety of SARS coronary viruses (SL-CoV) from bats, but no virus can be separated as a living virus except for a specified WIV1.
Human blood vessels 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of the known SARS-CoV.
The experiment proved that the WIV1 extracted from bat excreta samples uses bats, fruit beavers and people ACE2 as their receptor to enter the cell.
Interestingly, SARS recovery patients' serum can be medium with WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the closest ancestors to bat SARS-CoV, with 95% of the same nucleic acid sequence.
Although the two viruses are at the same height, it is usually considered that WIV1 is not a direct pro-generation virus of SARS-CoV, nor is the direct storage host of SARS-CoV.
System development analysis classified MERS-CoV as bats CoV-HKU4 and bats CoV-HKU5 as the same group.
Bats CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor diazine 4 (DPP4) to invade the virus.
The RNA dependency RNA polymer enzyme sequence of MERS-CoV is more closely developed in system to the RNA from the bat beta-CoV from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% of the nucleic acid sequence.
So bats may not be the direct storage host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-peak camels are positive towards the seros of MERS-CoV specifics and antibodies, just like camels from several African countries that originated in the Middle East.
MERS-CoV, separated from the nose of a single-peak camel, is the same as the virus found by the human body, which further shows that camels are the real host of MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that in the camels of experimental infection MERS-CoV, the general symptoms are slight, but a large number of viruses are observed.
It is worth noting that infected camels are transmitted not only through respiratory tracts, but also through dung, but also through the faggots, but also the main way to spread the virus by bats.
However, the problem remains, as many MERS confirmed cases do not have a history of contact with camels before symptoms occur, which may be attributed to human or unknown means of transmission, including unrecognized animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 and bats separated from the middle daisies CoV RaTTG13 have 96.2% of the same source of nucleic acid.
As in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RTTG13 is too different to determine pro-generational relationships.
In other words, unless almost the same bat coronary virus is found in the future, bats may not be the direct host of SARS-CoV-2.
It is assumed that the middle animal host of SARS-CoV-2 should sell and kill wildlife species in the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, and many of the initial COVID-19 cases are related, indicating that there may be an animal-to-human transmission.
Recent studies based on the sequence of the macro genome have shown that a endangered small mammals called mountain armor may also carry the ancestors of SARS-CoV-2 associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These new mountain-peech coronary virus genomes and SARS-CoV-2 have 85-92% of the nucleic acid sequence.
But they're as close as RTTG13, and they're about 90% of the same source at the nucleic acid sequence level.
In system development trees, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2 virus subsystems, one of which has a more similar receptor combination (RBD) to SARS-CoV-2 and 97.4% of amino acid sequence congeners.
In contrast, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RTTG13 is much more different, although the entire genome is more active.
An earlier study on disease through mountain armor also reported the infection of viruses detected from lung samples, and the results were similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study, which uses different assembly methods and manual treatment, has obtained some of the genome sequences of about 86.3% of the virus's entire genome.
We can't rule out the possibility of a mountain armor being one of the middle animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, as SARS-CoV-2 varies from the beta-CoV sequence associated with mountain armor SARS-CoV-2, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is directly derived from mountain armor.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RTTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 associated with the mountain armor SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 evolution paths in bats, mountain armor and other mammals remain to be determined.
Although the highest sequence homogenity was found in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and mountain-peated armor, SARS-CoV-2 associated beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RTTG13 have the highest full genome sequence homogenity.
It is highly assumed that the high similarities between beta-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 associated with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 are caused by the evolution of selective media.
Another opposite is that the beta-CoV associated with mountain armor SARS-CoV-2 and RTTG13 are reorganized in the third wildlife species.
As a driver of evolution, reorganization is widespread in beta-CoV.
There is no conclusion about the origin of direct human and animal disease in SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to high-prevalence HCOV, researchers have studied the origin of human and livestock of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1.
System development evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCOV-229E may all originated in bat coronary viruses, while HPOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 pro-generation viruses have been found in rodents.
The report states that the bat coronary virus found in the three-colour bats in North America, called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV), shows that it is closely related to HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E has a genetic connection to another bat coronary virus found in Ghana (known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008), while camel animals are suspected of being host.
For the sake of clarity, figures 1 and 2 summarize existing knowledge of the origin of animals known to be HCoV.
System development analysis provides evidence of the historical inter-dispersion of HCOV.
Around 1890, when HCOV-OC43 infected humans from livestock across species, there was a prevalence of respiratory infectious diseases.
The history of the spread of HCOV-229E is not clear.
Bat alpha-CoV, closely related to HCoV-229E, has been discovered.
There's a camel between them.
There's a lot of evidence that the virus spreads directly from bats to humans.
First, humans, not camels, may be exposed to bats in common ecological positions.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with the camels.
Second, bat alpha-CoV associated with HCOV-229E is diverse and non-infective in bats, while the camel alpha-CoV causes respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, no camels were found in wildlife.
Therefore, the possibility of a camel getting HCOV-229E associated alpha-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human disease-induced viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Nippa and Hendra virus.
So it's not surprising that bats spread HCOV-229E directly to humans.
Or, although bat alpha-CoV acts as a gene bank for HCOV-229E, the camels and single-peak camels may be the middle host that spread the virus to humans, which is exactly the same as the MERS-CoV situation.
MERS-CoV is a good example of the spread from bats to single-peak camels and from single-peak camels to humans.
The evolution of the bat's MERS-CoV was known in its original identification, and the subsequent discovery reinforced this argument.
Apparently, bats provide a rich pool of viruses for the exchange and inter-species of genetic clips.
Long-lived and dense groups, close social interaction and strong flight capabilities are favourable conditions for bats to become ideal "virus spreaders".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in a single camel for decades.
It adapts well to these camels, and camels have moved from the middle host to a stable natural storage host.
MERS-CoV causes very minor diseases in these animals and maintains relatively low mutation rates.
It was an accident to spread between humans, and because it could not continue to spread, humans remain the terminal host of MERS-CoV.
The role of mountain armor in SARS-CoV transmission (if any) is different compared to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV.
Especially, mountain armor, beta-CoV, is highly sick in mountain armor.
They may be the terminal hosts of the beta-CoV associated SARS-CoV-2, similar to the fruit beavers in SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans must be determined or excluded in future studies.
First, bats may be the host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share ecological places with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, the mountain armor could be one of the middle of the extension of the new invasion of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Humans are infected by killing and eating wild smell.
Many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
There's a need for an antibodies investigation of livestock and wildlife.
Third, as noted above, SARS-CoV-2 may be reorganized and adapted in the third species in contact with bats and mountain armor.
Research on the origin of the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus also play an important role in promoting the cross-cutting barriers of coronary viruses.
First, they have a high mutation rate in RNA copying.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the mutation rate of coronary viruses is estimated to be "medium" to "high", and the average replacement rate per year is about 10-4 times per year, depending on the adaptation phase of coronary virus to Shinjuku.
The coronary virus has a proof-reading active nucleo acid extra-cut enzyme, which can lead to a very high degree of variable and decay, and cannot even survive.
Interestingly, Remdesivir, known to be a nucleivir, can inhibit the reproduction of coronary viruses by inhibiting this nucleo acid extra-cut enzyme and RNA dependency RNA polymerase.
Redswell is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the coronary virus has a mutation rate of about 1 million times higher than its host.
Besides, if the coronary virus is not well adapted to the host, the mutation rate is usually high.
SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower than SARS-CoV with high mutation rates, indicating that it is more adaptive to humans.
It's assumed that it's adapted to another host near humanity.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-peak camels.
In theory, genetic drifting may quickly fail vaccines and antivirus drugs against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the larger RNA genome in the coronary virus has additional plasticity in genetic mutation and reorganization, thereby adding the possibility of synergetic evolution, which is conducive to the emergence of new coronary viruses when conditions are appropriate.
This is evidence of a large number of unique open reading boxes and protein functions that are coded to the genome 3' end.
Third, the coronary virus switch templates randomly and frequently through a unique "replicate selection" mechanism during RNA reproduction.
In the host of the hybrid container, the chain exchange is frequent during the transfer of CoV RNA.
The full length and subgenomic RNA of the high congener can reorganize the generation of new coronary viruses.
System development evidence of natural reorganization was found in animal coronary viruses such as HPOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43 and bats SL-CoV and Bats CoV-HKU9.
Interaction with the virus associated with transmission - host
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the interaction between the virus and the host receptor is another key factor affecting the spread between species.
This paper is a typical example of SARS-CoV reorganization, showing evidence of positive choice in inter-dispersion events.
Based on a comparative analysis of the separation of human and fruit beaver SARS-CoV, researchers believe that SARS-CoV can quickly adapt to different hosts, especially through the mutation of S protein RBD.
Usually, RBD in coronary virus S protein interacts with cell receptor and is closely screened by host antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in 318 to 510 amino acids in S1 clips, which is combined with human ACE2 and its coreceptors to bring the virus into.
SARS-CoV's RBD can identify ACE2 receptors of animals, including bats, fruit beavers, rats and beaver cats, thus spreading the virus between species.
In fact, only six amino acid residuals were observed in RBD, four of which were in the sequence of the receptor that interacted with the ACE2 receptor.
There are K479N and S487T mutations in the RBD of SARS-CoV, which may increase the relative strength of the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be essential for the virus to adapt to humans.
It's worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 units is 30%, which means that its combination of S protein and human ACE2 may change.
Indeed, a frozen mirror study shows that this combination is 10 to 20 times higher than the relative strength of the human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It would also be meaningful to determine whether any other coreceptor is required in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCOV-NL63 is also combined with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
In addition, there are many other HCOV receptors, such as the amino enzyme N of HCOV-229E and 9-O-Acetyl acid of HCOV-OC43.
They may also explain why the coronary virus was successfully adapted to humans after spreading from the animal host.
In addition to cell receptor, the results of HCoV transmission are influenced by other host dependence and restrictive factors.
The difference between these host proteins may constitute an obstacle to transmission between humans and bats, single-peak camels and rodents.
HCOV must be deprived of host dependence and break host constraints to successfully spread between them.
In this regard, molecular determining factors in this important area of the virus-host interaction remain to be determined and demonstrated.
An impartial whole genome screening of SARS-CoV-2 hosts using the latest CRISP technology may achieve results.
New HCoV appearance: Back to original
The diversity of bat coronary viruses offers sufficient opportunities for the emergence of new HCOVs.
In that sense, the bat coronary virus acts as a gene bank for HCOV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic reorganization are drivers of the evolution of HCOV and two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coded genes may completely change the shape of the virus.
In SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, because SARS-CoV associated bat viruses were separated, but found that they could encode different ORF8 proteins, and therefore considered ORF8 important to adapt to humans.
At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 missing features of SARS-CoV were found in separate viruses.
This missing divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptation mutation that promotes host conversion.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have been reorganized with alpha- and gamma-CoV spectrums, where a large number of smaller reorganization areas were found in RNA dependency RNA polymer enzymes.
In nsp9, most nsp10 and part of nsp14 also found the reorganization position.
Similarly, studies have shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced a reorganization between different spectrum systems, which occurred in Saudi Arabia's single-peak camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, reorganizations were observed in other HCOVs, where HCOV and other animal coronary viruses were reorganized in their non-structured genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may lead to unexpected changes in the virus genome, which is likely to be due to reducing the choice pressure imposed by the virus, such as the host immune system.
One example of these effects is that in the HCoV-229E prototype virus plant, the lack of dual nucleic acid has led to a total loss of ORF4.
Although complete ORF4 can be observed in bats and camel viruses associated with HCOV-229E, the camel alpha-CoV shows individual nucleic acid insertions, causing a mutation of the transfer code.
Last but equally important, the evolution of the new HCOV is driven by the pressure of the storage host's choice.
After bats were infected with coronary virus, no symptoms or only minor symptoms were detected, indicating that the coronary virus and bats were adapted.
From the point of view of anatomy and physiology, bats seem to be well adapted to the coronary virus.
For example, the defects in the activation of bats for inflammation have effectively reduced the pathology caused by the coronary virus.
In addition, the natural killing cell activity of bats is inhibited because of the positive regulation of NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the main tissue compatibility complex I molecules.
Moreover, the high-level active oxygen (ROS) from high metabolic activity of bats can inhibit the reproduction of coronary viruses and can be used to influence proofreading through nuclear sugar nucleic acid, thus providing a choice pressure for the virus plant when entering Shinjuku.
More sick coronary viruses can also evolve by reorganizing, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics to fit the host.
So, three new HCOVs have emerged over the last two decades.
The coronary virus does not cause illness or minor symptoms in storage hosts such as bats and camels.
They make a lot of reproduction and do not cause a strong host immune response.
That's why there are no symptoms and serious cases of human infection.
Serious symptoms are mainly due to excessive activation of immune reactions and cell factor storms, the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
By contrast, among the non-symmetric carriers, the immune reaction has been decoded from the coronary virus.
The same strategy to delink the immune reaction may have an active role in combating SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
The interference reaction in bats is particularly strong.
Therefore, the use of I-type interference at least in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection should be useful.
Besides, the NLRP3 inflammation activation in bats is flawed.
Based on this reasoning, using MCC950 to inhibit NLRP3 inflammation may be useful for COVID-19 treatment.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme based on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV generation.
Although 95% of bats with SARS-CoV have been found with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronary virus with SARS-CoV-2 as high as 96%.
Although fruit beavers and other animals in the market have been found to carry the same virus as SARS-CoV, the direct middle host of SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
It is now discovered that the mountain armor beta-CoV, which is clearly the same source as SARS-CoV-2, indicates that the armor may be one of the middle hosts, or that the mountain armor beta-CoV may contribute to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or unintentional.
As a result of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the coronary virus has re-emerged the focus of attention.
Research on coronary viruses in bats and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of the origin of the HCoV human and animal disease and the importance of animal hosts in human transmission.
There is a lot of evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and transmitted to humans through middle hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infections are derived from contact between humans and fruit beavers on the market, closing the wet market and killing fruit beavers can effectively end the SARS epidemic.
Similarly, given the discovery of multiple spectrometry of mountain armor beta-CoV, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, mountain armor should be removed from the wet cargo market to prevent the spread of human and livestock.
But whether SARS-CoV-2 and how to spread to humans through mountain armor and other mammals still needs to be further studied.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in existence for a long time in a single-peak camel.
These camels are important means of transport and the main source of local meat, milk, leather and furline products.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to model the Chinese wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and sacrifice all camels to control MERS.
To stop the re-emergence of MERS, integrated initiatives should be taken in conjunction with other infection control measures to develop effective anti-MERS-CoV vaccines for camels.
Because we can't eliminate these viruses, new genetics may appear and cause an outbreak.
The coronary virus of all kinds of human and animals is flowing in the wild environment.
In particular, bat coronary viruses with the potential for human and animal co-disease are very diverse.
These people have many opportunities for evolution and reorganization of coronary viruses, which lead to the future more likely to spread and/or deadly new coronary viruses in humans.
In some parts of China, the culture of eating wildlife should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
After the severe test of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we should develop better prevention and response plans.
In fact, many viruses have been on Earth for a long time.
They stay among their natural hosts until there is a spill.
Although bats have many characteristics that are good for virus transmission, if people are educated and far from bats and other wild species, human access to bats and other wild species will be significantly reduced.
In order to better understand the ecological conditions of coronary viruses and its natural host, there is a need for continuous monitoring of mammals, which will prove that this is very useful to prevent the spread of animals to humans and future eruptions.
In short, the most effective way to prevent the disease of viral animals is that humans should stay away from the ecological level of natural host of the virus.
There are still a few missing puzzles of the origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats spread an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus to a mountain armor, it's meaningful to look at what circumstances bats and mountain armor can share the same ecological position.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, then how humans are exposed to bats is still to be determined.
Third, if the third mammals act as a real middle host, it must be clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and mountain armor.
Finally, as many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection studies should be conducted.
If it's bats, mountain armor or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 will be found in the natural host or almost the same pro-generation virus.
Continued research in this field will reveal the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which is important for human COVID-19 prevention and control.
There is a need to update the diagnostic standards for COVID-19 "Suspicious Cases" and "diagnosed cases"
On February 6, 2020, our team released a fast-track advice guide for diagnosis and treatment of new coronary viruses (2019-nCoV), through which we have provided experience and lessons on global response to the epidemic.
However, 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease based on ongoing research and clinical practice experience, our awareness of the disease is gradually increasing; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to an opinion on the above-mentioned guidelines and provided the latest "COVID-19 diagnostic programme" issued by the National Health Council of the People's Republic of China (seventh edition), providing the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "diagnosed cases".
In December 2019, the new coronary virus (2019-nCoV) broke out and now the disease has been officially named 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19), which was named a severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronary virus (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO (WHO) listed COVID-19 as a global epidemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation guide and posted it online on February 06, 2020 to the magazine Military Medical Research.
Since its launch, it has attracted widespread attention.
But please note that COVID-19 is a new disease based on ongoing research and clinical practice experience, and our awareness of the disease is gradually increasing; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Commission of the People ' s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) released seven editions of the COVID-19 Clinical Program between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have changed substantially.
Now, our guide has received comments from Zhou and others, who have proposed a simple rating based on their clinical experience.
Their work provides new evidence for our guide and provides valuable references to the global epidemic.
We recognize and thank them for this important work.
However, their proposals also need to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Clinical Program (pilot 7th edition) and recent research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), suspected cases do require a combination of an epidemiological history feature with two clinical manifestations to conduct a comprehensive analysis, and three clinical manifestations need to be met if there is no clear history of epidemiology:
Epidemiological history: (1) Travel or residence history of exposure to communities with COVID-19 cases, 14 days before symptoms occur; (2) contact with SARS-CoV-2 cases of infection (positive acid detection); (3) contact with patients from Wuhan City and surrounding areas or other reported COVID-19 within 14 days of the symptoms; (4) contact with 2 cases of heat or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan City and around them 14 days before the symptoms occur; (4) 2 cases of exposure to concentrated confirmed cases (at less than 2 weeks before symptoms occur, 2 cases of heat and/or respiratory symptoms, such as home, offices, school classes, etc.).
Clinical performance: (1) heat and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) image characteristics with COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white cells in the early stages of the disease is normal or reduced and the number of lymphoma cells is reduced.
Diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases and any of the following pathology or serology evidence: (1) real-time PCR detection positive in SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full genome sequence of the virus shows the high source of the known new coronary virus; (3) the specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies in the serum test for SARS-CoV-2 are positive; or SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies are positive from negative to positive, or four times higher than acute periods.
As we can see, the second editions (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020) add real-time PCR nucleic acid tests in respiratory or blood samples.
The fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020) added blood specimen pathology tests; the seventh edition added serum evidence.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to study the best nucleic acid test reagent boxes for rapid diagnosis and respiratory samples, including blood mining, which increases the availability of different samples and provides evidence to include positive results of specific antibodies into the diagnostic criteria.
Besides, there's more and more evidence that reminds us of atypical symptoms and non-symmetrical patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated because they classified persons without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
In addition, the rating system needs to be validated in further clinical practice and research.
Finally, we want more direct evidence and call on readers to comment.
For diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "diagnosed cases", we suggest reference and follow the latest guidelines in the country where the case is located.
Our team will update our guidelines in time to help.
Bangladesh reported five new COVID-19 deaths, one day high
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths that day.
This has created a new number of single-day deaths from the virus.
As of yesterday, 114 confirmed cases of infection reported by the Bangladesh Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research Institute (IEDCR) and 33 cases were cured after home rest.
17 cumulative deaths.
At the online press conference, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, head of IEDCR, stated that these deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, there are two cases over 60 years of age, two between 51 and 60 years of age, and one between 41 and 50 years.
She also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a global epidemic on March 11.
A hospital officer revealed to the local media, Anadolu Agency, one of the deaths, Jalal Saifur Rahman, Director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, the Bangladesh Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, announced by online video that public transport would be suspended beyond the original plan and extended until Saturday.
The public transport was suspended on March 26th and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Basic materials such as medical, fuel and food are still properly transported.
On 8 March, two of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 recorded in Bangladesh returned from Italy and one of the patients was the wife of one of the confirmed patients.
By March 19, all three patients had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than a million infections worldwide
According to John Hopkins University, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronary virus infection worldwide has exceeded 1 million on Thursday.
At least 52,000 deaths are associated with the coronary virus - COVID-19.
On the same day of the milestone, Malawi confirmed the first coronary virus infection in the country, with the first deaths associated with coronary virus in Zambia.
North Korea claims that by Thursday, it was one of the few countries without coronary virus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization had reported 1051635 confirmed cases, including 79332 within 24 hours of 10 a.m. in central European time (0800 UTC).
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronary virus cases have been recorded, killing at least 5,900 people.
CBS News quoted data from John Hopkins University that on Wednesday, coronary virus infections killed more than 1,000 people in the United States.
Worldwide, countries have announced stricter measures to suppress the spread of disease.
Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, extended the date of closure until May 1.
President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians would continue to be paid during the suspension of work throughout the country until April 30th.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; it was adopted by 215 votes to 10 abstentions and 1 objection.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in Al-Quds Al-Qudner and Medina to a full-day curfew; before that curfew was effective between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its home order until May 1.
Australian stores have reduced the maximum number of toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday night, the Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles reduced the maximum of each trading toilet paper purchase of all their stores to two and one pack, respectively.
ALDI also introduced a limited purchase limit on Monday.
These restrictions are posted on the register or posted on the Facebook page of the chain.
Reports say that buyers hoarded goods for fear of COVID-19 in case they need to be isolated.
Wednesday, Woolworth also limited the amount of toilet paper to each single package.
Before these changes, Woolworths and Coles introduced four packages per transaction on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles reported in his press release on March 8, after the four-pack restrictions were implemented, "Many shops were still sold out within an hour of arrival" and called demand "unprecedented", while ALDI called it "unexpected" in Tuesday's Facebook post.
According to a Woolworth spokesman, last week's sales increased dramatically.
Last week, Costco in Canberra also limited the allowed number to two packs.
To further mitigate the shortage, Coles ordered a larger packaging to the supplier and increased the frequency of delivery, and Woolworth ordered additional stocks, while ALDI prepared the planned Wednesday ex gratia.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retail Association, said that retailers were trying to increase their stocks, but the restrictions on truck delivery time made it difficult for local councils.
He expects that as suppliers try to meet demand, production costs will rise, while preferential activities will decrease.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after early release of the inventory, some stores would not be able to hold Wednesday special events.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said that the store would supplement stocks every night.
He said that toilet paper was a large item, so there was a small stock and, once sold out, it would leave a huge shelf space, which increases the feeling of a shortage of supplies.
"Coles and Woolworths' point is that if there are many things on the shelf, goods like roller paper and handwash can [buy] and are sufficient, you may not be so scared. " Russell Zimmerman said to ABC News.
The regenerative toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap last Wednesday said they had no stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures slurry toilet paper, and Solaris Paper Paper, who made Sorbent toilet paper, stressed that they were working all day, on weekends to ensure supply.
The real estate website Domain.com reported that some real estate agents would provide free toilet paper to the first bidder at the auction in Melbourne because of the lower number of auctions held by buyers on the weekend of the Labor Day.
NT News is a daily newspaper printed in Darwin City, which contains eight pages of plugs in its Thursday edition, designed to be used as toilet paper after cutting.
According to ABC Australia, on March 3, the store was initially reluctant to impose restrictions on purchases, and they said they had no plans to impose purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other commodities were also in high demand, including masks, handwashing fluids, dry goods, handwashing fluids and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to 2 packs of 12 volumes per package on Sunday night.
World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 (diseases caused by the coronary virus SARS-CoV-2) was a pandemic.
Although the term "pop" refers only to the extent of the spread of disease, not the level of risk of specific cases, WHO notes the need to urge the Government to take measures:
"All countries/areas can still change the process of this popular ...
If countries/areas test, test, treatment, isolation, tracking and mobilization as a response, as the Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says.
"We are deeply concerned about the alarming extent of proliferation and gravity and the alarming extent of inaction ... "
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, this epidemic is "unprecedented".
He commented at CNN in February, "No respiratory virus has been found to continue to spread globally after the emergence of the flu."
Ghebreyesus expressed similar views and said, "We've never seen a coronary virus-induced epidemic before."
He went on to say, "Same, we've never seen a controlled virus epidemic before."
Before entering the new state of the epidemic, WHO identified this outbreak as an international public health event in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases of the United States, said that the outbreak was "most importantly, it is still deteriorating."
By Thursday, Associated Press reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
2019-2020 The coronary virus epidemic is a continuous spread of new coronary virus diseases (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was confirmed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and was identified as an epidemic on January 30, 2020 as an international public health emergency.
As of 10 April 2020, 210 countries and territories worldwide reported cumulatively reported approximately 161 million COVID-19 cases, with deaths of about 97,000 people,
The cure is about 36.4 million people.
China has a death rate of about 4 per cent, compared to 0.08% (New Zealand) and 13.04 per cent (Algeria).
Common symptoms include heat, cough and air.
And it could be accompanied by complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The insulation period from exposure to the disease varies from 2-14 days, usually around five days.
There are no vaccine or special effects antivirus treatment.
Clinical treatment is based on treatment for disease support. The recommended precautions include handwashing, coughing, keeping safe distance from others, monitoring and self-separation of suspected infected persons.
Official agencies have taken response measures such as travel restrictions, isolation, curfew, workplace hazard control and closure of facilities.
The epidemic has caused a serious impact on the global socio-economic impact, with sports, religion, political and cultural activities postponed or cancelled, while panic shopping has exacerbated a wide supply shortage.
Global 193 countries and territories introduced national or local suspension measures, with approximately 99.4 per cent of primary and secondary school students affected.
As false virus information is transmitted online, there are incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other East and South-East Asian groups of origin and appearances and groups in areas with severe epidemics.
However, reduced travel and heavy industrial closures have reduced air pollution indices and reduced carbon emissions.
On December 31, 2019, the health department of Wuhan, China, informed a group of unknown cases of pneumonia and launched an investigation in early January 2020.
Most of these cases are related to the wholesale market for seafood in China, so the new coronary virus is considered a common disease for human and livestock.
The virus that triggered this outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that is closely linked to the bat coronary virus, the mountain armor coronary virus and SARS-CoV. The first patient was confirmed to have a disease on 1 December 2019 and was not clearly linked to the following cases of the Chinese seafood market.
Two thirds of the early cases reported in December 2019 were confirmed to be related to the South China Seafood Market.
On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning Post published an unproven report stating that the first case could date back to November 17, 2019, with a patient of 55 years old, from Hubei Province. On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported a decline in new cases in China, but new reported cases in Italy, Iran and Korea suddenly increased significantly, and that the number of new cases outside China exceeded the country for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially light cases.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases of adolescents were reported, with only 2.4 per cent among young people aged 19 and under. Patrick Valance, the British chief scientific adviser, estimated that about 60 per cent of the population was infected with a new coronary virus to obtain effective group immunization.
The number of cases is the number of people who have been tested by COVID-19 and confirmed positive according to official programmes.
As of March 23, the proportion of groups tested in the world was not more than 3 per cent of the total population, and many countries had issued official policies for people who do not detect light diseases, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 states that as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infected people in China had not been tested, while these unrecorded infections were 79% of the infected sources of recorded cases.
According to a statistical analysis published on March 30, the number of actual infections in Italy is much higher than the number of reported cases.
The basic number of infections (R0) for COVID-19 was originally estimated to range from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the American Center for Disease Control shows that R0 could be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients can recover.
Unrecoverable patients are 6-41 days from disease to death, 14 days most common.
As of April 10, 2020, about 97,000 people had died of COVID-19.
As of February 5, about 80% of deaths in China were over 60 years of age, 75% of deaths were accompanied by basic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official statistics on COVID-19 deaths usually refer to positive deaths according to official programmes.
Actual COVID-19 deaths may be far beyond statistics, as the data may not contain patients who have not been tested, such as those who die in homes, sanatoriums, etc.
Some data from Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the epidemic is 4-5 times the number of deaths of new coronary virus pneumonia in official statistics.
A female spokesman at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) said, "We know that [published deaths] are below actual values," and the rumours about the undervalued data in the United States confirmed this statement. Underestimating the epidemic, such as the 2009 H1N1 Pig flu outbreak. On January 9, 2020, the first confirmed death in China occurred in Wuhan.
On February 1, the first deaths outside China occurred in the Philippines, and on February 14, the first deaths outside Asia occurred in France.
As of February 28, more than 10 deaths had occurred outside China, Iran, Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and territories except Antarctica reported deaths. There were several ways to quantify mortality.
These figures vary over time, depending on the region, and are affected by the characteristics of population characteristics such as the test, the quality of the health system, the treatment programme, the first outbreak of the outbreak and age, gender and overall health status.
According to John Hopkins University statistics, as of 10 April 2020, the global mortality rate was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The rate of death and death varies from region to region.
In China, the estimated death rate fell from 17.3 per cent (patients who had suffered from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (patients who have suffered after 1 February 2020). Other measures include case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR), which reflects the percentage of confirmed deaths of diseases, which reflect the percentage of confirmed deaths, which reflect the percentage of the number of deaths of disease deaths (including confirmed and undiagnod).
These statistics have no time limit and track the whole process of a particular population from infection to case resolution.
Many scholars try to calculate the data for specific groups.
According to Oxford University's Evidence-based Medicine Center, the overall infection mortality rate for the epidemic ranges from 0.1 to 0.39%.
The maximum estimate of this range is consistent with the first random test conducted by Germany on COVID-19 and a statistical analysis study on the impact of the CFR estimate.
The World Health Organization claims that the outbreak is manageable.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak cannot be determined and vary from region to region.
Maciej Boni from Pennsylvania State University says, "If it is not controlled, the outbreak of infectious diseases usually enters a stagnant period after the existing host is exhausted and then starts to mitigate.
But it is almost impossible for us to predict when the turning point will appear at this time. "
Zhong Namshan, Senior Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, believes that if all countries mobilize, adopt the World Health Organization proposal to take measures to stop the spread of the virus, then "the end of the outbreak in June is expected".
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine, stated that SARS-CoV-2 " could explode repeatedly and last for one to two years. "
Neil Ferguson, led by Imperial Institute of Technology, research shows that "before the vaccine is operational (which may require 18 months or more)" must be taken to maintain physical distance and other measures.
William Schaffner from Van derburg University said, "This coronary virus is very contagious, and I think it's unlikely to disappear completely," "may turn into a seasonal disease that explodes once a year."
The re-emergence depends on the level of immunity and mutation of the group.
COVID-19 symptoms are relatively non-specific, and some infected persons may not have symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are heat (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Unusual symptoms include fatigue, respiratory slurry (sniff), loss of smell, air promotion, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headaches, coldness, vomiting, blood, diarrhoea or thorium. According to the World Health Organization, about one sixth of patients are severe and have respiratory difficulties.
The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) lists respiratory difficulties, continuous chest pains or stress, sudden confusion, difficulty of soberness and hair on the face or lips as urgent symptoms; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended that medical treatment be brought to immediate treatment. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock and death.
Some infected persons may have no symptoms, no clinical performance, but the results are positive, so researchers suggest close observation and inspection of persons diagnosed with close contact, excluding the possibility of infection.
China estimates that the rate of non-symmetric infections varies from very low to 44%.
Insistence periods (from infection to time interval) are generally 1-14 days; 5 days most common. With regard to uncertainty, the share of patients who lose smell in COVID-19 patients is initially estimated at 30 per cent and then reduced to 15%.
Some details of the path to the disease have not yet been determined.
It is currently believed that the disease is transmitted mainly through close contact and cough, sneeze or talking; close contact means within 1-2 m (3-6 feet).
The study found that the unshield cough could lead to a maximum spread of 4.5 meters (15 feet) - 8.2 metres (15-27 feet).
It was also suggested that the foam that people speak in the air for a longer period may also cause the spread of the virus, although the virus is usually not transmitted through the air, people may also produce foam when they exhale or speak.
This foam could fall into the nose and nose of the people around them, even inhaled into the lungs.
Medical procedures such as intubation and CPR may fog the respiratory soil, thus causing air transmission.
Also, if a person touches the surface (including skin) contaminated with the virus, then touching his nose and nose, it could also cause the virus to spread.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through excreta, but the risk is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 dung transmission. The virus is the most contagious three days before and after the disease.
Positive results can be detected three days before the disease, which suggests that the new coronary virus is contagious before the obvious symptoms occur.
Although very few cases of non-symmetric cases identified in laboratories have been reported, some countries have detected symptoms of infection during the follow-up of contacts.
The European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) states that while the new coronary virus is not yet fully known, one person generally transmits 2-3 people. The virus survives from hours to days on the surface of the object.
Specifically, the new coronary virus is known to survive on plastics (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, and survive on cardboard for up to four hours on copper.
However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature.
There is no evidence that animals can re-transmit the virus to humans, but the official British agency still recommends that people wash their hands after exposure to animals, just like other surfaces that may be touched by infected people.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first separated from three pneumonia patients with acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the relevant coronary virus of nature. Before the virus enters the body, it can be killed with domestic soap because soap can dissolved the virus's protective cyst. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It's considered a common disease.
Genetic analysis shows that this coronary virus is genetically associated with the beta coronary virus being Sarbecovirus sub-group and two bat-source viruses.
The new coronary virus and other bat coronary virus samples (BatCov RaTTG13) are 96% consistent at the entire genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that only one amino acid is missing from some parts of the human virus in the genome sequence.
As of the current full genome comparison, up to 92% of the genetic material between the coronary virus and SARS-CoV-2 is not sufficient to prove that the armor is the middle host.
Whether the virus is infected with a preliminary diagnosis of symptoms, but ultimately it is only confirmed by the retrospective polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of infected genres.
A PCR compared to CT in Wuhan showed that CT was clearly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, and many imaging features would be combined with other pneumonia and disease development processes.
As of March 2020, the American Society of Radiology recommended that "CT is not suitable for screening COVID-19 or as the first test of the disease."
The World Health Organization has now published several nucleic acid testing programmes for SARS-CoV-2, and the first programme was published on January 17.
Nucleic acid testing uses real-time reverse polymer enzyme chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Respiratory samples or blood samples can be used for detection.
The results are usually available in hours to days.
Generally, this test is done through the nose swab, and it can be done through the swallow. Many laboratories and companies are developing serum tests for antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests proved accurate enough to approve widespread use.
In the United States, serology tests developed by Cellex have been approved for use by certified laboratories only in emergencies.
Typical imaging features of X tablets and computer fault scans of patients include outer-week glass asymmetrics and chestless cavity.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compilation of international online databases on the image performance of confirmed cases.
The specificity of images that have not been confirmed by PCR is limited in identifying COVID-19 because of re-conformity with other viruses (e.g. gland viruses).
A large Chinese study compared the results of the chest CT to the PCR results and found that, although images were less specific to identifying infections, faster and more sensitive tests could therefore be considered as a screening tool for popular areas.
A volume neural network based on artificial intelligence has been developed to jointly use X and CT to detect video features of the virus.
Measures to prevent disease transmission include good hygiene habits, handwashing, avoiding direct touch of the nose, coughing or sneezing with paper towels, and throw them directly into the trash can with a paper towel.
Suspected infected persons should wear medical surgical masks when entering public places.
Measures to maintain physical distance are also recommended to prevent the spread of viruses. Many Governments have limited or recommended avoiding travel to and from countries affected by the epidemic without necessity.
However, the virus is now at the community level in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community, and some community residents are unable to know where or how they are infected. Medical personnel who are exposed to suspected infected persons should take standard precautions to access preventive measures and eye protection.
The government's use of mobile phone positioning data for tracking purposes has raised concerns about privacy, and more than 100 organizations, such as Amnesty International, have issued statements calling for restrictions on such oversight.
There are currently various mobile applications that have been put into use or entry proposals for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on solutions with privacy protection, such as using Bluetooth to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
Once users have close contact with patients with positive results of the COVID-19 test, they receive a reminder that the false statements about the prevention of infection continue to spread; such as washing noses and washing mouths with mouthwashing is invalid.
There are no COVID-19 vaccines, but many organizations are actively developing it.
It's recommended to stop the spread of disease by washing hands.
The Center recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially after dinner and after having visible stains on their hands, before dinner and sneeze.
It's because the virus can destroy the cystal film by using home soap before entering the body.
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) also recommends that at least 60% of alcohol-containing handwashing be used if there is no soap and tap water around it.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, noses or mouths without washing hands.
The surface of the object can be disinfected by multiple solutions (the disinfectant can work within a minute of stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorate, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% polyvetone iodide.
Other solutions (e.g. phenylacamine and chlorohexyl glucose acid) are less effective.
The United States Center for Disease Control recommends that all regions should be disinfected if new cases of coronary virus pneumonia or confirmed cases occur at facilities such as office or day care, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablet computers, touch screens, keyboards, remote control and patient-used ATMs.
WHO recommends that people cover their mouths with bending elbows or paper towels when coughing or sneeze and immediately remove all contaminated tissues.
It is recommended that the suspected infected wear medical surgical masks because wearing masks can reduce the amount of foam out of speech, sneeze and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued a description of the location and use of masks.
Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, said, "The mask reduces the tendency to touch their faces, and the face is a major source of infection in the absence of hand hygiene."
The World Health Organization recommends that healthy people only wear masks in high-risk areas, such as those who care for COVID-19 patients, but the organization also recognizes that wearing masks helps to avoid face touch.
Some countries and territories have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.
The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends wearing non-medical masks made of fabric. China clearly recommends that healthy citizens wear one-time medical masks, especially when they are in close contact with others within (1 m (3 feet).
Hong Kong, China, suggested that masks be required to travel to public transport or to enter densely dense sites.
Thai health officials suggest that people make their own masks and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia are strictly forbidden to wear masks or to enter public places without covering their noses.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks to enter public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has provided that all people enter the grocery store with masks.
Israel demands that all residents need masks in public.
Taiwan, China, has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, and on April 1st, requires the need to wear masks on trains and inter-city buses.
Panama has provided for the need to wear masks and suggest that the residents who cannot buy them homemade masks.
The masks are also widely used in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
The prevention and control measures for maintaining social distance (also known as physical distance) are designed to minimize close contact between people and people, thereby reducing the spread of diseases.
Measures include isolation; travel restrictions; suspension, suspension and closure of stadiums, theatres or shopping centres.
In keeping social distance, measures that individuals can take include staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding access to dense areas, changing non-contact greetings and maintaining physical distance from others.
Now, many governments have forced to request or recommend social distance in areas affected by the epidemic.
With regard to the largest crowd concentration, the original proposal of United States government agencies and WHO was 250 (in areas where COVID-19 was transmitted), followed by a quick reduction to 50, and then to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings for more than two people. Older persons and groups suffering from diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and immune system damage are at higher risk of severe illness and complications. The German Center for Disease Control recommends that such populations living in the area of the epidemic be as far as possible. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health institutions began replacing "social distance" with the term "maintenance of physical distance" to clarify its aim to reduce physical contact while maintaining social contact, including virtual and remote contact.
The term "maintaining social distance" contains the meaning of requiring complete isolation from society, and does not encourage people to maintain connections in other ways. Some authorities have also issued sexual health guidelines applicable during the pandemic.
The recommendations include sexual relations with partners living alone and without infection with viruses or symptoms.
It is recommended that COVID-19 identify patients and suspected infected homes for self-separation.
Health institutions have issued details of the correct self-separation. Many governments have forced or recommended that all residents of the epidemic be self-separated.
The most severe self-separation instructions were issued to the high-risk population.
If it is possible to have access to COVID-19 patients, or in countries or areas that have been widely transmitted recently, it is recommended that self-separation be made 14 days from the end possible time of exposure to the virus.
Epidemic control strategies include containment/repression and mitigation.
Curbing applies to the early stages of the outbreak, with the aim of tracking and isolation of infected persons, while taking other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent disease from spreading to other groups.
If the spread of diseases cannot be contained, efforts must be made to transition to mitigation: measures to mitigate the spread of diseases and reduce the impact of disease on the health system and society.
Curbing and mitigation measures can be carried out simultaneously.
The inhibition requires more extreme control measures to reverse the epidemic by reducing basic regeneratives to less than 1.
This reduces the risk of collapse of the health service system and takes more time for the development of vaccines and treatment programmes.
Non-drug interventions that control the epidemic include individual preventive measures, such as maintaining hand hygiene, masks and self-separation; community measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as suspension and the elimination of large-scale assembly activities; community action aimed at encouraging and participating in such interventions; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning.
Other countries and territories have also taken various measures to limit the spread of viruses.
Korea introduced large-scale screening and local isolation measures and issued alerts on the activity of the infected.
Singapore provides financial support to self-separation infected persons, with significant fines on those who refuse to isolate themselves.
Taiwan, China, has increased its mask production and imposed penalties on the suppliers of medical supplies that cover the sale. Simulations of the United Kingdom and the United States show that mitigation (reducing without stopping the spread of epidemics) and inhibiting (reverse the spread of epidemics) faces major challenges.
Best mitigation policies may reduce peak health demand by 2/3 and halve deaths, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths, causing a breakdown of the health system.
The inhibition may be the preferred measure, but it needs to be maintained to stop spreading among the population (or until the vaccine is launched, on the basis of first arrival), otherwise the spread will rebound quickly once the measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention aimed at inhibiting the epidemic can bring social and economic costs.
No special antivirus drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but research and development is still under way, including testing existing drugs.
Taking non-prescription cold medicine, rehydration and rest may help to alleviate symptoms.
Based on the gravity of the condition, oxygen therapy, veins and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids could cause a deterioration.
Several compounds previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied to determine whether they are applicable to the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also noted that some "traditional and family therapy" could alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization has noted that improving processing capacity and adjusting the medical system to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients is a basic epidemic response.
ECDC and the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospital and primary health care services for the transfer of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating and isolateing COVID-19 positive patients, and improving intensive care through training and increasing the number of breathing machines and beds available.
There are many speculations about the origin of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of coronary virus pneumonia dates back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of new coronary virus cases in Hubei province has increased.
Most of these patients are related to the Chinese seafood wholesale market, which also sells live animals, a theory that the new coronary virus is derived from some animal; or, in other words, it originated in common illness. On 26 December, the doctor at the Central West Medical Union Hospital in Hubei Province first discovered and treated an unknown group of pneumonia patients and reported to the disease prevention control centre in Jianghan District, Wuhan City, on December 27th.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital reminded his colleagues of a "SARS-like coronary virus".
Eight doctors, including Li Wen-Ling, were warned by the police for spreading rumors, and another doctor, Eiffin, was warned by his superiors for calling the alarm.
The Wuhan City Health Council subsequently issued a bulletin on December 31st and reported it to the World Health Organization.
After receiving numerous reports of unknown pneumonia cases, a survey was launched in early January. In the early days of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled about half a half every seven days.
Between January and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China, affected by the movement of the Chinese Spring Festival and Wuhan as a transport hub and major railway hub.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new confirmed cases in one day, including 2 Beijing and 1 Shenzhen.
The subsequent official data show that as of 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had symptoms. As of 26 March, the United States had more confirmed cases than China and Italy, and became the largest country in the world. As of 9 April 2020, the global cumulative report did more than 16.1 million cases; more than 97,000 deaths had been cured, and more than 364,000 cases had been cured.
About 200 countries and territories worldwide reported confirmed cases.
In many countries in the Schengen region, many countries in the Schengen region have taken control measures to limit free movement of populations and establish border controls.
National-level responses include containment, such as isolation (also known as home order, local asylum order or blockade) and curfew. As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, are in some form of blockade, with more than 50 million people in the Philippines under blockade, and South Africa had about 59 million people under blockade, and 1.3 billion people in India were in a state of blockade.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of blockade, and two days later, the figure rose to 2.6 billion, or about one third of the global population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019, in Wuhan; an unverified report assumed that the earliest case dates back to November 17th.
Dr. Zhang found an unknown number of cases of pneumonia on December 26, where the hospital reported this to the disease prevention control centre in Jianghan District, Wuhan City, on December 27th.
On December 27, 2019, a coronary virus similar to SARS was found in a preliminary genetic test of patient samples.
The Wuhan City Health Council issued a bulletin on December 31st.
Reported to the World Health Organization on the same day.
After these notifications, several doctors in Wuhan City were warned by the police for walking rumors.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no clear evidence of the human being.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, and later, the Central Secretary-General of the Communist Party, Xi Jinping, called it a "people war" to contain the spread of viruses.
On January 23rd, the government announced that it had launched a quarantine line in Wuhan, which banned access to Wuhan, which later extended to 15 other cities in Hubei, with a total of about 57 million people affected, "the largest isolation in human history".
Private cars are forbidden in the city.
Many places have also cancelled the celebration of the Chinese New Year's Agricultural Calendar (January 25).
The government also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Fire God Mountain Hospital, which was completed and delivered within 10 days.
Then another hospital, Ray Shinsan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospital, China has transformed 14 other sites in Wuhan, such as the Convention Centre and stadium, into square cabin hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took further measures to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, including the issuance of health declarations to travellers and extended spring holidays.
The national higher education and primary and secondary schools are also completely suspended.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions of China have also taken a number of measures, particularly for primary and secondary schools and higher education.
China has implemented remote home office measures in many places.
Travel restrictions are imposed in addition to Hubei province.
Public transport has been adjusted and museums across China are temporarily closed.
Many cities have introduced public activity facilities, and it is estimated that about 760 million people (over half of the population) are restricted by some form of outdoor activity. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from "inputing" from other countries and territories.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day compulsory isolation of all persons abroad. Within five days before March 23, only one native case occurred in mainland China, which was transmitted by a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of local cases had been largely contained and that the Chinese epidemic had been controlled.
On the same day, the Hubei region, other than Wuhan, began to release travel restrictions two months after the blockade was imposed. On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that, on 28 March 2020, the suspension of the entry of foreigners with valid Chinese visas and residence permits had not disclosed details.
Those who want to enter China are required to apply for visas from the Chinese Embassy or Consulate.

Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the Health Emergency Project of the World Health Organization, warned in a statement: "This is a reality check of governments around the world: wake up.
The virus may be approaching, please be prepared and urged Governments to take the right response to avoid the worst of the world.

For the initial outbreak of the epidemic in Hubei Province, China, Michael Goff, Secretary of the British Cabinet Office, and Eduardo Bosonaro, son of Brazilian President Yail Bosonaro, criticized the Chinese government.
Several Chinese Communist Party (CPC) provincial administrative officials were dismissed from office for mistreatment of the Chinese region, reflecting the central disgruntled response to the epidemic response to local political institutions.
Some commentators believe that this is intended to avoid public dissatisfaction with Xi Jinping, Central Secretary of the Communist Party for the outbreak of a new coronary virus.
Some Chinese officials (e.g. Zhao Lijin) denied the previously recognized COVID-19 outbreak that began in Wuhan and supported conspiracy theories about the new coronary virus pneumonia that originated in the United States or Italy.
US President Donald Trump once called the new coronary virus "China virus" or "Wuhan virus", claiming that China's "review system has exacerbated the spread of the virus and transforms it into a global epidemic", which in turn has been considered a racial discrimination by some critics and "transfers the concern that its government has failed to contain the virus".
The Daily Beast has received a telegram from the United States government, which outlines a communication strategy that is clearly sent by the National Security Council, which says, "All of this is not off the line with China.
We were told in any way, including press conferences and television, and to spread this information as far as possible." "Politicians", "foreign policy" and Bloomberg, media claim that China ' s assistance to the epidemic countries was intended to promote its global influence.
Josep Borrell, the head of EU foreign policy, warned that there was a "geopolitics factor that included competition for influence through good offices and generous politics".
Borrel also said, "China is promoting it, unlike the United States, a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran and allegedly provided assistance to the latter two countries.

Of course, this is not a good sign of European unity. "
On March 22, Russian President Putin arranged for Russian troops to send military doctors, special disinfectors and other medical equipment to Italy after speaking to Italian Prime Minister Conte.
The Italian News quotes an anonymous "high-level political official" that 80% of Russia's aid is almost useless to Italy.
The source accused Russia of launching the geopolitics and diplomacy charm offensive.
Attlio Fontana, Governor of Lombardi, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media and expressed his gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft carrying medical assistance to the United States.
The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said, "In providing assistance to American colleagues, it was believed that once the United States medical equipment and material manufacturers restored their capacity, they would be rewarded if necessary. "
NATO "Defence 2020" military exercises planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic Sea are the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the Cold War, which will be reduced.
Kate Hudson, Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Movement, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the face of a public health crisis around the world, exercises endanger not only the lives of the United States and many European participating national soldiers, but also the residents of the country where the exercise was affected by the epidemic, with about 24 members and 15 other current or former politicians infected.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders requesting assistance.

Multiple supply shortages can be attributed to the outbreak of new coronary viruses, which originated in the global increase in the use of equipment, panic shopping, and the interruption of plant and logistics operations.
The US Food and Drug Regulatory Authority issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supply interruption.
There is a lot of panic shopping, leading to the emptying of essentials such as food, toilet paper and bottled water on the shelf, causing a shortage of supplies.
Especially the technology industry has been warning the delay in the shipment of electronics.
According to the Director General of the World Health Organization, Tandesse, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to an increase in prices of such products 20 times higher than usual, and the supply of medical supplies has been delayed by 4 to 6 months.
The World Health Organization warned that this would pose a threat to medical personnel.
In Australia, the epidemic offers a new opportunity for buying people to sell Australian products to China.
This activity led to a shortage of infant formula powder in some supermarkets and was then banned by the Australian Government. Despite the very serious COVID-19 in northern Italy and Wuhan, there was no serious food shortage.
Measures taken by China and Italy in response to the accumulation of key products and illegal trade have been very successful, avoiding serious food shortages, while Europe and North America are expected to arise.
Agricultural production in northern Italy has not declined significantly, but industry representatives believe that prices may rise.
The removal of food shelf is only temporary, even in Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released pork reserves to guarantee the full nutrition of the population.
Italy has similar laws that require food producers to supply such emergency reserves.
The damage to the global economy has had an impact on China: a media report on March 16 said that two months before 2020, affected by the government's epidemic containment measures, China’s economy was hit by a huge shock and retail sales fell by 20.5 per cent.

As a result of this, many airlines have cancelled flights because of the decline in demand, including British Airlines, East China and Australian Airlines, while British feeder Flybe failed.
The heavy damage to the cruise industry is unprecedented.
Many railway stations and ferry ports were also forced to close down.
The epidemic was just in springtime, and it was a major tourist season because of China's spring break.
The state and local governments have cancelled a series of events involving crowd gathering, including the annual spring festival, and private enterprises have closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.

The epidemic has recently led to many religious services, major sports and other social events (such as festivals, concerts, technical seminars and fashion performances) and this negative impact will rapidly increase.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the holy week of the Holy Week in Rome in the last week of April.
Many parishs suggest that older Christians stay home and do not need to attend mass on Sundays; some churches hold service through radio, live online or television, and some churches allow worship in cars.
As the Roman Catholic district closed its large and large churches, no Christian pilgrimages were seen in St. Peter's Square, and other religious groups also cancelled or restricted the worship or limited public assembly at churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and teachers.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the epidemic, and the Holy Land was forced to close, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilists and their residents from entering the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
This epidemic has caused the worst damage to the world's sports agenda since the Second World War.
Most major sports events were forced to cancel or postpone, including 2019-20 European Championships, 2019-20 British Super League, 2020 European Championships, 2019-20 NBA seasons and 2019-20 National hockey Federation seasons.
The outbreak interrupted the 2020 Summer Olympic Plan, scheduled for the end of July; the IOC announced on March 24 that the event would be "rearranged beyond 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021." Casinos and other lottery sites around the world were closed and live poker competitions were forced to postpone or cancel.
This has led many gamblers to online gambling, and many online gambling sites reported a significant increase in their new registration rates.
A lot of big theatres, like Broadway, have suspended all performances.
Some artists have also managed to continue to create and share works via the Internet to replace traditional live performances, such as live concerts, or create a web-based festival for artists to perform, publish and promote their works.
On the Internet, many web-based fans with the theme of the new coronary virus spread, and in the moment of uncertainty spread, many people are beginning to respond in a sense of humor and attention.
Xenophobia and racial discrimination have been increasing since the outbreak of COVID-19.
Many countries and territories, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific, have experienced fear, suspicion and hatred.
Many reports in February this year (which were still limited to China) recorded racist emotions of different groups around the world against Chinese, arguing that Chinese should be infected with viruses or accept so-called legitimate revenge.
Some African countries have also experienced an increase in anti-China sentiment.
According to reports, many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have been subjected to geographical discrimination.
Both online and online, there are voices that support Chinese and residents of the severe epidemic.
As the epidemic spreads to other hot countries, Italy became the first country in Europe to have a serious outbreak of COVID-19, and the population from the country may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Some citizens of Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Korea and others initially signed petitions requesting the Chinese from entering their country to try to stop the spread of diseases.
In Japan, the topic "China DontComeTo Japan" was launched on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported that racial abuse and attacks are increasing.
President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the new coronary virus "China virus", and critics believe that their statements were racist and anti-China.
Ukrainian protesters attacked the bus from Wuhan to New Sanzari, containing Ukrainian and foreign evacuations.
Students from northeast India (near China) and attending major cities in India were also harassed by the outbreak of a new coronary virus.
Dilip Gosh, President of the West Bengal State of the Indian People's Party, said that the Chinese destroyed nature, "So God will avenge them."
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta as "mistakes". In China, the xenophobia and racial discrimination suffered by non-Chinese residents were also exacerbated by the prevalence, and foreigners described as "foreign garbage" and should be the target of "spam disposal".
Many newspapers with pay walls have removed the payment wall for partial or all reports of new coronary viruses.
Many scientific publishers have published scientific papers on the epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to share their findings quickly on preprint servers like bioRxiv.

2019 Laboratory tests for respiratory coronary virus diseases (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 viruses include detection of the existence of viruses and detection of antibodies after infection.
RT-PCR detects the RNA of the coronary virus and thus determine whether there is a virus in the sample.
This test is a specific test for SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It can be used to determine whether it has recently been infected or active.
Antibody testing (serotest) can be used for diagnosis and group monitoring.
Antibody tests show how many people are infected with viruses, including those with minor symptoms without reporting or symptoms.
This test results determine the accurate mortality rate of disease and the level of immunization of groups in the population.
As of the limited number of tests, no country/region could provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population by March 2020.
As of March 23, no country/region tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests completed by countries/regions varies significantly.
This difference may also seriously affect reported case mortality, which in some countries may be severely overestimated.
Real-time retrospective polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests using throats, reliable results can only be achieved within the first week of the infection of the virus.
Normally, results are available within hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR tests using swabs can only be achieved within the first week of the infection of the virus.
Then the virus disappeared in his throat, but it continued to breed in the lungs.
For infected persons tested in the second week after infection, samples can be replaced with deep breath extracts obtained through straws or can use coughing (slurp).
RRT-PCR was released at the Charité Hospital in Berlin in January 2020, one of the early PCR tests and became the basis for 250,000 test reagent boxes distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom also developed a test method. On January 28, 2020, the Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical level based on PCR SARS-CoV-2 test reagent box (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It seeks all the "E" genes shared by the beta coronary virus, and SARS-CoV-2-specific RdRp genes. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the China National Drug Supervisory Authority on the production of emergency approvals for the production of SARS-CoV-2 test reagent boxes based on PCR. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed 2019 new coronary virus (2019-nCoV) to the Public Health Laboratory through the International Reagent Resource Department, real time RT-PCR diagnostic panel.
The early version of the test reagent box uses three genetic tests, one of which is unable to determine the results due to reagent defects, while the detection bottlenecks in Atlanta CDC; this led to less than 100 samples successfully processed daily throughout February 2020.
The test method, which contains two parts, was not determined to be reliable until February 28, 2020, and the state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the US Food and Drug Regulatory Authority under emergency use authorization.
LabCorp announced that RT-PCR-based COVID-19 tests could be conducted nationwide from March 5, 2020.
Quest Diagnostics also announced that it would provide a nationwide COVID-19 test from March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limit announced; sample collection and processing must be implemented as required by the CDC.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests are developed and produced by the National Research Centre for Virusology and Biotechnology (VECTOR).
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered with the Russian Health Supervisory Authority. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the Meo Clinic developed a reagent box for detectable COVID-19 infections. On March 13, 2020, a test method of Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA, which could complete a large number of tests within 3.5 hours, thus achieving approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, FDA issued emergency access authorizations for testing using Abbott Laboratories (EUA); FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, a test of about 45 minutes of Cepheid was also authorized by the FDA for emergency use.
The FDA has approved a test method to replace PCR with temperature-enhanced technologies such as nucleic acid.
Since the method does not require a series of temperature cycles, positive results can be achieved in only five minutes, and negative results can be determined in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such devices in the United States, and Abbott is expected to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is developing a test using monoclon antibodies (in conjunction with new coronary viruses), hoping it will provide results within 15 to 20 minutes as fast influenza testing.
A summary of March 2020 concluded that "in the early stages of the virus, the diagnostic value of the chest is very small, and the performance of CT [computer fault scan] may be obvious, even before the symptoms appear."
Typical features of CT include double-pulmonary multi-leaf grinding glass, with outer-week asymmetric and post-part cloth.
As the disease progresses, it will develop the under-breathing, rock-crawling and lung changes.
A study by PCR and CT compared to Wuhan (the initial outbreak of the current pandemic) shows that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, but the CT is less accurate, and many of its image features overlap with other pneumonia and diseases.
As of March 2020, the American Society of Radiology had suggested that "CT should not be used to screen COVID-19 or as a front-line detection tool for diagnosis of COVID-19". Since March 2020, the CDC recommended the use of PCR for initial screening.
Some of the immune reactions to infection are antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect individual infections around seven days after the symptoms begin to determine the immune situation of the monitored population.
High-throughput automated systems in many clinical laboratories can be measured above, but their availability depends on productivity of the systems.
For CLT, while the immune response can be tracked by sequence samples, it usually uses an external blood sample to measure.
For PoCT, a blood sample is generally obtained using skin piercing.
No extraction steps are required before testing, which is different from the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, the FDA approved the detection methods declared by 29 entities that are now able to distribute their antibodies test reagent boxes.
As of 7 April 2020, the FDA had approved only one test under the emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, the Omont Medical Experimental Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics test reagent boxes were approved in Europe, which can be tested for virus detection in blood samples IgG and Iga antibodies.
Hundreds of samples can be detected within hours, so, on the RNA, it's much faster than the traditional PCR.
Normally, the antibodies can be detected 14 days after the beginning of the infection. In early April, the UK found that none of them were good enough to use the antibodies test reagent box it purchased.
Hong Kong has established a mechanism for suspected patients to live home, "the emergency room provides sample test tubes to patients", which spit saliva into the test tube and then send the test tube back and receive results later. NHS announced that it tested a home-based programme to detect suspected cases so that patients can eliminate the risk of infection of others when they travel to hospital or to eliminate the risk of disinfection of ambulances after using ambulances. In the case of free access to COVID-19, medical professionals can take appropriate precautions to extract samples.
In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Doctors stated on March 2, that non-inpatient institutions were capable of conducting about 12,000 tests a day, and 10,700 were tested last week.
If testing is required by the doctor, the cost is covered by health insurance.
According to the Director of Robert Koch Institute, Germany, the total test capability per week in Germany is 160,000 copies.
As of March 19, a number of major cities had been provided with free access tests.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown, as only the number of people reported positive.
An initial laboratory survey showed that as of the 12th week of 2020, at least 483,295 samples (including within the 12th week of 2020) detected 33,491 samples (6.9%) SARS-CoV-2 positive. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method for testing 64 patient samples simultaneously, i.e., samples, and only further tests were found to be positive. In Wuhan, the Great Gene (BGI) temporarily established a 2000 flat-metre emergency testing laboratory called Fire Eye, which was used on 5 February 2020, and more than 10,000 samples could be processed daily.
The laboratory was built for five days under the supervision of Wang, the founder of the Chinese gene, and modelling showed that if it hadn't met the above-mentioned detection capability, the case in Hubei would be 47% higher, and the corresponding treatment of isolation costs would double.
Following the Wuhan Laboratory, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai immediately established the Fire Eye Laboratory, which is currently established in 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, laboratory detection daily flux was 50,000 copies per day. Origami Assays released open source, multi-road design, and up to 1122 patient samples can be tested through 93 measurements alone. These balanced designs can be operated in small laboratories without automatic fluid transfer.
As of March, the shortage and insufficient quantity of reagents had become an obstacle to large-scale testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some sponsors to explore sample preparation programmes, which involved heating samples to 98 degrees C (208 F) to 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. The United Arab Emirates announced on March 31 that it had now conducted new coronary virus tests of its larger population, more than any other country and is expanding the level of testing to allow a large number of people to be tested.
The way to achieve this detection capability is to use the drive-through test on the one hand and to fund Group 42 and the Chinese gene (based on its "Fire Eye" emergency testing laboratory in China) to build high-through laboratories to respond to the needs of large-scale population detection.
The laboratory was built in 14 days to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, the first laboratory in the world to operate outside China.
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States have developed different detection methods for various parts of the coronary virus genetic mapping.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German method of producing test reagent boxes to send reagent boxes to low-income countries that do not have resources to develop their own reagent boxes.
The German methodology was published on January 17, 2020; the programme developed by the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention was available after January 28, thereby limiting the detection capabilities of the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test reagent boxes in the early stages of the outbreak, which were unable to provide sufficient test boxes to meet demand and health experts' recommendations.
On the contrary, experts believe that extensive testing in Korea is helpful to reduce the spread of new coronary viruses.
Thanks to the testing capacity established by the Korean government over the past few years, it is concentrated in private sector laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for additional testing programmes as the best way to slow down the development of the COVID-19 epidemic. The widespread spread of viruses has led to great demand for testing, which has led to hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of swabs and chemical reagents began to become tense.
In March 2020, China reported its detection of the accuracy of reagent boxes.
In the United States, the test reagent box developed by the CDC was "deficit"; then the government removed bureaucracy barriers to private laboratory testing. Spain purchased the test box from the Chinese company Shenzhen Iri Biotechnology Ltd. and found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explained that the inaccuracy of the results of the test may have been caused by the incorrect collection of samples or the misuse of the test reagent box.
The Spanish Cabinet stated that the reagent box that returned the wrong result and replaced it with another reagent box provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test boxes purchased from China by the Czech Republic was incorrect. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test boxes from China, and found inaccurate results.
The Prime Minister Matovia suggested that these test boxes should be thrown into the Danube. Ate-Kara of the Ministry of Health of Turkey said that Turkey had purchased a "high error rate" from China and did not "input them into use".
Testing and isolation and tracking the history of exposure of SARS-CoV-2 positive personnel, with positive effects.
Researchers working in the city of V, Italy (the first case of COVID-19 patients in Italy), two rounds of tests were conducted for groups of about 3,400 people, about 10 days apart.
About half of them tested positive and non-symmetrical, and all cases detected were isolated.
By taking travel restrictions on communities, new infections have been completely eliminated.
Through large-scale tracking of contacts, restrictions on entry travel, detection and isolation, 2020 coronary virus transmission in Singapore is far slower than other developed countries/regions and Singapore does not take extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail sites.
Singapore cancelled many activities and started recommending residents to stay home on March 28, but the school resumed on March 23rd after vacation.
Several other countries/areas, such as Ireland and Korea, have also controlled the massive epidemic of disease through large-scale tracking contacts, restrictions on entry travel, detection and isolation and less radical blockade measures.
A statistical study found that the lower the case mortality rate in countries compared to the number of deaths, the lower the case mortality rate may be due to the ability of these countries to better detect groups with only minor symptoms or symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have detection capability and national laboratories handle COVID-19 with limited experience, send their first five positive and top 10 negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, one in North America, one in Australia.
In the following chart, the "test positive %" column is influenced by the national testing policy.
In other cases, the positive check-out rate is higher than in countries where all citizens, whether or not they show symptoms, are tested only.
Wash your hands, also known as hand cleaning, to clean the hand with dust, fat, microbes or other useless substances.
At some "critical moments" every day, washing hands with soap can prevent the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which can be transmitted through shit-mouth.
If people don't wash their hands before they touch their eyes, noses or mouths (i.e. sticky film), they may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or common cold.
Five key moments to wash your hands with soap in one day: before and after defecation, clean the child's hips or after changing diapers, before feeding, before and after eating, before and after handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
If there is no soap and water, you can clean your hands with grass and ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands in the following cases:
Before you prepare food, in the process and after.
Take care of the patient.
After changing diapers or cleaning like a toilet child's hip.
Slurp your nose, cough or sneeze.
Touch animals, animal food or animal excreta.
Medical personnel hand health means health habits related to medical procedures.
Wash your hands before taking out drugs or medical care, which prevents or minimizes the spread of disease ...
In the medical field, the main purpose of washing hands is to remove pathogens (bacterial, virus or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that may harm humans or cause disease on their hands.
Handwashing is particularly important for people working in food processing or in the medical field, but for the public, washing hands is also important.
(b) The health benefits of handwashing are significant, including the minimization of influenza, coronary viruses and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
And reduce infant mortality at home.
A 2013 study showed that improving hand-washing habits have a slight boost to the increase in the height of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality associated with respiratory systems and diarrhoea diseases can be reduced by promoting simple behavioural changes (e.g. handwashing with soap).
This simple act can reduce the death rate of the above-mentioned diseases by almost 50%.
The intervention in promoting handwashing can reduce the occurrence of about one third of diarrhoea incidents, which is equivalent to providing clean water sources in low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap reduces diarrhoea events by 48 per cent. As self-issued in households, schools and communities around the world, handwashing with soap is the most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections.
Pneumonia, as a major acute respiratory infection, is the primary cause of death of children under five years of age, which takes about 1.8 million children's lives every year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause nearly 3.5 million deaths per year.
UNICEF stated that, compared to any single vaccine or medical intervention, the use of washing hands with soap before and after toilet can save more lives, reducing diarrhoea-induced deaths by almost half and one quarter of deaths caused by acute respiratory infections.
As part of the water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) project, other sanitation interventions are usually taken while promoting handwashing.
Handwashing can also prevent septic disease transmitted through direct physical contact.
Handwashing can have a slight adverse effect, i.e. frequent hand washing can cause skin drying, thereby causing skin damage.
A 2012 Danish study found that overwashing can cause skin itching, cracking, called hand rash or hand skin inflammation, which is particularly common among medical staff.
Over-frequency handwashing is also considered one of the symptoms of coercion (OCD).
To reduce disease dung-student transmission, five key moments must wash hands with soap in one day: after toilet (pee, defecation), after cleaning children's hips (replacement of urine), before feeding, before dinner and after handling raw meat, fish or bird meat.
To prevent the spread of disease, washing hands should also be made in the right way: to deal with the cut or wound; sneeze, cough or snot; touch animal excreta or after handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries/regions, the proportion of hand washing hands with soap is low.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7 per cent of households were used to wash hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest percentage of 97 per cent; the United States was close to average, or 77 per cent; China was the lowest percentage of 23 per cent.
The Basic Health Care Plan, implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of a large-scale initiative to improve the health and learning of children.
The core of this national plan is to deworm twice a year, accompanied by washing hands with soap and brushing teeth with fluorinated toothpaste.
In Indonesia, the plan was successfully implemented.
Water is integrated into soap or cleaning agents, which better remove microorganisms from skin.
The main effect of soap and cleaning agents is to reduce solubility and improve solubility.
The use of water alone cannot effectively clean the skin, as fat and protein (parts of organic soil) are not easily dissolved in water.
But cleaning hands requires reasonable water...
Solid soap may contain bacteria left when used before, because they can be reused.
A small number of studies have investigated the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap, and concluded that bacteria could not be transferred because bacteria were washed away by foam.
But the CDC still claims "preferably to use non-contact liquid soap".
Antibacterial soap has been widely promoted among healthy people.
So far, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antibacterials or disinfectants has chosen antibiotics resistance microorganisms in nature.
However, anti-bacterial soap contains common anti-bacterial agents such as trichlorosa, and trichlorosa has a large number of resistant microbicides.
So, even if anti-bacterial soap is not chosen for antibiotics resistance, anti-bacterial soap may not be as effective as propaganda.
In addition to surface active agents and skin-care agents, complex formulations may contain acid (acetic acid, anti-fasthetic acid, lactate), anti-bacterial active phenylacetic acid, and more skin modems (thirium, vitamins, mint alcohol, plant extraction). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon Institute of Public Health shows that ordinary soap has the same effect as consumer anti-bacterial soap with trichlorosa in preventing disease and removing hands.
Hot water washes comfortable, but it's not enough heat to kill bacteria.
Bacteria breed very quickly at body temperature (37 degrees C).
But warm soap water is more effective than cold soap water in removing natural oil containing soil and bacteria.
Scientific research has confirmed that the use of warm water has not worked to reduce microorganisms in hand, contrary to the general view.
Water-free handwashing fluids or non-bicide handwashers are non-water-based hand cleaners.
In the late 1990s and early twenty-first century, non-water-based alcohol hand cleaners (also known as alcohol handwashing, free of fungi or handwashing) were popular.
Most of these handwasher formulations contain isopropanol or ethanol, and add denser such as Capom to form gel, or add wetting agents such as glycerine to form liquids, or foams for easy use and to mitigate the drying of the skin caused by alcohol.
Adding diluting hydrogen peroxide can further increase antibacterial activity. At least 60 to 95% of alcohol-free handwashing fluids can effectively kill bacteria.
Alcohol hand-scratch can kill bacteria, multi-drug resistance bacteria (MRSA) and anti-Vancin intestinal fungus (VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory cynic virus (RSV), nose virus, pox, flu and hepatitis, and fungi.
After 30 seconds of alcohol hand-scratch, it can kill 99.97% of bacteria on their hands (reduced by 3.5 grade, similar to 35 dB) and can reduce bacteria on their hands by 99.999% to 99.999% (4-5 quantitative levels) in one minute. Free handwashing fluids are the most effective for bacteria, while some viruses have slightly less effective.
Alcohol handwashing fluids are almost completely ineffective to viruses like Norovirus, also known as Novak, Norwalk.
Wash your hands and backs and between fingers and all fingers for about 30 seconds until liquid, foam or gel dry.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends better wash hands than use free handwashing hand fluid, especially when it looks dirty.
It is increasingly used because of the ease of use of these hand-washing fluids and can quickly deactive microorganisms; however, they should not replace the right handwashing unless there is no soap and water available.
The frequent use of alcohol free handwashing fluids can cause skin drying unless skin and/or wetting agents are added in the formulation.
Glycerine and/or other skin lubricants can be added to the formulation to reduce or eliminate the dry skin caused by alcohol.
In clinical trials, alcohol-free handwashing fluids containing skin or anti-bacterial cleaners can significantly reduce skin irritation and skin drying.
Allergies are rare in contact with skin inflammation, exposure to measles syndrome or additives in alcohol or alcohol hand fluids.
Alcohol free handwashing is less likely to trigger irritating skin inflammation than to wash hands with soap and water, which is one of its attractive reasons.
Waterless cleaners, though effective, do not remove organic matter on their hands, just disinfect them.
So, free handwashing fluids work less than soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, because these pathogens are still in hand.
The effect of the non-alcoholic handwashing fluid depends to a large extent on the composition and formulation, which has always been much worse than alcohol and alcohol handwashing.
Recently, formulations using phenylzachlorammonium have been proven to have sustained and cumulative antibacterial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to be reduced after reuse, perhaps due to a gradual adverse skin reaction.
Many people in low-income communities can't afford soap, using grass and wood or earth instead.
Grass and wood or earth are better than washing hands with water alone, but less than soap.
One of these problems is that if earth or grass ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may accelerate the spread of disease, rather than slow transmission.
Like soap, grass ash is a disinfectant because it forms a alkaline solution when it comes to water.
WHO suggests that if no soap is available, it can be replaced by grass and wood ash or sand.
The correct hand-washing steps recommended by the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission are as follows:
Wet hands with mobile warm water or cold water.
The water flow is recommended because the vertical basin may be contaminated, and the temperature seems to be not very relevant.
Use a full amount of soap to make foams, while cleaning your backs, fingers and nails.
Soap removes bacteria from skin, and research shows that people often wash their hands more completely when using soap instead of washing their hands alone.
At least 20 seconds to wash.
Cleaning can generate friction, which helps remove bacteria from skin, the longer the wash time, the more bacteria removed.
Clean it with water.
Washing with a water basin can cause re-pollution.
Dry or dry with clean towels.
The wet hands are more easily contaminated, thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers and nails that are most often ignored.
Artificial nails and broken nail polish may hide microbes.
It is usually recommended that wetting emulsions be used to avoid dry hands; skin drying can cause skin damage, thereby increasing the risk of infection transmission.
Where developing countries are unable to access running water and/or soap, low-cost measures can be provided to facilitate hand washing, such as water-saving programmes, such as water-saving washing programmes, such as simple taps and other low-cost methods, where limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries). Water-saving washing programmes, such as simple taps and other low-cost methods.
The simple tap technology is simple, hangs a water can with rope, and then pours a little water into your hand through a pedal, and then use soap.
Effective drying is an important step in the hand health process, but there are some arguments about the most effective way of doing it in public health.
More and more research shows that paper towels are more sanitary than electric dry phones provided in many bathrooms.
In 2008, Westminster University, London, conducted a study sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium in the paper towel industry, comparing paper towels, warm wind dry phones and more modern jet dry phones, in terms of hygiene.
Dry your hands with warm wind dry phones, and found that the total number of bacteria on the finger increased by an average of 194%, and an average increase of 254% in the total number of bacteria on hand.
And with a jet dry phone, the total number of bacteria on the finger increased by 42%, and the total number of bacteria on the palms increased by 15%.
After washing hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on the finger decreased by an average of 76% and a 77% reduction in the total number of hand-held bacteria. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether various dry hands methods could cause cross-infection among other bathroom users and bathroom facilities.
The jet dry phone allegedly sprayed air out of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 miles per hour) capable of blowing off the hand and the microbes on the machine, which could contaminate other bathroom users and bathroom facilities within 2 metres.
The use of warm wind dry phones can spread microbes to 0.25 meters outside the dry phone.
The results of the use of paper towel dry hands show that there will be no serious microbiological transmission. In 2005, T'V Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to assess different ways of doing it.
The following changes were observed in the number of bacteria after the dry hands:
The study was involved by many different dry mobile phone producers, comparing these dry phones with paper towels.
During the trip, without soap and water, you can choose to use hand disinfected wet towels to wash their hands.
Alcohol free handwashing should have at least 60% alcohol.
Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered in 1846 that washing hands can effectively prevent the spread of diseases in hospitals, but only a long time later, medical personnel were forced to wash their hands.
Hospitals use feedback electronic devices to alert hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
A study found that the rate of infection has decreased after the use of these equipment.
Medical personnel wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, using a full amount of soap and water or gel to produce foam and wash their hands.
Hands on each other's fingers.
If there's a cripple between nails, you can clean it with a hard brush.
Because there may still be bacteria left in the water left on hand, it must be fully cleaned and dry with clean towels.
After drying, the tap should be used to close the tap (open the exit door with a tissue if necessary).
This prevents re-contaminated hands due to exposure to these surfaces.
In health care, the purpose of washing hands is to eliminate pathogens microorganisms and avoid transmission.
Reports in New England Medical Journal indicate that in most medical environments there are still cases where handwashing is not acceptable, and a large number of medical personnel often forget to wash their hands before they contact patients, leading to the spread of microorganisms.
A study shows that the correct handwashing and other simple procedures can reduce the blood flow rate associated with the catheter by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet that demonstrate standard handwashing and hand-washing methods in medical institutions.
The organization also posted a draft hand health guide on its website to obtain public opinion.
Whitby et al. made an overview.
If there is a need to confirm compliance with the regulations, commercial equipment can be measured and validated by the health of the enemy.
The World Health Organization recommends "five moments" for washing hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluid
Before the sterile operation and
After caring for the patient, adding anti-bacterial chemicals to soap ( "sap" or "antibacterial soap") can make handwashers fungicides.
This fungicide operation may be required before surgery or in an environment where there is a large number of antibiotics resistant microorganisms. When "cleaning" hands for surgery, there must be a water tap that can be opened and shut down without contact, handwashing the sterile towels used to dry hands after washing hands, other sterile tools for cleaning nails and other sterile tools for cleaning nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This program requires washing hands, forearms until elbows, usually wash 2-6 minutes.
It doesn't take long to wash (10 minutes).
When washing, the water on the forearm must be prevented from flowing back to your hand.
After washing your hands, dry hands with sterile cloths and put on their surgical clothes.
To reduce bacterial transmission, it is best to wash hands or use non-bicide handwashing fluids before and after contact with patients.
To control the infection of glucose in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands comes from a 20% hand wash frequency, and when the frequency of cleaning hands increases to over 35%, the further benefits are extremely limited.
The use of anti-bacterial soap to wash hands can lead to more than triple the proportion of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food. After comparing alcohol hand-scraping hands with anti-bacterial soap (30 seconds respectively), the proportion of bacterial infections with alcohol-scratching is 26% lower than anti-bacterial soap.
However, soap and water can be improved by training staff on how to wash hands, increase the supply of alcohol hand fluids and interventions such as written and oral alerts to employees.
Further study is needed for the most effective interventions in various medical environments.
In developing countries, hand washing hands with soap is considered an important tool for cost-effective health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or washing facilities in people ' s homes, schools and workplaces makes universal handwashing a challenge.
For example, in most rural African areas, even if there are cheap ways to build a handwashing table, the situation of handwashing taps near each private bathroom or public health room is very rare.
But low wash-washing may also be a deep-rooted habit, not because of the lack of soap or water.
Promoting and promoting the use of soap washing can affect policy formulation, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and leading to long-term behavioural changes among the population.
To be effective, oversight and evaluation must be conducted.
A systematic assessment of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing the proportion of hand-washing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and that social marketing activities are less effective. One example of promoting hand washing in schools is the Tristar approach introduced by UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and cheap measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can rise from one star to the highest three stars.
Handwashing activities could include the construction of a handwashing table to reduce disease and child mortality.
Another example of handwashing awareness activities is World Handwashing Day, which aims to try to make behavioural changes. As a result of the 2019-20 coronary virus epidemic, UNICEF promoted the use of a hand-washing emoticon symbol.
Few studies have studied the relationship between the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries and the years of avoiding disability adjustment (DALY).
However, reports indicate that the cost-effectiveness of promoting soap washing is more significant than other water and sanitation interventions.
The first to recognize the importance of washing hands for human health - especially those who were weak (e.g. mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals) were two pioneers in hand health in the mid-19th century: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, founder of Modern Care, England.
At that time, most people still thought that infection was caused by the smell of evil.
The outbreak of food-borne diseases and medical infections in the 1980s led to a more active advocacy of hand health by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, highlighting hand hygiene as an important way to prevent infection transmission.
The outbreak of pig flu in 2009 and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have made many countries more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect people from such infectious diseases.
For example, Germany will hang a poster by the handwashing pool in public health rooms, office buildings and airport bathrooms.
The word "doing" means someone who says he's not responsible for something or being involved in something.
It originated from the Bible Matthews, and Pontius Pilate washed his hands after deciding to nail Jesus and then evolved into a wide range of English-speaking groups.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth started to wash her mind for trying to clean the desired stains, showing her guilt about her crimes and encouraging her husband's crimes.
Studies show that people who think or imagine immoral behaviour tend to wash their hands more often than others and often value handwashing facilities more often.
Moreover, those who can wash their hands after the idea of immoral behaviour are unlikely to engage in other "purified" compensation actions, such as volunteers.
Religion requires washing hands for hygiene and symbolic purposes. The symbolic handwashing of water when washing hands without soap is part of many religious landmark handwashing gifts, including the Bahai faith, Hinduism, bathing and handwashing in Judaism, clean manners, handwashing in Christianity and small purity in Islam. Religions also have sanitary handwashing provisions, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam demand to wash their hands after the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam demand to wash their hands before and after dinner.
COVID-19 Workplace Control
COVID-19 Workplace control means the use of occupational safety and health measures to prevent coronary virus diseases 2019 (COVID-19).
The properness of risk control in the workplace depends on the specific work site and tasks and should be determined on the risk assessment of sources of exposure, the extent of community disease and risk factors that may be exposed to COVID-19.
In accordance with the requirements of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure risk work is least associated with the public and other colleagues, and therefore recommends basic infection prevention measures, including handwashing, encouraging employees to isolate their homes after illness, compliance with respiratory rituals and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium exposure risk work includes the need for frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients who may be infected by continuous community transmission or international travel.
Including staff who have access to the general public, such as schools, high population density working environments and some large-scale retail environments.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, the group should use efficient air filters and sneeze protections for ventilation, wear personal protective equipment and other hazard control measures when exposed to COVID-19 patients.
OSHA considers that there is a high risk of exposure to medical personnel and staff members who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients, and the exposure risk becomes extremely high if staff members perform aerosol-producing or suspected COVID-19 patients or collected or processed samples from them.
Hazard control measures applicable to such personnel include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for their work tasks.
COVID-19 outbreak could have a serious impact on the workplace.
Staff members may be absent from duty due to illness, need to take care of others or fear of exposure.
Business models may also change, including changes in commodity demand or access to these goods (e.g. shopping at non-peak hours, or use distribution or free delivery services).
Finally, product logistics from the severe area of COVID-19 may be interrupted.
These programmes address risk levels associated with various workplaces and work tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors from the family and community environment and risk factors for individual workers, such as older persons or groups with chronic diseases.
These plans also outline the prevention and control measures needed to address these risks and emergency plans for situations that may occur as a result of the outbreak.
The prevention and response plan for infectious diseases may need to be subject to national or local recommendations.
Targets to address the outbreak include reducing inter-staff transmission, protecting populations with high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining operations and minimize adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
In addition, responses are affected by the extent of disease in the community where enterprises are located.
Hazard control levels are a widely used control framework for occupational safety and health, which is used to group hazard control measures according to effectiveness.
If COVID-19 is not completely eliminated, the most effective control is engineering control, followed by administrative control, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering control means the isolation of employees from work-related hazards rather than relying on staff behaviour, which is also the least cost-effective solution.
Administrative control means changing work policies or procedures and requires staff or employers to act on their own ...
Personal protective equipment (PPE) has less control than engineering and administrative controls, but helps prevent some exposures.
All types of PPE are selected according to the level of risk faced by staff, equipped with (e.g. respirators) and must always be properly worn, regularly checked and maintained, replaced, and properly removed, clean, stored or treated to avoid pollution.
Under the terms of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure risk work has the least professional contact with the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended that all workplaces take basic infection prevention measures, including handwashing, suggesting that sick employees be isolated, coughing or sneezing, providing paper towels and trash cans, preparing remote office, and making them work from work, to persuade employees from using other tools and equipment, and maintaining day-to-day cleaning and disinfection in the workplace.
Timely identification and isolation of potential infectious individuals are key to protecting workplace personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who show acute respiratory symptoms should be isolated from their homes for at least 24 hours until they determine that there is no heat, heat signs and any other symptoms, the sick leave policy should be flexible, allowing employees to care for sick families and should clearly inform them of the policy.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure risk work includes the need for frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients within 6 feet (1.8 metres), but may cause individuals to spread their work on a continuous community near the workplace or infected SARS-CoV-2 as a result of the possible recent access to the COVID-19 epidemic area.
Such staff include staff members who are employed in schools, high population density working environments and some large retail environments who are exposed to the general public. Engineering control measures for this group and high-risk groups include the installation of efficient air filters, improved ventilation effects, transparent plastic sneeze protection devices and the installation of a free window to provide customer services. Administrative control of this group and high-risk group includes encouraging sick employees to isolate their homes, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, establishing a fault wheel system, cancellation of non-necess travel to COVID-19 outbreak sites, developing emergency communication plans, including forums that answer staff questions, provide staff with up-to-date education and training on the risk of hand-washing, providing protection and protective clothing to staff with protective clothing and protective equipment to provide personal protection and protective equipment for the use of protective clothing.
Such staff better need respirators.
If someone is sick on a plane, protective measures should be taken to protect staff and other passengers, including six feet away from other passengers, designated an crew member to serve the patient, provide masks to the patient, or ask the patient to cover his mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The crew should wear one-time medical gloves when caring for sick travellers, touch body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces. If the patient travellers have fever, continuous cough or respiratory difficulties, the crew should also wear additional personal protective equipment.
Gloves and other one-time items should be treated in biological hazard bags, and then clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazardous control measures also include delayed travel during illness. If heat or other symptoms occur on board, self-separated and immediately inform the medical room on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be conducted in the isolated cabin. For schools and childcare sites, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control recommends that if infected persons have appeared in school, regardless of community proliferation, the corresponding schools and childcare sites should be completely cleaned or disinfected in the short term.
For medium- and low-level community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as the cancellation of field trips, gatherings and sports classes, other large gatherings such as choirs or cafeteria meals, increasing distance between desks, error peaks and departures, limiting unnecessary visitors to visit and arrange separate health offices for children with influenza symptoms.
If the community is highly transmitted, in addition to the implementation of social distance strategies, it may be considered to extend the suspension. For law enforcement officials who implement routine activities, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control considers it to be low in direct health risks.
It is recommended that COVID-19 confirmed patients or suspected individuals be required to act according to the same level of protection as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during the arrest process, staff members should clean and disinfect their watch belts and equipment before using home cleaning spray or rag cleaning, and shall comply with standard personal protective equipment sealing and disposal procedures and clothing sealing and cleaning procedures.
OSHA believes that certain health care and residential staff are at high or very high risk of exposure.
High exposure risk staff include physical access to health care for known or suspected COVID-19 infected persons, support, laboratory and medical transport staff.
Exposure becomes extremely high if staff members perform foam generation procedures for known or suspected COVID-19 patients or collect or treat samples of infected persons or suspected infected persons.
The foam generation program includes intubation, cough-inducing procedures, bronchial lenses, some dental procedures and examinations, or physical cavity sample collection.
High-exposure flat staff include staff involved in the organization of the dead, who were confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19; the exposure risk is higher if the autopsy is performed. Additional engineering measures for this risk group also include isolation rooms for COVID-19 confirmed or suspected cases, including in the implementation of the foam generation process.
Some health care facilities and morgues can also be equipped with specialized negative pressure ventilation systems.
Biosafety 3 preventive measures should be taken in the processing of samples.
The World Health Organization (WTO) recommends that different waiting areas be classified for patients according to whether the patient is suspected COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Authority recommends that persons working within 6 feet of known or suspected of infection of SARS-CoV-2 and those who perform the foam generation program should wear respirators.
The United States requires the use of N95 filters or better masks in a comprehensive and written respiratory protection programme environment such as health testing, training, medical examinations, etc.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and improve the comfort of staff. WHO does not recommend the use of protective clothing, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that is not transmitted through body fluid.
WHO recommends that the entry point screening staff wear a medical surgical mask.
For staff members who need to collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients and provide care or transfer services to patients without having to perform the foam generation process, WHO recommends that it use medical surgical masks, goggles or masks, robes and gloves.
If you want to perform a foam generation program, you must replace medical surgical masks with N95 or FFP2 masks.
Given the inadequate availability of personal protective equipment worldwide, WHO proposes to allow direct care workers to enter rooms of COVID-19 patients through telemedicine, transparent windows, only when specific tasks do need to use personal protective equipment, continue to use the same respirators, monitor and coordinate the supply chain of personal protective equipment and measures such as masks that do not encourage non-symmetric personnel to reduce the demand for personal protective equipment.

We've had some difficult situations since this month.
In the face of the COVID-19 outbreak, we clearly felt the fate of all mankind and recognized our responsibility to each other.
We face unprecedented challenges, but we know that the best measures to address this challenge require people around the world to share, work together and promote community building, which is the core idea of Wikimedia.
The transmission of friendship and care between all colleagues via e-mail, telephone and chats is a good proof of the extraordinaryness of our colleagues, and how we are fortunate to work with you.
I'm grateful and proud to be colleagues.
Last week, someone expressed appreciation for our work.
They made me realize how meaningful the world can use Wikipedia at this moment, and it makes me realize that this critical resource remains the symbolic power of the world to keep its functioning properly.
Whether your job is responsible for website operations, pay payments or community security, Wikimedia's normal operation is not without your hard work.
The world now needs Wikipedia more information than ever.
At this stage, our work and even the way we work will have a major impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and the heavy responsibility of colleagues, we will make some important adjustments to our collaboration from next week.
Adjustments to working modalities and timetables
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the executive team met last night to discuss the way and schedule the company works in the next few days to months.
At the meeting, we considered the appropriate response we consider to address the current challenges facing companies and best practices to ensure that companies maintain sustainable development during the epidemic.
The executive team agreed to ease the pressure on the company's employees so that you can support the company's mission for a long time.
We support your proper work stress.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours per day (or 20 hours a week), and subsequent changes will be notified.
If you can work longer a day, we'll arrange a mission for you for a long time.
But given the unpredictable nature of the current world situation, we will give priority to your personal needs, such as family care, shopping or medical visits.
We're not following your working hours.
If you're sick, please put down your job.
It's self-evident, but we'd like to remind you, don't worry.
You do not have to take sick or paid leave, but you need to inform the manager and help your team modify the work calendar and schedule to ensure that critical areas of work are not affected.
(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please inform Bryan of the talent and cultural operations that the department will provide you with support and ensure that your situation is properly paid by management.)
For hourly employees, we'll pay in full.
We have expressed our commitment to the contractors and hourly colleagues again.
The pay we pay everyone will continue to be calculated on the basis of the remuneration they receive to complete normal working hours under normal circumstances.
Even if you're sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people choose to communicate with the outside world through their work and release their pressure.
Our work can bring incredible returns, especially in times like this.
But taking care of yourself is still first.
We ask you to keep your communication with the manager so that we can get your latest information and make adjustments accordingly.
Prioritize important work.
We have to keep some important work running.
The website reliability engineering team, the human resources operations team, the trust and security team and the fund-raising team (and other teams) are essential, which may require additional support.
We will begin to assess the current objectives with all sectors and shift our focus to support matters that are essential to our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, but we all need to focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down will not affect future developments.
We're not going to "work overtime" after the outbreak.
We're not gonna ask you to work overtime to catch up, because it doesn't seem practical now.
We accept that the current environment has changed, and we will set new goals and schedules as appropriate.
What will be the change in the APP?
To adapt to the new reality and daily working hours requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule for the 2020-2021 plan.
We would like to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan in exchange for more time for budgeting, enabling staff to prioritize critical work and take care of themselves and their families; at the same time, to adjust work arrangements for those who need or wish to reduce their workload in the coming weeks.
The extension schedule can significantly reduce the current planned workload of the organization as a whole and reduce working pressure.
We will make the above proposal to the Board next week. If the proposal is adopted, we will update the follow-up arrangements to delegates and teams as soon as possible.
Thank you for the leadership of the APP team in the process.
Office status, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we learned that a colleague from San Francisco office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
But for the sake of caution, we hired some anti-virus cleaners to completely disinfect San Francisco office.
They use hospital-level disinfection solutions to disinfect the surfaces and the halls and elevator rooms that lead to our floors.
The office building is meeting its obligations agreement and uses the corresponding product to ensure the safety of tenants.
We believe that when you decide to return to work, the office is ready to meet you.
Our Washington Office in Washington, D.C. uses the WeWork office, and WeWork shares COVID-19 agreements with us and all Washington staff.
As of last week, Washington, D.C. had been converted to a full-time remote office in accordance with the guidance we shared with the San Francisco office.
At the same time, as some New York offices colleagues already know, we've been discussing issues related to the rental of offices in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue, but may be postponed.
Some colleagues first contacted remote office.
Other long-term remote office colleagues wish to provide some suggestions for the adaptation of the working modalities:
The meeting time should be kept in one or two hours.
For longer, please consider spreading the content of the meeting to multiple dates.
Clear identification of the objectives of the meeting, setting the agenda of the meeting and sending reading materials in advance.
Videoconferencing as a default mode of meeting, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom for online collaboration and communication.
In each meeting, one host was arranged to host the meeting, and one person was responsible for monitoring questions in the chat window and following changes in the list of speakers and arranged for another person (or in multi-person collaboration) to help record meetings.
If you need comfortable headphones, please send an e-mail to the technical support department.
Use your health allowance to buy snacks.
Add .remoties to the Slack channel to discuss distributed work with colleagues
The Human Resources Operations Team is studying anthropo-engineering guidance in the form of web-based seminars to help all its colleagues improve their efficiency during distributed office.
Last week, we asked all community recipients to cancel public activities funded by Wikimedia before WHO announced the outbreak.
These requirements for cancellation of activities and other restrictions may result in the failure of these community recipients to complete their original contribution activities, and we have informed them that we understand this and that no one of them will be punished for delaying or changing these goals.
In the next week, we will continue to provide more guidance at Wikimania and other regional community meetings and thematic community meetings.
The global community seems to be in the grief caused by the destruction of the epidemic, but it also reflects the comfort of its communities, Wikimedia and others clearly.
In the future, the CRT team will create a page on Meta-Hiki to provide the community with a space to monitor influence and track community communication with us.
Keep in touch and communicate with COVID-19 related issues
We plan to hold a special staff meeting at 14:00 next Thursday at 14:00 (Pacific Time), and we will send an invitation to your calendar later.
At the meeting, we'll share some updates, answer your questions and leave some time for discussion.
We're united and we're here to help you.
At the same time, you can learn more on Office Wiki about the information mentioned in this email and other important information related to COVID-19.
The CRT team will update these pages in time and concentrate all information in one place.
We are trying to maintain regular communication with employees living in countries/areas currently severely affected by the epidemic.
If you have any questions about travel, activities, major workflows or insurance, or need other assistance, please contact and work with the CRT team at any time.
We're here to give you the support and contact you need.
If you have a secret or sensitive issue, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judan, head of the Global Human Resources Operations Department.
Although we face these changes, we cannot give up our work and obligations.
Instead, the epidemic has made us aware that we may need to adjust our work and obligations in a way that has never been before.
We believe that these measures are necessary to support each other's continued work, provide the support needed for our actions and continue to bring the services they depend on to the world.
You're always planning, you can't be afraid of challenges.
Now, please support each other to create space for important work for the next few weeks or even months.
We need everyone to contribute to this goal, so please take care of yourself and family to keep it as best as you need it.
Finally, remember to wash your hands and don't touch your face.
Katherine, the CRT team (Ada K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) with other members of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin-conversion Enzyme 2, ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of the cell (cell membrane) attached to lungs, artery, heart, kidney and intestinal tract.
ACE2 is expected to become a drug target for cardiovascular disease treatment by reducing the content of angiotensin-conversion Enzyme, ACE by reducing the levels of angioxin II and increasing the content of Ang (1-7). ACE2 is also the entry point for some coronary viruses into cells.
The human source version of this enzyme is usually called hACE2.
Angiosis conversion enzyme 2 is a zinc metal enzyme on the surface of the inner skin cells and other cells.
ACE2 Protein contains a N-end platinum enzyme M2 structural domain and a C-end Collerin kidney amino acid trans-shipment protein structure area.
ACE2 is a single I membrane protein whose enzyme active structure is exposed to the surface of the lung and other tissue cells.
Another enzyme called Sheddase releases the ACE2 extra-cell structure from the trans-film structure domain, producing soluble proteins into blood and eventually excretion to urine.
ACE2 exists in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the membrane, mainly the lung type II lung bubble cells, the intestine skin cells of the small intestines, the artery of most organs and the artery smooth muscle cells.
The ACE2 mRNA expression was also found in the cortex, texture, lower and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to balance ACE.
ACE deciphers angiline tension I to angiline constriction activity II.
ACE2 Then cracked blood vessels II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolytic to angiological stress (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also crack many other beryllium, including deprecision amino acid 9 slow-heavy, apelin, neuropressure, morphine A and stomach hunger.
ACE2 can also regulate the membrane transport of neutral amino acid trans-shipment protein SLC6A19 and is related to Hartnup.
As a trans-film protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for certain coronary viruses into cells, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus leading to COVID-19).
More specifically, the S1 sting protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 is combined with the enzyme structure of ACE2 on the surface of the cell, leading to internal swallowing and moving viruses and enzymes into the inner inner body of the cell.
This entry process also requires host silk amino acid protein enzyme TMPRSS2 to trigger the activation of S protein, and is currently studying whether the inhibition of the process can be used as a potential treatment. Some speculate that reducing the level of ACE2 in cells may help to combat infection.
However, several professional associations and regulators suggested that standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy continue.
A systematic evaluation and analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitor can significantly reduce the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group."
And, "for patients with higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with heart failure, using ACE inhibitor treatment also reduces the risk of pneumonia.
The use of ACE inhibitor is also related to a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, but the result is as reliable as reducing the overall risk of pneumonia ... "
The recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a new way to treat acute lung damage, which seems to improve the acute respiratory distress syndrome indicators and blood oxygen saturation in fat sugar.
RhACE2 half-life in humans is about 10 hours, 30 minutes effective and 24 hours (long duration).
Some studies have shown that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients who are not resistant to the classic kidney-angiotensin system, RAS or diseases with high levels of circulator II. RhACE2 may be a promising drug. RhACE2 has been evaluated by clinical trials for acute respiratory distress syndrome.
b'COVID-19 application is a mobile software designed to respond to the 2019-20 coronary virus epidemic, helping to track close contact and identify individuals who may have been exposed to infected persons ( "contacts".
Some regions and jurisdictions have developed or proposed many applications with the support of official governments.
Many frameworks for building close contact tracking applications have been established.
Privacy issues have also attracted a wide range of concerns, especially some systems that need to track the geographical location of application users.
Low-intrusive alternatives include the use of bluetooth signals to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that this function of supporting bluetooth applications would be directly integrated into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government and the payment treasure jointly developed an application to support citizens in their own examination of access to COVID-19 patients.
The program is currently used in over 200 cities in China. Singapore has launched an application called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by the local IT community as an open source software and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a bluetooth-based application called StopKorona! to track exposure to potential infected people and help medical institutions respond quickly.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications Technology and the Ministry of Health of Northern Macedonia.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was awaiting approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the Government announced that close contact tracking applications were in advanced stages of development and will be operational in the coming weeks. Ireland and France are planning to launch similar applications ( "StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering developing similar applications based on Singapore ' s TraceTogether application and BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geographical fence application for confirmed patients living in Moscow to ensure that patients do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering, Cambridge University, listed some practical problems that might exist in the application system, including false positive misreporting, and that there may be a lack of effectiveness if only a small number of people use the application.
To eliminate the spread of misleading or harmful coronary virus applications, apples set restrictions on the type of organization that can publish coronary virus-related applications in Apple Applications, i.e., limited to "official" or other well-known organizations.
Google and Amazon have similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders claim to be concerned about the use of coronary virus applications for large-scale surveillance, especially after the outbreak threat has been eliminated, whether surveillance infrastructure built to respond to coronary virus epidemics should be dismantled.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such surveillance.
These organizations announced eight conditions to be met for government projects:
Surveillance must be "legal, necessary and symmetric";
Monitoring and surveillance expansion must have a "sundown" clause;
Data collected are limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymous information must be protected and there is evidence that it is actually protected;
Digital surveillance must avoid increasing discrimination and marginalizedness;
Any data sharing with third parties shall be defined legally;
(b) The need to provide safeguards to prevent data abuse and provide citizens with the right to respond to data abuse;
All relevant stakeholders are required to participate effectively, including the participation of public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CC) and Reporter ohne Greenzen (RSF) also issued a verification list.
Google/Apple proposed plans are designed to address continuous surveillance problems and remove them from the equipment operating system once no longer need to be tracked.
Some countries use web-based rather than application location tracking, and users do not need to download applications, while avoiding being followed.
In Israel, web-based tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that can access raw location data may have serious privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to personal location data; many privacy protection systems that use central servers to communicate with each other are now created (see below for more details).
Korea has launched a system that is not based on applications to perform contact tracking tasks.
The system does not use specialized applications, but chooses to collect tracking information from various sources, including mobile devices tracking data and credit card transaction data, and then combine them to send notifications to potential infected persons by text messages.
In addition to using this information to alert potential close contacts, the Government was granted access to location information, as the country made significant adjustments to the privacy law of information after the outbreak of the MERS outbreak.
The public can access this information through many applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, are considering using centralized systems and privacy protection systems simultaneously.
As of 6 April 2020, no details have been published.
As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were studying privacy protection solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth low power (BLE) to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
PEPP-PT is a coordinated programme with centralized and decentralized methods, not a single agreement. Dispersion agreements include decentralized privacy protection adjacent tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact number (TCN, originally known as contact event number, CEN), privacy sensitivity protocols and mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT).
Under these agreements, identified personal data will never leave the equipment, and all matches are on the device.
The MIT Media Laboratory privacy team has been developing the SafePaths platform, which uses privacy protection techniques when collecting and using location or path cross-data.
The platform is based on the development of the White Paper "Appliction of Applications: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic" published in March 2020. Besides, Enigma MPC, a company originally created and dedicated to the development of privacy technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is developing a similar platform called SafeTrace.
SafeTrace uses security hardware technology to support users in sharing sensitive locations and health data with other users and officials without prejudice to data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, some groups jointly established the Global TCN Alliance around the basic same methods and basic overlap agreements aimed at reducing fragmentation information and supporting global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, which is a key to achieving widespread application.

On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which controls the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a close contact tracking program claiming that it combines bluetooth low-capacity technology with privacy protection encryption, which can serve as a protection of privacy.
In addition, they published core technical norms used in the system.
Apple and Google say the system is planned to be launched in three phases:
Launching tools to support the Government in creating official coronary virus tracking applications that protect privacy
To integrate this function directly into iOS and Andre systems, Google and Apple plans to launch the system first through operating system updates, and the epidemic threat will be deleted in the same way, thereby solving follow-up surveillance problems.
b Drug repositioning (also known as drug reuse, reevaluation, reuse or treatment conversion) means the conversion of an approved drug to other uses to treat diseases or medical conditions different from their original research and development purposes.
This is a scientific route currently being conducted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the recovery period plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be used for pharmaceutical use, each with multiple formulations.

Redswell was a drug created and developed by Gilid Science to treat Ebola and Marburg virus infections. Gilid Science then found that Redswell had an in vitro anti-virus activity on multiple silk viruses, pneumonia viruses, side sticky viruses and coronary viruses.
One of the problems with anti-virus treatment is that resistance from mutation can lead to more serious diseases and transmissions.
Some early pre-test studies have shown that Redswell may have a higher drug resistance genetic barrier. There are several clinical trials currently under way, two of which are carried out at Cleveland University Hospital; one for patients with moderate symptoms and the other for patients with more severe symptoms.
There are currently three clinical trials of vitamin C IV injections for patients with severe COVID-19 hospitalization; two placebo control trials (China, Canada) and one non-comparation experiment (Italy).

b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine for 2019 coronary virus diseases (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, many attempts to develop this vaccine are still ongoing.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that no vaccine was expected for this disease virus SARS-CoV-2 in 18 months.
In April, five candidate vaccines entered the I phase safety study.
COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
In 2020, a massive epidemic spread globally, causing a large number of investment and research activities in the development of vaccines.
Many organizations are using the released virus genome to develop possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
CEPI presented a vaccine development plan in April and stated that the urgent need was speed, productive capacity, large-scale deployment and global accessibility.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that in early 2020, 10 different technology platforms were studying and developing effective COVID-19 vaccines.
The main platform targets for entering the I-phase security study include:
Nucleic acid (DN and RNA) (I-phase developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus carrier (I-stage developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 gland virus carrier)
CEPI scientists reported in April that a total of 115 candidate vaccines were in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been identified as ongoing projects (79 according to the Milken Institute data), 37 have been announced, but almost no public information (presumption is planned or designed).
The I-II test conducts initial safety and immunogen tests, usually random, placebo contrast multi-point tests, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including control groups and testing the effectiveness of vaccine prevention diseases while monitoring adverse effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines that were actively developed (as of early April 2020), 74 had not yet conducted human evaluation (which is still in pre-clinical study).

CEPI Other investment partners in COVID-19 vaccine development include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started testing six different candidate vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial Institute of Technology in London announced on March 20, 2020 that a self-enhanced RNA vaccine was being developed for COVID-19.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days after receiving the virus sequence released by China.
In late March, the Government of Canada announced an allocation of $275 million to finance 96 medical response research projects for COVID-19, including numerous candidate vaccines from Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Government of Canada announced a $192 million dedicated to the development of COVID-19 vaccines and plans to establish a national vaccine bank, including several new vaccines, so that these vaccines could be put into use when the coronary virus broke out again.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported a test of PittCoVacc, a COVID-19 vaccine that could be used in mice and called "SARS-CoV-2 S1 sub-unit vaccines provided by MNA allow [rats] to produce a strong antigen-specific antibodies reaction, which began to appear in two weeks after immunization."

In March 2020, the United States Government, industry and three universities focused their resources and combined cloud computing resources from Hewlett-Packard, Amazon, Microsoft and Google to access IBM supercomputers.
Some vaccines have alien effects, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that, in addition to disease prevention, they can bring other benefits.
Further random experiments in Australia are recruiting 4,170 health personnel.
Vaccines under development may be unsafe or invalid.
Early studies in assessing vaccine effectiveness using COVID-19 specific animal models such as ACE2 genetically modified mice, other experimental animals and non-human primates have shown that early studies of vaccine effectiveness require biosafety measures at level 3 for treatment of living viruses and international coordination to ensure compliance with standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines for SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there were no SARS treatments or preventive vaccines for human safety and effectiveness.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, new vaccines and drugs for SARS were identified and developed as a priority for Governments and public health institutions in the world. In addition, there are no effective vaccines for MERS.
In the MERS epidemic, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide useful templates for the development of vaccines and therapy for MERS-CoV infections.
As of March 2020, one (based on DNA) MERS vaccine had completed the I-stage clinical trial and three other vaccines were under development, all of which were virus carriers vaccine, two of which were gland virus carriers vaccine (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), one MVA carrier vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media articles have contributed to conspiracy theory, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 has been found and that vaccines are available.
Patents cited in various social media articles refer to existing patents on other coronary viruses (e.g. SARS coronary virus) toxic genetic sequences and vaccines.
2019 Coronary virus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include heat, cough and air.
Other symptoms may include weak strength, muscle acid pain, diarrhoea, swallow pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The insulation period from exposure to the disease varies from 2-14 days, usually around five days.
Although most cases have minor symptoms, some of them develop into viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, the total number of cases reported in 210 countries and territories worldwide exceeded 2.24 million, with more than 153,000 deaths.
There are currently over 568,000 people who are treated. The virus is transmitted mainly through close contact between people, often spread by cough, sneeze or talking.
Although exhales produce foam, the foam usually falls on the surface of the ground or on the surface of various objects does not cause long-range transmission.
Besides, if someone touches the surface contaminated with the virus, then they touch their noses and noses, they can also be infected.
The virus can survive on the surface of the object for up to 72 hours.
Although the pre- and post-rehabilitation may also spread, the most contagious three days before the outbreak. Standard diagnostic method is to conduct real-time retrograde polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests for nose-swipe.
It is recommended that the suspected virus infected persons and their nursing staff wear masks.
There are different recommendations for public masks, and some authorities are opposed to wearing masks, while others require masks.
There are no COVID-19 vaccine or special effects antivirus treatment.
Most of the six WHO regions have reported local transmission of the disease.
The virus may have no symptoms or suspected influenza symptoms, such as heat, cough, weakness and gas.
Emergency symptoms include respiratory difficulties, continuous chest pains or chest suffocation, vague consciousness, difficulty of sobering and blue face or lips; if these symptoms occur, medical treatment is recommended immediately.
A few cases may be accompanied by upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneeze, snot or throat pain.
It also monitors different rates of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as disgusting, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Some of the cases in China had only chest and heart attack symptoms at the beginning.
Some cases may develop into virus pneumonia, multi-organ failure, or even cause death.
We call it a time of insulation.
COVID-19 is usually 5-6 days, but may be extended to 2-14 days.
97.5% of infected persons have symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. The report indicates that not all infected persons have symptoms.
The role of non-symmetrically infected persons in the spread of the epidemic is not yet fully clear; however, preliminary evidence suggests that persons with no symptoms may contribute to the spread of disease.
The Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of confirmed cases did not show any symptoms during hospital.
The National Health Commission of China has included symptoms in daily briefings since 1 April; 130 of the 166 infected persons on that day (78 per cent) were tested without symptoms.
The saliva and saliva can carry a lot of viruses.
Speak louder than normal talk.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered coughs could lead to a maximum spread of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although such viruses are generally not transmitted through air, the National Academy of Sciences of the United States has determined that it may be transmitted through bioaerosol, and air collectors in the outer corridor of the ward detects a positive sample of the virus RNA positive.
Medical procedures such as intubation and CPR may fog the respiratory soil, thus causing air transmission.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through excreta, but the risk is considered to be lower. When patients have symptoms, the virus is most contagious; although the symptoms may be transmitted before symptoms occur, the risk is lower.
The European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) states that while the new coronary virus is not yet fully known, one person generally transmits 2-3 people. The virus survives from hours to days on the surface of the object.
Specifically, the new coronary virus is known to survive one day on cardboard, and can survive for up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and can survive for up to four hours on 99% of pure copper products.
However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature.
If used correctly, soap and cleaning agents can also have the effect of killing viruses. Soap products can degradable virus fat protection layers, which are deactive, while removing the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as phenylzachlor and chlorohed glucose acid (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. A study in Hong Kong, China, shows that saliva samples are collected on average two days after admission.
The first sample of 5/6 had the highest virus load, and 1/6 patients detected the highest virus load the next day.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus, first separated from three pneumonia patients with acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are presented in the relevant coronary virus of nature.
Before the virus is not in the body, it can be killed with domestic soap because soap can destroy the virus's protective cyst. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lung is the most affected organ by COVID-19, because the virus enters the host cell through anvascular stress conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has the highest content in lung type II lung bubble cells.
The virus is combined with ACE2 through a special surface sugar protein called "Stabbing."
Of the patients treated in Wuhan, China, 12% of the infected people found acute myocardial damage and a higher proportion of patients with severe illness.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms due to the deterioration of the disease can also be associated with the ACE2 receptor of the heart.
ACE2 receptor is highly expressed in the heart and is involved in the regulation of heart function.
According to the information received, COVID-19 infected people under ICU custody (31%) and the blood embolism (25%) have a high incidence, which may be related to pre-pre-deficit bad. COVID-19 autopsy found a vagrant lung bubble damage (DAD), and see lymphoma in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 is a hobby for the respiratory skin cells that express ACE2, COVID-19 severe patients have over-inflammation reactions to the body.
In particular, the disease in COVID-19 patients is associated with the collection of inflammation IL-6 mononuclear cells and severe lung pathology.
The autopsy report also saw lymphoma soaking.
WHO has published several disease detection programs.
The standard test method is to use real-time reverse polymer enzyme chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually tested for respiratory samples obtained through nose swabs; however, a sample of nose swabs or slurry can also be used.
Normally, results are available in hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be conducted, but two blood samples are required to be collected at two weeks, with little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to separate the coronary virus strain and publish genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop a polymer enzyme chain reaction (PCR) to detect the infection of the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibodies tests (not only can they detect active infections, but also whether individuals have been infected with viruses in the past) are still under development but have not yet been promoted.
According to Chinese experience, the detection accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
On March 21, 2020, the United States FDA approved its first instant diagnostic reagent and was put into operation at the end of that month. The diagnostic guide issued by the University of Wuhan Central South Hospital proposed methods for testing infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Early infections are mostly seen in double-pulmonary multi-leaf grinding glass, with external asymmetrics and post-part cloths.
As the virus develops, there is a possibility of sub-particle, rock-crawl signs (with different levels of lung bubbles) and lung changes.
There's little information about COVID-19 micropathological damage and pathology.
The main pathology of the autopsy was found as follows:
Meat eye examination: cylinitis, heart-packitis, lung transformation and lung oedema
Four serious levels of viral pneumonia were observed:
Light pneumonia: lung oedema, lung cell growth, large number of atypical lung cells, inter-mass inflammation with lymphoma cells and formation of multi-nuclear megacells
Heavy pneumonia: Vulcan lung bubble damage (DAD) with a bulge lung bubble seepage fluid.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe low oxygen.
Recovery period pneumonia: lung bubble cavity seepage liquid and inter-pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: dispersive blood vessels (DIC); young white-child red cell reaction
To reduce the probability of infection, preventive measures may be taken to stay home; avoid access to dense areas of population; often wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintain good respiratory hygiene; avoid touching eyes, noses or mouths without washing hands.
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that paper towels be covered with paper towels when coughing or sneezing; without a tissue, it is recommended to use the inside of the elbow to cover it.
It's recommended that hand hygiene be properly cleaned after coughing or sneezing.
The core of the social distance strategy is to close schools and workplaces, limiting travel and eliminating large public gatherings in public, thereby reducing the opportunity of infected people to contact large groups.
In addition, the social distance guidelines provide for at least 6 feet (1.8 metres) in relationships.
There is no effective drug to prevent COVID-19. Given that it is expected that vaccines will not be developed until 2021, efforts to reduce the peak of the epidemic are key to controlling COVID-19 transmission, which we know about the "Raping Epidemiological Curve".
Meanwhile, the CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially after dinner and when there are visible stains on their hands, before dinner and snot, cough or sneeze.
In addition, it was suggested that at least 60% alcohol-containing handwashing be used to wash hands, but only when there is no soap and tap water around it. For areas where water-free handwashing fluids cannot be purchased, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
These formulations stimulate antibacterial activity through ethanol or isopropanol.
Using hydrogen peroxide to help eliminate bacteria in alcohol; hydrogen peroxide is not a "hand disinfectant active substance".
Add glycerine as a wetting agent.
Support for sexual care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and other affected vital organ support.
The CDC recommends that suspected virus carriers wear simple masks.
In vitro oxygen (ECMO) has been used to mitigate respiratory failure symptoms, but its benefits remain to be studied.
It is recommended to maintain hygiene and promote healthy lifestyles and eating habits, thereby increasing immunity.
Support sexual therapy may be effective for patients infected with early light diseases. WHO and the National Health Commission of China launched initiatives calling for proper care for patients admitted to the hospital.
American critical pathology experts and lung experts have compiled treatment advice from agencies and provided free of charge through IBCC.
As of April 2020, COVID-19 special effects therapy had not been developed.
For certain symptoms, some medical experts suggested a first-line treatment for the use of aphro-heat pain (acetylaminophenol) instead of Broven.
Preventive measures must be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission and to complete operations that may generate aerosols in a medical environment, such as intubation or hand-to-hand air.
For medical personnel who care for COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends that, in addition to standard preventive measures, exposure to preventive measures and air transmission prevention measures should be transferred to the Air Transmission Infectious Diseases Separation Room (AIIR). CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment during the epidemic.
Recommended equipment: PPE protective clothing, respirator or mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If possible, it is best to use respirators (not masks).
N95 masks are authorized for use in industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized the use of such masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
It is used primarily to prevent the inhalation of suspended particles (e.g. dust), but it is not effective for other uses to ensure effective isolation of specific biological agents.
If there's no mask, the CDC recommends the use of a mask, and if necessary, you can wear a homemade mask.
Most COVID-19 cases have less symptoms and do not need to use mechanical ventilation or other options, but a percentage of cases require such measures.
Medical personnel are actively conducting research to provide respiratory support for COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure symptoms. There is evidence that high-flow oxygen treatment or double-phase airways can avoid intubation.
It is not clear whether the two treatments can have the same effect on patients with severe illness.
If the conditions permit, some doctors tend to use mechanical air, because this technology also limits the spread of aerosol particles. Serious cases are dominated by older persons (60 years of age, especially older persons over 80 years of age).
Inadequate per capita beds in many developed countries, given medical conditions constraints, the health system cannot cope with the serious situation in need of admission due to the surge in COVID-19 cases.
A Chinese study found that 5% of patients were sent to intensive care, 2.3% of patients needed mechanical air and 1.4% of patients would die.
About 30% of COVID-19 patients in China were eventually sent to the ICU.
With the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, the complexity of mechanical ventilation has increased and oxygen is becoming more difficult.
The use of a respirator that supports pressure control patterns and high PEEPs will be used to maximize the delivery of oxygen while reducing the risk of lung damage and the chest caused by the respirator.
Old breathing machines may not be able to achieve high.
Since January 2020, research on potential therapy has been studied, and several anti-virus drugs have now entered clinical trials.
Redswell seems to be the most promising drug at this time.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several drugs tested have either been approved for other purposes or have entered the advanced testing phase.
Persons with severe illness can try to use antivirus drugs.
WHO calls on a wide range of volunteers to participate in potential therapy effectiveness and safety tests. FDA has temporarily authorized the recovery of plasma transfusions as experimental treatment to treat people with severe life-threatening diseases.
There is no necessary clinical study to demonstrate whether the treatment is safe and effective in treating the disease.
In February 2020, China released a mobile application to contain the outbreak.
Users need to enter their names and ID numbers as required.
This application can determine the risk of potential infection by monitoring data detection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
Once potential risks are detected, the application not only recommends self-separation, but also alerts local health officials. Integrated use of mobile data analysis, facial recognition techniques, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence, tracking infected persons and their contacts in Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government approved security agencies to track mobile phone data for suspected coronary virus carriers.
The purpose of this measure is to enforce isolation and protect groups that may be exposed to infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, German telecommunications shared a summary of mobile phone location data with the German federal government agency Robert Koh Institute to study and prevent the spread of viruses.
Russia deploys facial recognition techniques to detect persons who violate the quarantine regulations.
According to Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera, mobile phone operators data show that "4% of citizens are still moving around."
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hacker marathon, with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronary viruses on a global scale.
Segregation, travel restrictions, treatment of side effects or fear of infection, all of which may be disturbing.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connell, "Social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic instability are perfect storms that harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease is more moderate, with little symptoms or even symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as common cold.
Light cases usually recover within two weeks, while cases of severe or severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
According to other similar viruses (e.g. SARS and MERS), pregnant women are at high risk of developing into COVID-19 patients, but lack COVID-19 data support. COVID-19 may have an impact on some people's lungs, thereby causing pneumonia.
In the most affected areas, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which leads to respiratory failure, blood-deficit shock or multi-organ failure.
COVID-19-related complications include haemorrhage, coagulation anomalies, and heart, kidney and liver damage.
Six percent of COVID-19 patients have a coagulation anomaly, especially the time of the coagulator, while 4% of the patients in the group have kidney function anomalies.
About 20-30% COVID-19 patients have increased liver enzymes.
According to the same report, the average time from disease to death was 10 days, with an average hospital time of five days.
But the average time for patients transferred to the ICU to death was seven days.
Early case studies found that the average time from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total time range of 6 to 41 days.
A study by the National Health Council of China (NHC) found that male mortality rate was 2.8 per cent and female mortality rate 1.7%.
The autopsy lung sample tissue pathology tests show that both lungs have a hyperpulmonary bubble damage with cell fibre glue samples.
Lung cells observe virus cell disease.
Lung images are similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, 11.8% of deaths caused heart damage due to an increase in calcium protein levels or heart arrest.
According to data released in March in the United States, 89% of the patients admitted to hospital have a history of past illness, the supply of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region may also affect mortality.
The estimated results of disease mortality vary depending on regional differences and methodological difficulties.
Underestimating light cases can lead to overestimate mortality.
But if the death of the case is due to previous infections, it may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
The chances of smokers developing into COVID-19 are 1.4 times higher than non-smokers, and about 2.4 times higher than non-smokers. People are concerned about the long-term legacy of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority of China found that some of the rehabilitation people had dropped their lung activity by 20 to 30%, and lung scans showed damage to organs.
In addition, after recovery, there may be a post-care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not clear whether previous infections would provide effective and long-term immunization for rehabilitation.
According to the behavioural characteristics of other coronary viruses, it is possible to generate immunity, but there are reports that some COVID-19 cases are positive shortly after recovery.
These cases are considered to be continuing to deteriorate, not re-infect.
The virus is considered a natural virus, which originated in animals, through spilling infections.
The actual origin has not yet been determined, but by December 2019, the infection was almost entirely transmitted.
The first 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases published in January 2020 showed that the first date of the disease was 1 December 2019.
The first date of the WHO official publication reported was December 8, 2019.
There are several ways to quantify mortality rates.
These figures vary from region to region, and are affected by population characteristics such as age, quality of health systems, treatment programmes, first outbreak of the outbreak and age, gender and overall health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO designated ICD-10 Emergency Disease Code U07.1 to the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases of infection in the laboratory, and designated U07.2 to clinical or epidemiological diagnostic infections COVID-19 but undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 deaths.
According to John Hopkins University statistics, as of 17 April 2020, the global mortality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR), which reflect the percentage of confirmed deaths, which reflect the percentage of confirmed deaths, which reflect the percentage of the number of deaths of disease as a percentage of the number of infected persons (including confirmed and undiagnod).
These statistics have no time limit and track the whole process of a particular population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies provides information on the number of infected people.
The Italian Epidemic Center Castigliane d'Adda is a small town with only 4,600 people, and 80 people (1.7%) have died of the epidemic.
In Gangelt, the epidemic spreads through various carnivals and even affects young people, but the mortality rate is relatively low, not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified.
Besides, the German medical system is overburdened.
According to blood donors, about 3% of Dutch citizens may have antibodies.
To date, 69 people (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died in COVID-19.
The effects of the epidemic and mortality vary from sex to sex.
Chinese and Italian studies show that men have higher mortality rates than women.
Males aged 50-60 have the highest risk of death, with a similar gender gap in the 90-year-old group.
The mortality rate for men in China is 2.8 per cent and the female mortality rate is 1.7%.
The exact causes of this gender difference are unclear, but may be caused by genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender-based immunology differences, low female smoking rates, men with combined diseases (e.g. hypertension) are lower than female, resulting in higher mortality rates than women.
In Europe, 57% of male infections are as high as 72% of the total number of deaths due to COVID-19.
As of April 2020, the United States Government had not yet tracked gender-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies show that the effects of viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different effects on men and women.
The proportion of female health workers (especially nurses) is high and the chances of exposure to viruses are high.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease as "COVID-19".
The head of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explained this: CO represents "capture", VI for "virus", D for "disease", 19 for the first outbreak of the epidemic (December 31, 2019).
The name was chosen to avoid the reference to specific geographical locations (e.g. China), animal species or populations to meet international naming proposals to prevent stigmatization. The virus that triggered COVID-19 is called the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Besides, WHO uses the COVID-19 virus and the virus that triggers COVID-19 in mass transmission.
The disease and the virus are commonly called the coronary virus.
During the first outbreak of Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were widely called the coronary virus and the Wuhan coronary virus.
In January 2020, WHO recommended that 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases be used as temporary viruses and disease names, based on the 2015 guide on the use of disease and virus names.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity limits in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers have started printing health-care materials, such as nose swabs and respirator components.
For example, an Italian hospital needs a ventilation valve, which cannot deliver components within the required time frame, a local start-up company to conduct reverse works and print out 100 ventilation valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theory of disease, size, prevention, treatment and other aspects of disease, false information and false information were spread rapidly through the Internet.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study didn't find evidence of the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of the disease.
Government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers are actively conducting international research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the Solidarity Experiment to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing Avirus compounds that are most likely to produce therapeutic effects.
There are no vaccines, but agencies are actively developing candidate vaccines at all levels.
As SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells through ACE2 receptors, the previous work results of SARS-CoV need to be used.
People are working on three vaccine strategies.
First, researchers plan to develop a virus vaccine.
The purpose of using such viruses, whether inactive or death viruses, is designed to provoke rapid immune reactions in the new COVID-19.
The second strategy is the development of subunit vaccines, which aims to develop a vaccine that stimulates a sensitive response to certain subunits of the virus.
In SARS-CoV-2 cases, such studies focused on supporting viruses in the ACE2 enzyme receptor S sting protein.
The third strategy is the development of a nucleic acid vaccine (dulg vaccine or RNA vaccine, a new vaccine development technology).
The safety and effectiveness of the above-mentioned strategies must be tested. On March 16, 2020, four Seattle volunteers launched their first vaccine clinical trial.
The vaccine contains a genetic sequence from the reproduction of the virus that causes disease. It has been believed that the enhancement of antibodies dependence may be a major challenge in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there were over 300 clinical trials.
Seven tests completed the assessment and were approved for malaria treatment, including four studies on hydrochlorine or chlorazine.
The conversion of anti-virus drugs accounts for the vast majority of China's research, and nine clinical trials in several countries will be conducted in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and candidate drugs has been initiated. Several existing anti-virus drugs for COVID-19 are currently being assessed, including Redsive, chlorazine and hydrochlorine, Lopinave/Litonave and Lopinave/Litonave combination interferences.
By March 2020, Redswell's efficacy had been initially confirmed.
It was observed that clinical symptoms of patients treated with compassion for Redswell have been reduced.
At this stage, China and Italy are conducting a third clinical trial. In February 2020, China launched a study of chlorazine (formerly used to treat malaria) and achieved preliminary results.
But there were calls for peer review of the study.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommended the use of chlorazine.
But the Wuhan Institute of Virusology suggested one grams a day, while reminding twice the dose that it could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency use authorization for chlorazine and hydrochlorine, but doctors have the right to decide whether to use the two above drugs to treat COVID-19 patients. China's seventh edition also proposed the use of interference, Libavelin or Abidore treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of Libaverin are in vitro inhibiting SARS-CoV-2.
After confirming the low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, further internal research is recommended using Nitronett. Studies show that the original sting protein caused by trans-film protein enzyme 2 (TMPRSS2) is a necessary condition for SARS-CoV-2 interaction with ACE2 receptor into the human body.
Whether or not it is used in conjunction with Archicin, there are serious limitations to the study of chlorazine and hydrochlorine, and the medical community is unable to accept these treatments unless further studied. Ostawe has no in vitro inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and has not yet found a therapeutic effect on COVID-19.
Cell factor storm could be a complications of late treatment for COVID-19 patients.
There is evidence that hydrochlorine may have anti-cell factor storm characteristics. After completing a small study, the National Health Commission of China has put the Toju list against the treatment guide.
After the positive results of the severe patients, Italy is conducting a national level 2 non-random test.
Combined with serum protein blood testing, identifying cell factor storms, designed to contain the development of the disease, which is considered to lead to the death of some infected people.
In 2017, with the support of the review case study, the FDA approved the use of white cell media 6 receptor resistance to treatment of steroids caused by other causes, i.e. CAR T cell therapy.
So far, there has been no random control of evidence that the Toad is resistant to effective treatment.
The extraction of pure enrichment antibodies from the COVID-19 rehabilitation system is currently being studied and injected into people in need of antibodies as passive immunotherapy before the vaccine is successfully developed.
SARS tried this strategy during the outbreak, but the efficacy of the treatment was not certain.
The virus is a mechanism for the expected role of SARS-CoV-2 immune defence.
However, other mechanisms such as antibodies dependent cell toxicity and/or devouring can achieve the same effect.
Other forms of passive antibodies are being developed, such as the use of artificial monoclon antibodies.
The serum generation during rehabilitation may increase and facilitate rapid deployment. The serum consists of liquid parts of the blood of the rehabilitation patient, which contains specific antibodies for the virus.
Coronary virus disease, a closely related syndrome
Dr. Lee Wen-Lang, a hospital doctor in Wuhan City, raised awareness of the spread of the new coronary virus, and then unfortunately caught COVID-19 and died.
