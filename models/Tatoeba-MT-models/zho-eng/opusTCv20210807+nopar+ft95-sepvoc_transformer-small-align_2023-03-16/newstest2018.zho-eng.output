Civil rights groups issued travel warnings against Missouri
As a result of discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the American Association for the Promotion of Colored Populations (NAACP) issued travel warnings to colored people preparing to travel to Missouri.
"NAACP Missouri Travel Advice, which came into force on 28 August 2017, called for a series of suspicious racial incidents in Missouri, all African-American travellers, tourists and Missourins should pay special attention to and take extreme caution when travelling in Missouri, to inform us that "the group ' s statement claims.
NAACP notes that a recent Missouri law has made it more difficult for people to win discriminatory proceedings, and that law enforcement in the state is to some extent against minorities, which have prompted the organization to issue travel warnings.
Violations of civil rights are happening to people.
They were questioned by parking for colour, beaten or killed, "The Kansas City Star, President of NAACP, Missouri.
"We have received many complaints, unprecedented. "
This is the first such warning that the organization has issued in the United States against a state.
The organization quoted the racial defamation of black students at Missouri University and the death of 28-year-old black male Toli Sanders.
Earlier this year, Saunders died suspiciously, and he was run out of fuel while travelling in Missouri and detained by Missouri police without charge of crime.
The consultation also noted that a recent report by the Attorney General's Office of Missouri showed that "the possibility of black drivers in the state being checked by parking is 75% higher than white people."
Chaper said, "The consultation was to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues of what might happen in Missouri."
"People need to be prepared to take bail to Missouri or let their relatives know they travel in the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI Hate Crime Report, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; according to the number of crimes, the state ranked 16th in the country.
Travel warnings are also a response to the new Missouri law, which will make it more difficult to prosecute housing or employment discrimination enterprises.
Previously, the states of the United States passed immigration law enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement services to detain immigration violators, the United States Civil Freedom Union (ACLU) indicated that this would increase the number of racial proceedings and issued travel advice on Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the United States Government against other countries, but recently, advisory groups have taken this approach to certain laws and trends in the United States.
After the "Gold Age" that increased in the box office in 2015, the overall film market entered a calm period in 2016, and could it be a suspense to break the total ticket office performance of $44,6.9 billion last year.
According to the data published by the National Statistical Office, in October, the price of new and used rooms in Beijing fell double, with a ring increase of only 0.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent.
The current European Union Chief Technical Officer, Lupesku, made a technical report at this conference on the 2016 European Championship and the European Crown League last season.
BBC calls Beijing the most exciting city: making the foreigners feel "Live in a new era."
The news network reported on January 18 that Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is rapidly becoming a modern city of charm today.
The capital of China has an amazing Internet, with cutting-edge technologies such as face recognition software, invested heavily in artificial intelligence and invincible international energy, one of the most exciting cities for foreigners rich in exploration.
According to BBC website, January 16, German alien Clemens Seth said, "If I succeed there, I'll succeed anywhere." He quotes singer Frank Sinatla to celebrate the New York City lyrics.
Seshi, who was the creative director of the Traveler's Archives magazine, said, "If Sinatra lived to this day, he would probably sing a city like Beijing." He said that living in this city would make you feel like "liveing a new era" always keeping up with the tide.
The home is in England, but Simon Norton, who recently lives in Beijing, published an article on the personal blog site 4Corners7Seas, saying, "It's hard to tell, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it's like and want to witness it."
Reports say that the city's high-quality, high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environments make daily life easier than ever.
From Manila, Andy Penia Fuelt, currently serving as Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Beijing Children website, said, "Beijing is rapidly turning into a cashless society, and the Internet integrates the functions of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions easier."
Reports say that smartphones are only the beginning of Beijing's technological ambition, and facial recognition software is already widespread, and many mobile phone applications use this technology for bank transfers and payments, allowing people into apartments and offices, even to verify the identity of the Internet driver.
Beijing recently announced plans to build an artificial intelligence park at RMB 1.3 billion, where more than 400 businesses will be built, where they will focus on developing various artificial intelligence technologies from biometric to auto-driving cars.
Food is also at the heart of many major festivals in China's calendar years, and participation in these celebrations is promoted by foreigners, and spring festival is the most important social and economic festivals and one of the most vulnerable holidays for foreigners.
Seshi said, "I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for New Year's New Year's, clean up the apartment and the red spring union with New Year's blessing on the home door, and on New Year's Eve, all family members will gather a nice meal and then keep up to midnight, and meet the new year with a bright fire. For foreigners, it is a real opportunity to integrate with friends and family."
Reports say that the number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but Chinese language barriers and the convenience of communication among foreigners are easily an excuse for their incomplete integration into local culture.
Ceci said, "Some foreigners have lived in China for years, but they have little experience with their host country. If your initial attempt to contact the Chinese is not successful, then it is easy to feel easier to get along with other foreigners.
"In these so-called foreign bubbles," foreigners are foreigners who are only mixed among foreigners without touching local people and local culture - translators), foreigners are in their own communities, eating in Western restaurants and only foreigners among friends.
The simplest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin -- it's easier than people might think.
Ceci said, "One or two hours a week in Chinese private teaching or learning entry-level radio dramas should be suitable for everyone's busy schedule."
Even a few classic short sentences will help shopping, order meals at restaurants or in taxis.
Reports say that stubborn air pollution is also a fact in everyday life, but in recent years the government has worked to contain problems.
Residents stressed that it was important to go out to outdoor activities in the often lighter months of pollution, to treat blue sky days as an opportunity to sit in a long-standing alley or explore popular Japanese parks.
Norton says, "Beijing is the Chinese city that can find the most important things below the surface, and you can find great art and music activities, love night life, historical wonders, super-modern commercial areas and ancient alleys."
The report considers that the impact of ageing on human capital growth is becoming increasingly evident, especially in the north-east, with an average annual contribution of -1.28% to human capital growth.
Pan Kung-sung points out that the current risk of cross-border capital flows is manageable and the fundamental factors that support balance of payments remain long-term.
The China New Network, Beijing, December 17th, was opened at the People's University of China on December 17th.
The European Commission accused Google of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to pre-load software such as Google Search and Chrome Browser in April this year, otherwise it would not allow other Google applications.
The European Commission considers this to undermine the interests of consumers and hinders competition.
EU regulators initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
If antimonopoly charges are established, Google faces a maximum of 10 per cent of its global fine, about $7.4 billion.
Google has not yet commented on this immediately.
Google is also facing EU investigations because of its own shopping services in the search results.

A picture of the legal status of bitcoin around the world.
Abstract: In addition to the natural price return of speculation properties, the decline in digital currency in this round has nothing to do with the "crowding" - regulatory risks.
From visual maps, the Eastern countries are more conservative about bitcoin than the West, and the countries that account for the global subject are still watching the legitimacy of digital currency, representing the Black Swan Risk.
* This is from Wall Street, editor Wang Mu. For more wonderful information, please land Wallstreetcn.com, or download Wall Street to the APP.*
With the regulatory storm of major bitcoin markets such as China, Korea and the EU, the global digital currency headed by bitcoin has been bleeding since this week, and the price of bitcoin has fallen by $10,000 on Tuesday and the largest single-day drop in three years.
In addition to the natural price return of speculation properties, the decline in digital currency in this round has nothing to do with the long-standing enemy -- regulatory risks.
At this important point, howMuch.net, a visual big data site, produced a map showing the legitimacy and regulatoryity of bitcoin in countries around the world.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legal market of bitcoin; oranges represent the neutral market, although not yet publicly legalized bitcoin status, but there is no major use restrictions; light pink represents restricted markets, i.e., local governments try to use digital currency through red line policies or regulation; deep pink represents bitcoin as an illegal country; grey is a country that has not yet been commented.
(The above map is from HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15th)
According to the article, as can be seen from the map, the traditional Eastern countries are more conservative about bitcoin than the West.
Russia is the largest country currently defining bitcoin as illegal, and China is one of the largest restricted markets for bitcoin, and India is not yet commenting on bitcoin and has not yet introduced one of the largest countries with policies.
North America and Western Europe are the most accepted areas of bitcoin, the distribution of green blocks.
The views of countries in the Middle East and Latin America on bitcoin are clearly divided, and the distribution of colour blocks in the above-mentioned areas is more mixed.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are legal bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia, etc., and more Latin American countries have not spoken about bitcoin.
The synthesis of the above data shows that 99 countries (or 40 per cent) of the 246 countries worldwide have no restrictions on transactions and use of bitcoin, namely, green and orange areas.
Seven countries (or 3 per cent) are restricted markets (light pink), 10 countries (or 4%) defined bitcoin as illegal (deep pink), 130 countries (or 53 per cent) do not treat digital currency information (grey).
This suggests that countries, which account for the global subject (53%, more than half), are still looking at the legitimacy of digital currency headed by bitcoin, and that the "black swan risk" of bitcoin remains significant, as some of them may eventually make legislative decisions that limit digital currency.
The article states that the new category of digital currency, which is not fully understood by global regulators, may be the main reason why most countries have not yet made statements.
Although the human spirit of bitcoin has grown at an index level since last year does not represent interest in all countries, some countries may fear that local French currency is threatened or that digital currency is being used by criminal organizations.
Wall Street has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news on bitcoin since last week, including China’s online platform and mobile app that has begun to strike off off-site exchanges, and Korea is still considering closing the digital currency exchange, and the EU believes that bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warned investors to "recovered to blood."
Wall Street, the editor-in-chief's selection, "Reading Keys 2018: Global Mother Opens Digital Currency Year?" mentioned that, from any perspective of regulation, acceptance/critical, adopted, 2018 will be the digital currency year of the Global Central Bank.
Large countries like Russia criticized the legal status of bitcoin, which is also to make way for the official distribution of digital currency.
Xinhua Madrid, January 8th, the new aid to Kutinio in Barcelona was first seen in Nokamp.

Now the White House of Trump is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most certain sign of the change of regime is when they started attacking the statue.
So Saddam Hussein of Baghdad Paradise Square was carefully pushed down in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key think tanks of the Trump government, was sure he knew what would happen when he had a strong debate with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
If he does, then a bunch of cruise ship owners and liberal followers will swallow him alive.
But he did attack the meaning of the statue, especially when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was carved on the base seat in 1903.
As Miller condemned Acosta, "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the goddess of Liberty is like the symbol of American freedom to light up the world...
The poem you're talking about, which was later added, not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Actually, Miller was right, but as he said, it's not really about history.
This involves the modern echo of Lazarus's amazing words, and the only country seems to invite not only any old immigrant, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowded people yearn for free breath,/suffering people refuse your crowded beaches."
There is no "suffering man refuses" at a moment when our screen becomes more obnoxious.
Miller didn't do literary reviews, and he made it clear that these people were not welcome in the United States of the Trump era.
This conflict on the meaning of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict with the spirit of the United States.
Lazarus, and her, after her death, had an event to carve her poems on the base, and know that they're participating in a highly political act.
The purpose of the sculpture is to express the link between France and American Republicanism by being a woman of the goddess of Liberty, an ancient classic metaphor.
Lazarus changed that: in her poem, the image of women is no longer abstract, and she's going to speak.
She named herself a very different name: the mother of exile.
The combination of this poem with this painting is a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to American nativeism.
Like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wing people always wanted to change their intentions.
The great speaker Rush Limbaugh, a temporary baptist from Trump, thought in 2010 that liberalism was not inviting anyone, and he is now an early neo-conservatist who brought American wisdom to the stupid world: "The goddess of Liberty is brave.
She meant to bring the torch of freedom from America to the rest of the world.
The torch is not the path of America. "
It's unusual that Limbo was actually moved by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the cognitive angle.
When tired, poor but promising people can see it after a long and often terrible journey, they can see it on the deck.
On the surface, it involves the perspective of those who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives in view of the world.
Her statues convey to them and need the hope and welcome they want to hear.
Of course, that's not what Miller and Trump wanted to admit.
They're not trying to light the road, but to light up hatred from their only source of power.
In 2006, Sacho became the first Chinese to sign a global record with a unique music style.
The World Championship 2017: Neil Black highly praised the Scottish team in the British National Team.
Eilidh Doyle recalled that there were only two Scottishs on the British National Team.
Neil Black, Executive Director of the British Association of Fields and Fields, said that a team of 16 strong Scottishs in the World Championship team would make a great contribution to the National Team.
The number of Scottish field athletes selected for the London Tracks Championship, which opened on Friday, was the highest.
Blake thinks, "Scotland is making extraordinary developments," and British trackmen have to learn from it.
"We accept and try to understand this, and we will stick to it until we succeed " , Blake says.
"I'm talking to someone at the Scottish Sports Academy... and they think it's about what they do.
Scottish trackmen think it's about what they do.
The British Association of Fields and Fields thinks it's about what they do.
Even street people think so.
Whatever it is, it's extremely brilliant. "
Many Scottish trackmen are medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be a leader at 5,000 meters and Mo Farah, and Eilidh Doyle.
"Erid is a little modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible." Blake said.
"Many track athletes, whether they're Scottish or not, or where they live or trained, walk out of the door with pride and effort to walk out of the door.
Allid's natural passion and true feelings are good. "
The Commonwealth Silver Winner, who will be in the fifth World Championship, said that 16 Scottishs in the British National Team, which is "unbelievably."
Previously, the number of Scottish track athletes who participated in the World Championship was up to seven, i.e., the number of contestants obtained in 1983 and 2015.
She's got five British records and two European records in the past year.
She'll be in 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who was in the 1,500-metre project competition, was another Scottish player of interest, before she had a good performance in the season, winning the pre-selections and Olympic anniversarys in the British countries.
Doyle remembered her first World Championship, when the only other Scottish on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was proud that so many of her fellow citizens joined the team, but in some cases would also challenge medals and compete for the finals.
"The special thing about being a captain of the National Team is that it was elected by other members of the National Team. So, knowing your teammates voted for you for extraordinary achievements, and anyway, it was a great honor to me." She added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all Scottish players.
It just shows how far we've gone.
And they're all old trackmen here, and they're about to move towards the goal of winning the stage.
How's my captain's speech?
Well, I think it's great.
I was just looking at this fact that in this case we were very lucky because we held the World Championship at the home.
So it's really important that we grow up with our home support and our return to the Olympic stadium.
I'll get a second chance to compete, and the atmosphere will be amazing. "
In 2016, China had 180,000 employees, an employee cost of 1.21.8 billion, an increase of 21 per cent over the same period.
Block critics on Facebook: If you cannot stand the blame of voters, don't run for public office.
Our father knows the bad media.
The Americans loved Washington, but soon after, the major newspapers began to attack him, from domestic policy to political principles, and none of them were left behind.
He's upset about these criticisms, no doubt.
But he didn't say anything about the critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, "Freedom is denied -- we will be killed in silence and ignorance like lambs."
It reminds me of Larry Hogan, Governor of Maryland, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 posts because they made their views on his Facebook official home page.
The American Civil Freedom League filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff thought the lawsuit was hasty, and online coverage is full of their strong resistance: "Who cares?"
A lot of people say, "It's just Facebook."
But it's important.
This is particularly important because it's people like Hogan.
It's a Republican who's governor in a democratic state, and he's famously popular.
Of the 50 governors in the country, he's second in the best position.
Hogan is not a reactionive impatience.
He's in charge of Maryland, strictly following the rules.
He was also very good at using Facebook as the main way to communicate with voters, and he showed his bald head on the home page for the first time.
So the people who blocked the governor's home page review are completely unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman Amelia Shas defended the governor's actions that she thought that blocking their comments was just a little bit of restraint.
But they over hasty described it as flood beasts or cynical people who have swept the network.
The Washington Post spoke face to face to face with the Hogan shielded.
They're just ordinary people talking to their own leaders: they're teachers, small business owners and priests, not a flood beast.
They're saying that their comments are deep, respected, not dirty.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post calling for Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakhimi Salma Ramani, a lawyer in Boy, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked about hate crimes.
She wrote in the news story review section of the Washington Post, "I politely commented that I was disappointed that he had not responded to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also don't like a group of people commenting on the same subject, because they are directly ignored by some people, considering that they are called people of the crowd, not as citizens of the country's worried people. "
The governor's staff called "intensive garbage information bombing" may be "sustaining" to others.
The Facebook era made it easier to modify a message, just to block a critic or delete a negative comment.
And it's much cleaner than the past, and the same effect has to be done in the past years, and it's necessary to send staff out to collect and burn newspapers with criticism or arrest or silence protesters.
But that's what's happening right now, but at the digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of scolding others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being prosecuted by Twitter users because he blocked them on Twitter.
There was a landmark ruling in Virginia last week, on such issues.
According to District Judge James c. Katharis of Alexander, the Chairman of the Lawden County Supervisory Committee has blocked voters from her Facebook home page in violation of the First Amendment.
The Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin (R), was also visited by the American Civil Freedom League for Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the Internet have similar influence.
The number of news newspapers doubled four times between 1776 and 1800, and someone wrote anonymous letters that criticized his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous flood beasts against him.
People write to the press for serious criticism of Washington's decisions using false names such as Yurikra, Valerius, Belissali, Bogus, etc.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper online project, his office was flooded by petitions and was criticizing his attitude to the British King's Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Treaty with the United States of America.
But he didn't whisper them.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of speech are the foundations of this country.
And the real leader needs to accept that.
The wind in the city is driving people's sensitive nerves.
The limited purchase is a hard bar for many city real estate regulation policies.
In May 2017, Jenan introduced a policy of equal purchase of housing by undergraduate students for six months of continuous social security;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy that would allow university students to settle their homes within three years of graduation and employment permits.
The policy was then added, and the official statement was that "a university student can buy a house below 20 per cent market price";
In July, Chengdu introduced a provision that young people with undergraduate and higher education at field universities could apply for a residence with a diploma.
In addition to this, cities or areas such as Quinshan, Shanghai Port-au-Prince have introduced a policy of "brain introduction" to lower the threshold for the purchase of a house for talent.
Zhang Hong-hwan believes that this is actually the most important point of these real estate policies for the competition of the population, especially talent, and that's what these real estate policies are competitive.
Some even think that means the time for the city to cancel the "limited purchase" is up.

It's amazing to be here.
It's wonderful to play golf here.
Last year's memories emerged, and for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was of particular importance to us.
It was a special memory, and we'll always remember. "
Back to the home race was Gary Al, who was just 50 years old earlier this year and then participated in the European Changqing Tour.
This is the first time he's been in Scotland since the Scottish golf competition in 2013.
The Helensburger said, "There's always more meaning in going home to the country.
You want to do it; but you can feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again. I've been playing golf.
I'm satisfied with the current situation. "

Do something for the people.
So far, in this way, the Shaw Mountain has collected a total of 59,805, of which 3,86 were solved, and the problems under way are being addressed are 1,496.
Our Zhejiang cadres have one thing to say.
Geographical advantage is less than cadres, policy preferences are less than good service, and the dedication of the Red Boat spirit can make us move forward, and this is at the forefront of the reality.
You're brave enough to fight.

Looking for a toilet with a nose, this was the memory of a lot of people in the last century about Chinese toilets.
And it's also integrated into more and more human design.
I'm impressed by a lot of tourists. It's always ventilated in the toilet, and it doesn't smell like shit.
No more noses to find the toilet now.
Not just changing hardware, but software to keep up.

Is this the service of the people because of the uncivilized behavior of others?

On the one hand, promoting savings through civilization and technological innovation on the other.
Public toilets in Jiangsu Nanking, Cebu City, etc.
Three seconds to brush your face and get a toilet paper free of charge, but to get double, it takes another ten minutes.
Avoiding abuse of public resources
Get used to it. Some tourists are really trying to take the paper back, but on the other hand, we have to reflect.
Is there no paper in the next toilet we tourists are going to enter, so that's what we're talking about in the new three-year plan.
We're gonna have to fix this imbalance.
To push the toilet revolution deep, it's about thinking more about what the crowd thinks.
There must be a third bathroom to facilitate family escorting old people, children in the bathroom.
We brought the baby. We're embarrassed to stay in the men's room.
The little girl in the toilet is like you know a little awkward, and that board is so comfortable, and it's easy for us to bring the kids.
People feel civilization while becoming a builder of civilization.
It has been a great success to actively promote the toilet revolution not only to help people stay away from disease, but also to bring economic development to narrow the regional development gap.
This toilet problem is a matter of scope, a social development node.
It's a national civilization project that leads to layout from a national perspective, and then addresses small social problems from different levels of participation.
That's how we fill all our shorts.

Poverty and death in gold, Indonesia
Badtina Dage doesn't use stoves when he cooks.
She doesn't even use pots.
Her cabin is located in Enarotali, the capital of Panai County, Papua, Indonesia, and the housewife usually just puts a potato, which is called "nota" -- directly in the fire.
Half an hour later, the burning potatoes were taken out by a pair of unwashed hands and eaten by wolves.
Djay sat on the mud -- she didn't have furniture, and this is where she does routine household chores, like laundry, laundry water, and she's all from the nearby swamp.
A room without a roof with a bucket, this is the outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she wasn't assigned to the field.
Polygamy is common here.
It's dangerous to work late: most men in the village don't work, and many are drunk, plus there are many soldiers here.
She said, "No one dares walk in the village after 5:00 p.m.."
This is a rare glimpse of daily life in Papua Heights, once a colony of the Netherlands, which was incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, but the referendum was also controversial, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in front of the army that occupied the place.
The movement against Dutch rule is now strongly demanding independence, and the movement against Dutch rule will soon point to the Jakarta government, as the government has imposed high-pressure rule over the region, isolated foreign journalists and defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is far away and empty; it takes 90 minutes to fly from the provincial capital Chayapula to Nabire, and then rent a car for five hours to turn the river down in the stomach.
There's no public transport here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, the cabin is surrounded by bamboo fences, wrinkled iron-skin roofs are all kinds of yellow and brown covers made of rust.
Few Indonesians have come, let alone journalists, and few foreigners.
Before the Christian preacher arrived, Mee Pago Papua believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here.
Djay said, "We're not used to these clothes." She means her beautiful hand-weave headscarfs, dark shirts and bright half skirts.
"We used to cover our bodies with leaves."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and is the highest and lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But this is also Indonesia's Golden County.
Pania County is located in the highlands, about the same size as New Jersey, with 153,000 people. The largest, most profitable gold mine, Glassberg, is only 60 miles from here, owned by Philip McMolan Copper, based in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Philip mined about $3.1 billion in gold and copper mines here.
In addition, Papua has a very rich timber resource, estimated at $78 billion.
But these rich resources are also the source of the Papua tragedy, and Indonesia's powerful military forces have been able to suppress them.
A 2005 survey by The New York Times showed that Philip paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, and $150,000 for one official alone.
Papuas' demands for independence are becoming stronger, threatening the golden master, and they are subjected to cruel treatment.
According to defenders, since 1969, over 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands of people raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass massacres in the Papua tribal highlands of the 1970s have been upgraded to genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
The 2016 report of the Catholic Brisbane General Church, "We will lose everything", includes evidence of the evil of the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture, and other reports that rape and electricity are particularly common - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
According to Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher of Human Rights Watch, "Violence is taking place every day and it is therefore difficult to calculate the number of victims. "
Papua's resources have brought a large number of immigrants outside Indonesia, and oppression began.
83 per cent of the population of 3.5 million in the province are Christians, but Muslim economic migrants have changed their demographic structure from the densely dense Java, Kalimandan, Sumatra, Sumatra, Sulawesi.
The Javan snack stand sells fried chickens and vegetables mixed with peanut butter.
The locals are fighting hard.
The 24-year-old Pania local, Apos Yu, moved to the provincial capital Chaapula to find work, explaining, "The immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market at lower prices than the local Papuans.
This has cost the local Papuan, Mama-mama, their market. "
Indonesian President Zoco Vido (which is often called Zokovy) vowed to address Papua inequality and abuse of authority at his 2014 campaign.
The old carpenter's road to Jakarta's presidential palace was supported by 27 out of all 29 regions — including Pania.
But Papua hasn't changed anything. Today, the locals feel betrayed.
You said, "We've broken our hearts, and in 2014 we voted for Zokovy, hoping he will fulfill our wishes and restore justice."
In fact, just two months after Zokovy took office in October, Pania had the worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, Enarotali sang Christmas hymns before the bonfire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers came on a motorcycle.
The scared kids told them to turn on the headlight.
According to the local priest Avette Tebai, one of the soldiers was disgruntled with them and returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses say these drunk soldiers were chasing the kids with their guns.
And then one of the soldiers shot the kids.
16-year-old Yulianus Yemer was unconscious because he was beaten badly.
A few hours later, the nearby government agency election committee building set fire and the next day the incident upgraded.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They danced the waita dance of the Papua Mee Pago tribe with bows -- running around and imitating birds.
Some protesters started throwing stones at regular military posts.
According to an official document seen in Times, when emotions continue to get excited, soldiers receive orders through internal radios: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot it immediately." But the document was not published to the local media.
56-year-old Jeremias Kayam, the leader of the Enarotali Kego Koto block, felt that he was about to happen in danger, and called for the crowd to calm down and begged them to go home.
But nobody's in the mood to hear him.
He stood on the porch of his colorful cabin and told Times magazine when I turned back, my left wrist was shot suddenly."
Kayam still doesn't know who fired the gun, but he said the bullet came from the soldiers gathered.
He said, "It was crowded, they shot a lot."
According to the cousin of the local Alfius Yul, he witnessed the shooting and saw Alfius Yur get shot three times.
Yuhanes sadly told Times magazine, "I ran over to check his body to see if he was,
I found him dead... and I kissed him."
Chief Inspector Yuji Mende of Papua Police told the press that his subordinates were just "protecting" police stations because the police station was attacked.
In 2015, the Papua police spokesman, Police Commissioner Pgio Sulistio, said, "When someone threatened to kill us, we must defend ourselves.
It's about life and death. "
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and more injured.
The next day, the news about the killing was slowly spreading in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovy gave a very quiet speech in Chaapula, expressed deep sympathy to the victim's family and vowed to address the abuse of authority in Papua history.
He said, "I hope this case will be resolved as soon as possible so that this will never happen again."
In October 2016, Minister of Security Verando said he was going to establish a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuses for the push are almost ringing.
He said, "Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the '90s and early 2000s.
The focus is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but this requires a process ... "
Then on June 5, in Jakarta, Verando went back in his conversation with Times magazine, saying he had no plan to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All will be settled by law."
The United Nations has filed complaints against Verando in 1999 in the bloody independent vote in Timor-Leste, but he said that 11 human rights violations in the Papua region had been resolved, including the Pania incident.
The family of the victims of the Pania incident snuffed these words.
Yuhanes said, "I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed at all."
Years later he said, "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army, afraid of being shot. "
His brother Yukabus also thinks Pania's people are afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
He said, "When the body was buried, the military came to me."
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deyay County, Paniai.
One construction company manager refused to help transport a unconscious man to the hospital, which had been in conflict, one person died and 17 others were injured, among them children.
24-year-old Lavianus Dowood drowned while fishing by the nearby river and died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's field office.
Police say the villagers threw stones at the police, so the police shot a warning.
But riot control forces began shooting at the crowd and one was killed.
29-year-old Doming Valley Buddy told Times that we were all panicking and now afraid they'd get revenge. "He lived near the hospital and saw the wounded get in the hospital in a hurry.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deayai Parliament has called for police to justice and to evacuate riot control forces from the area.
Pania has always been a place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has nurtured the disgruntled people of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, scattered in the central highlands of Pani Ale.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army claiming to protect the rights of Papuans by decentralized attacks and raids to kidnap Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua Movement were born in Pania, including Tadiius Yuji and Daniel Yudas Kogoa.
As a result, thousands of Panias have been arrested by the military under the cover of "maintaining national sovereignty" in recent years and deliberately detained.
Some people never show up again.
In the eyes of Papuans, Pania is a "forgotten tragedy".
Poverty grows disgruntled.
Enarotali's selling rice is so pathetic, and the locals can't afford it.
Bread is far away.
People here grow everything they can eat: mainly potatoes and some fruit and leaves.
Cultivation is a woman's job, and every woman can take care of four or five potatoes.
They usually use most of the harvest writers, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten potatoes worth 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has been driven among local Papuans and new immigrants, and the number of migrants has increased significantly since the opening of the new route to Nabire Airport.
A small amount of work is usually in the hands of better educated and richer immigrants.
Papuans have little money or necessary skills to operate competitive companies.
John Gobai, President of the Paniai Tribal Council, said, "Young people don't want to stay in this village because there's no job or money."
Papua is isolated.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Lonshan were deported from Papua because they were "not in cooperation with the relevant agencies", even if they had rarely been authorized to film.
According to Ferim Kane, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch Asia, Zokovy withdrew the electoral oath of reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
In a statement, he said, "If foreign journalists try to report on Papua and West Papua in the easternmost provinces of Indonesia, they are at new risks: denial of visas and blacklists."
Without media supervision means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua neighbours.
In March, six Pacific countries — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands — requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the "general human rights violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua Movement.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Almanata Nasir, was concerned about the group, and he told Jakarta journalists that " Indonesia is still in a democratic system and media freedom, and therefore evidence of human rights violations is difficult to hide. "
The locals want more foreign governments to pay attention.
According to one source, on May 4, when the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights, Keith Van Bar, led his delegation to Chaapula, the local people broke their silence and cried for freedom. "He also attended the meeting, but asked for anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Zokovy again.
The president of the tribal council, Gobai, said, "Zokovi's intentions are good, but he's surrounded by people who were involved in the Pania shooting."
He wants Zokovy to know that the people of Pania live not only under the threat of greedy army, but also have nothing, and that there is little education in this area and lack of public health care services.
Gobai says the Pania people think they voted for Zokovy as much as any other Papuan is his debt.
He said, "They don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Pania shooting have made their last symbolic resistance: burying a victim's body across from that military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let the perpetrators forget their crimes.
Yucabus bowed his head and said, "My family was killed,
What else can we do?"
Sophia, the top-notch brands are customizing the home industry, and on February 10, 2017, the Chinese SEC approved the initial application for Guangdong Sang-Hong House, Inc., with a small and medium board listing pass, which was just passed by IPO for over 20 days.

According to Reuters, Beijing time 9th, Samsung Electronics released its first auto-driving vehicle component developed with Harman International on Tuesday, and information entertainment solutions, which is an important initiative for the company to enter the electronic market for military vehicles.
Samsung Electronics acquired Haman International about a year ago.
At the Consumer Electronics Exhibition in Las Vegas this week, Samsung released a collision warning, a car-way deviation warning, cruise control camera developed in collaboration with Haman.
Samsung plans to start delivering this year the camera system, which is built on technology such as auto-learning and expansion of machines.
Samsung also showed the digital cockpit, and even if the driver was not the owner, it would make the vehicle more personal, because the system would allow users to download the driver's information from mobile devices and clouds.

The fire swallowed the torch tower in Dubai again.
Friday, there was a fire in a world's highest residential building in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to escape this high-rise building 337 meters, 79 floors.
This is the second fire to sweep the high-rise building in just two years, and happens to be the skyscraper called the torch.
The building has been evacuated and no injuries reported and no cause of the fire has been found.
"We were sleeping, and then we woke up by fire, and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to run down from 50 floors, "A resident named George told Reuters.
According to the civil defence authorities in Dubai, the fire department extinguished the fire around 4 o'clock local time and is cooling the building.
The Government has indicated its efforts to provide shelter for affected persons.
This accident could again raise concerns around the world about the safety of the use of outer wall materials in high-rise buildings.
A survey conducted by the manager of the torch building after a fire in 2015 found that most of the damaged objects were covered by the outer wall for decoration and insulation.
The British police have indicated that they believe that the problem of insulation and overboard systems at the Glenfield Building in London could have caused the rapid spread of fire in June, which caused about 80 deaths.
Williams also suggested that Martha might return, although he had announced his retirement.
On January 9, only one month from the opening of the Pingchang Winter Olympics in Korea, the atmosphere of winter is growing in Korea as the Olympic fire passed from south to north.
Korean public opinion expects this long-lost Korean talks to bring an egg to the countdown of the Ping Chang Winter Olympics for a month.
Last November 1, the Holy Fire of the Ping Chang Winter Olympics arrived in Korea.
The heat of the fire is directly reflected in the sale of tickets to the Ping Chang Winter Olympics.
Just two months ago, the Pingchang Winter Olympic ticket sales rate was only 32 per cent, and the winter Paralympic ticket sales rate was only 4.3%, and the low rate of ticket sales once caused concern about the Pingchang Winter Olympics.
But as Li Hee-fang, Chairman of the Ping Chang Winter Olympic Committee, recently predicted to journalists, "as the winter Olympics pass across Korea, the heat of the Winter Olympics is rising, believing that the sales of tickets will soon improve."
According to Korean media reports, as of January 3, the sale of tickets to the Pingchang Winter Olympics had reached 64 per cent, and the rate of sales of tickets to the Winter Paralympic Games had exceeded 50 per cent.
To encourage foreigners to go to Korea, the Korean Ministry of Justice also announced on 8th day that foreigners visiting Han will stay in Korea for up to 120 days.
The investigation found that more than one fifth of American travellers boarded with prohibited items.
A survey against aircraft passengers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had deliberately or accidentally caught illegal items board through the U.S. Transport Security Service checkpoint, of which at least 6% of them were not deliberately carrying prohibited knives or other bladeds.
Less than 1% of the passengers claimed that they had not been able to travel wrongly with guns, ammunition or explosives.
This investigation against over 1,000 people was conducted by the charter service company Stratos Jet Charterers Inc., and found that young travellers were more likely to ignore the rules.
Of the respondents who tried to deliberately carry TSA prohibited items, 19.7% were millennium generations, compared to less than 15% of the X-generation population.
The most common thing that deliberately slipped through TSA security officers is food and beverages.
Over 3% of the population admitted that they had deliberately carried the blade, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also indicated that they had deliberately carried prohibited drugs on board.
The company claims that the investigation was conducted to understand the number of people who had accidentally carried and deliberately carried the embargo over board.
It's not surprising that the most likely people who have been carrying embargoed security checks -- intentional or unintentionally -- are those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guide is a little complicated and difficult to understand.
People are usually not sure what and how much liquid they can carry.
So it's not surprising that TSA seized most of the illegal liquids.
It was once thought that TSA might also consider books as a embargo.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed to carry.
The US EPA Director Prout changed his mind about the Obama era's emission reduction regulations.
One day after being prosecuted by 15 states, the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Prout changed his early delay in implementing the Obama era to reduce emissions from smoke air pollution.
Prout proposed this change, as the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly to the needs of state institutions for environmental regulation.
He did not mention the legal challenges raised by the Federal Court of Appeal against his former position.
The focus of the dispute is to set the deadline for the start of the 2015 ground ozone standard for the states on October 1.
In June, Prout announced that he would delay his performance for a year in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the program to avoid "interference with local decision-making or hindering economic growth".
Prior to the appointment of President Donald Trump, Prout was the Attorney General of Oklahoma, who has long opposed the strictization of environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Prout has repeatedly stopped or postponed regulations against the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reverse was the latest legal obstacle to the Prout regulatory return agenda.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency was overstepping the implementation of the Obama administration's requirement of oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane spills.
In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Prout proposed a major turn in his attitude towards ozone standards, expressing his commitment to strengthen the Environmental Protection Agency ' s commitment to cooperate with the states and to adopt complex procedures to reach new standards.
Prout said, " Under previous government administration, EPA usually does not meet the specified deadline, and then wait for radical groups and others to prosecute, and then agree to establish the designated timetable by agreement. " He initiated a dozen prosecutions against the Environmental Protection Agency in his previous work.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, we take the deadline seriously.
We also take the regulations and authorities seriously. "
Nevertheless, the EPA statement states that Prout may again use his "extension authorization and all other legally available authorizations" to ensure that the provisions are consistent with "good policies and best available information".
Republicans in Congress are promoting a broad rewriting of ozone-level regulations.
The House of Representatives Act approved last month was designed to postpone the 2015 rule by at least eight years.
This measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.
New York State Attorney Eric Schneiderman led the state union to sue the US EPA this week for its intention to maintain legal pressure.
Schneider says, "The reverse of the US EPA -- after we filed a lawsuit -- is a significant victory for 6.7 million New Yorkers' health and safety, with more than 115 million American communities directly affected by smoke emissions."
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C., joined the New York State, in this case.
Ground ozone is formed by common pollutants from automobiles, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources that react under sunlight exposure in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive populations, causing premature deaths every year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists are cheering for the amazing transformation of Prout.
Lori Ann Bird of the Biodiversity Center said, "It's disturbing that this common sense measure is under enormous pressure from the head of the department that protects the air we need to breathe. "
"We must fight the Trump government's intellectual movement to accommodate polluters and special interests ... "

Since the second half of 2009, the sales of Xiaoshan have remained high, especially this spring, and the sales of the Xiaoshan tree have risen again, with a significant increase in sales and prices, and according to statistics, a 48 per cent increase in tree sales revenues from the same period last year in January to June this year, the largest increase in the number of years.
According to Shihai Yong, Deputy Director of the Xiao Mountain Forestry Agency, with a good sales situation, Xiaoshan Hanaki production has also developed faster.
In the last two years, the area of tree cultivation in Xiaoshan increased by 30,000 acres, with a total area of 180,000 acres; while actively developing outside the region, with the establishment of a flower base of 80,000 acres across the country, an increase of 30,000 acres over 2008.
While the area of cultivation has been increasing, the quality of the nursery has been increasing, the value of the nursery is increasing, large specifications, high quality seedlings, and some of the seedlings are being sold.
Shihai Yong also reminded that, in the face of the current boom, producers should be calm and objectively analysed that both society's demand for flowers would be long-term and growing, while recognizing that market competition would be more intense.
On the morning of Beijing time, Beijing time, Somaltus filed a lawsuit against the Eastern Texas District Court, accusing Apple of violating a battery technology patent it applied for in 2010.
The company has previously sued Hua-seok with the same patent, and I think, Samsung, Sony and Toshie.
The lawsuit states that iPhone 6s and similar apple equipment violated United States patent 7,657,386, known as the Integrated Battery Service System.
The plaintiff wishes to receive cash compensation or charge patent fees for tort equipment after the verdict.
From the indictment, the plaintiff seems to think that iPhone's fast-filling function violated the company's patent.
The iPhone with fast charge will quickly charge the charge to 80%, and then charge the twilight stream.

Moore Beach tragedy: activists re-emerge racist lynching, justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car crossed a group of viewers in Menro, Georgia, heading towards the little Moore Beach Bridge.
The car was carrying four black passengers and a white driver, and before the car arrived at the bridge, a group of white people with guns went in front of the car, blocking the way forward.
The mob's head -- a middle-aged man in a fine striped suit -- sucking a cigar, and his eyes are looking into the windshiel.
The passengers in the car are full of fear.
"We want-- Roger!" The man shouted.
"Towed him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged down from the front row passenger seat and screamed to break the silence.
Fortunately, July 22nd, this terrible scene was just a re-emergence.
But when Roger's neck was covered, almost all the viewers were breathing.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moor Beach Bridge, re-emerging two black couples -- Roger and Dorothy Marcon, and George and Merrey Dossy -- hanged by the three K parties in 1946.
No one's ever been charged with murder.
"We know who they are, although we saw them in the community, none of them have been arrested for years, which is incredible," said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize this re-emergence.
"This is the stain of history, the burden of our soul."
Brooks 71 years old, a former Georgia congressman and a life-guard activist.
For him, it was a remarkable call, reminding the people of the Menro community that injustice has never been corrected every year.
"We want to sue, we have to close the case, we're going to heal, we want to settle, but we must first get justice," he says.
"We will not be cured and reconciled unless we have justice. "
On July 27, 1946, the coroner covered a bed order on the body of a victim of the lynching in Moore Beach.
According to FBI files from the National Broadcasting Corporation news, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties are suspected of being involved in lynching.
But none of them have been prosecuted.
Although suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists have indicated that the dual motivation for lynching is well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the early elections later in the summer.
According to FBI statistics, at about the same time, the black tenant Roger Malcolm stabbed the white landlord Barnett Hearst in a struggle -- looks like a woman.
Brooks said that the town rumor was that Hearst slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and her baby wasn't her husband's either.
The FBI claims that on July 25, 1946, the prominent white landlord Roy Harrison spent $600 on bail out of Malcolm.
Dorothy and cousin McMerry and George Dorsey went to prison with him.
But when they came back from prison to the Moor Beach Bridge, a bunch of lynching thugs surrounded the car.
"It turns out Harrison organized and ordered the murder," a FBI report came to this conclusion.
"It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement agencies who are involved not only in murder, destroying evidence, but also hides the identity of witnesses ... "
Brooks is very simple.
He said, "It's a voting tragedy."
"They were killed, and the killer sent a message to the black people in this community: "If you register and vote, you will end the same."
For almost 10 years, Cassandra Green has been in charge of the annual re-enactment of the Moor Beach Bridge lynching.
She's got a clear image of her performance, and she's got a deep racist background, and many people hope that racism will no longer exist in the United States.
It's hard to see, not to look harder, but Green says that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because lynching makes us face the ugly face of everyone," she says.
"But if you don't listen to me or don't hear me tell me about my experience, I can't have a relationship with you."
This year's show started in June, with nearly 30 actors on the first day -- a dozen whites, the rest black -- squeezed in a room to hear Green's rehearsal overview.
Wade Malbo is co-director of Green.
He's been playing the role of the Klan for years, but he said it was never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Malbo said.
"But I think it's important to keep this history alive, because we don't want to go back to that time."
In the room, the actors who played Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hearst, Darios Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, were rehearsing their lines.
At the beginning of the show, Malcolm shouted and pushed Hearst and was angry at his wife Dorothy.
"I said, get out of my place!"
Rascona's back on the road.
And then they got into a fight.
And then everyone's laughing.
Green smiled the best.
"What's wrong?" Rascona asked.
He's scared, confused.
Did I play too much?
"No," Green smiled.
"I just don't think white people say, "Aah."
"Yes," another black actor plays fun.
"Your tone must be tough."
That's it. The energy in the room has changed; the feeling of friendship drives away from discomfort.
Everyone tried to do it not only to perform this show, but also to commemorate the four victims.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona said the word "aah," it was sharp and powerful.
No one's laughing.
It's over with strength and speed.
Screams, shots, and then, a silence.
A woman in a funeral black dress stood by the actor singing Billy Hallede's condolence word "unusual fruit".
Her voice has been squeezing other words.
A hundred yards away, about 40 people are cleaning sweat and tears.
Black and white are almost half the audience.
A couple of people came to see the show from Isaka, New York, and many people live near the road.
Brooks took them to Malcolm and Dorothy's cemetery for almost eight hours, and everyone was suffering the uncomfortable wet heat of Georgia.
And now, the murderer was still a fan, but now, standing on the same land where lynching occurs, the air is full of anxiety.
When the last note of the song disappeared, Green asked people to approach the body that the actor played.
The kids leaned down, looked at fake blood and bodies, whispering each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mumbling, like they're reminding themselves.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and ended the show.
Actors throw away lynching ropes and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugged Marbau, the man who played the third K party head suit.
Nick Rascona hugged his two colleagues and cried in their arms; the emotions in the show eventually infected him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispered.
"We know you're not like that.
You did it for a reason. "
After that, the audience sat down for dinner with the actor.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta talked to a black couple they just met, talking about re-emergence.
Dennis Duppricki has difficulty finding words that she feels after watching.
"It's hard to imagine those terrible words and behavior... that people like you say it and do it because they look like you," she said.
"It really makes me think that lynching is still going on," she added, "Now this is just a police shooting."
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sat by the table watching, tasted and tasted civil rights.
He said he's already planning a show next year.
"Repeat is an inspiring way because it describes the horrors we've been through, but it's also very educational," he said.
"If you don't learn from it, this could happen again.
Those who don't study, don't know their history are destined to repeat the same. "
The importance of reform of the "net independence" is self-evident for the reform of the market for natural gas, but resistance and controversy are high.
The journalist was informed on 7th from the Hebei Kaijian Group that an explosion occurred at 1125 a.m. in the emulsification workshop of the Kaekung Chemical Company Limited in Tangshan City, Hebei Province, where 13 operators were trapped.
So far, one of the 13 people trapped has been rescued and taken to hospital rescue, and the remaining 12 are under stress.
It is understood that the local public security, fire, medical services are being rescued on site.
According to witnesses, there was a loud noise in the event, and a mushroom cloud came up in a moment.
According to the members of the group that organized the search and rescue on site, Tangshan Kai-chul Chemical Co. Ltd., located in Zhao Zhongxiang, Tangshan City, Hebei Province, is a State-approved production company for civilian blast equipment, which was established in 1958 and formerly known as the 6O2 plant of the Mining Authority.

American media: Chinese Air Force Engineering University scientists studying laser satellites for the removal of space waste
The news network reported on January 18th that Chinese scientists proposed a bold and innovative proposal to clean up the mess of Earth orbits with large lasers, destroying old satellites and their sky trash.
According to the newsweek website of the United States Newsweek, researchers at the China Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled "Scientific Laser Clearing Small Scale Space Fragmentation Model Study", which describes how space debris can be irradiated by lasers by lasers through the use of space-based platform lasers to smaller, less harmful debris.
Reports say that space waste has been a matter of concern to the International Space Agency for years, and NASA has considered a variety of options to track, detect and remove artificial debris.
The way to remove large-scale space debris includes meganets used to clean and collect waste, and magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists have conducted laser simulations to conclude that this will be an effective way to clean the Earth's orbit.
The paper was summarized as follows: " (simulation study) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris removal technology for UN-based platforms ... "
The 2014 study by the United States defense giant Lockheed Martin found that there were about 200 threats per day for satellites operating along orbit.
High-speed debris moving along Earth orbit is considered a serious threat to future space missions, described by the European Space Agency experts as "a deadly series of threats".
Also reported on January 17th, the U.S. Mass Machine website, space is basically empty, but the space close to Earth is becoming more crowded. Every satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris around the Earth, and over time, these pieces will pile up.
The more debris, the higher the chance a satellite that is still functioning is being hit by debris, thus damaged or destroyed an investment worth millions of dollars.
Reports say all space agencies have plans to clear space waste in the future.
NASA is considering reducing the speed of debris with jet gases and getting it out of orbit, and Europe is considering launching a satellite with a large network, capture debris, bringing back to Earth, and Japan's idea is to capture debris with an electric chain.
Now, China has also proposed a solution to space waste, which is to hit floating space waste into less harmful small debris with a large laser.
According to a paper published by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University in Germany, the installation of such lasers on a satellite would be sufficiently effective in cleaning up space, at least according to simulations.
According to the report, the only way to prove effectiveness is to test, and there are no such mission arrangements, but perhaps someone will install lasers on satellites and send them into space.
Once we do it, we can finally start to eliminate the problem of space trash once and for all.

Mikey Garcia and Vasili Lomachenko first met to discuss the possible future duel.
The most remarkable boxing competition under 147 pounds will be held shortly and is currently meeting with Vasili Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia in a possible conflict situation for the first time on Thursday.
They're in the independent room of the ESPN office in Los Angeles, where the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia took the lead down the hallway and saluted the world boxing organization's super-plumn champion Lomachenko.
At the Showtime Boxing on Saturday, the referee agreed that Garcia defeated the four-district world champion Adrian Brona, and that both of them had become the top five players on the heavyweight list.
Garcia reached out to her right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
Good luck. "
In the ESPN game on Saturday night at 7:00, Lomachenko won Miguel Mariaga and saved his position.
When they took pictures, the agent of Lomachenko, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the potential fight between the two players depends on the perfect size.
"I was lightweight," Garciat.
"I'm up to the battle of Bronner, but I'm not that big.
I'm a little short weight than 140 pounds.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he has to reach lightweight, and then we can fight.
That's what fans want.
Then we'll meet them."
Lomachenko agrees.
"The boxing industry needs this fight."
Klimas asked him if he should be charged a second fee, and part of his strategy was to have Lomachenko play a premiere with a 135-pound player later this year, thinking that next summer he had a date with Garcia (37-0,30 knockout). Garcia was also interested in fighting the winner of the battle with Jorge Linares-Luc Campbell after the Forum's lightweight champion on September 23rd.
"Because all fans are asking this question, this fight may be a second-rate charge," said Garcia... and then he was open to the competition on the Internet that offered the best financial options.
"We're the main figures.
No one else can have such a lot of attention.
As long as they're ready..."
Garcia appreciates Lomachenko as a "excellent player" and may be watching his Saturday boxing game.
But Lomachenko hesitated to praise Garcia, saying he thought the three-part champion from Riverside seemed "slow."
Garcia said the point was to show the power of the fist and then boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their boxing.
"This is a battle that must be carried out,
Attention and enthusiasm are beyond the reach of other boxing competitions.
I'd be happy to compete, "Gasiah says.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top warrior, this time it's Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."

The statement of the 11th and 5th emission reduction target was pre-completed by the Chinese Development Commission officials, giving a strong re-production expectation of the steel industry, which was restricted.
Although the steel plant has not received a clear notification of the end of the energy efficiency reduction work by the local government, it is estimated that on 15 December 2010 the steel plants that were originally restricted will complete the re-production, steel prices or pressure will begin.
There is no notice of the end of the limited electricity limit, but in fact the pressure of each enterprise is much less than September, and in October, a private steel company in Hebei Province said to the press.
Some parts of Hebei have repeatedly issued limited electricity-limited documents and once used to force the gate to limit their production.
Journalists learned from local companies that steel factories in most parts of Hebei are now re-worked and limited production pressure relief.
My steel net analyst Zhang Tieshan predicts that the end demand for building steel will gradually be weak by the north due to winter.
The gradual end of energy-saving emission reductions, and by December 15, most steel plants will be largely re-produced and the products will reach local markets by New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put some pressure on the price of steel that is currently rising.

The latest results of the Swedish age assessment test for asylum-seekers are published
The Swedish asylum-seekers test uses the latest method to assess their age physically, and the latest results show that over 80% of the testees are judged to be over 18 years old, but not all believe in their accuracy.
The Swedish National Forensic Center (R?tsmedianalverket) started the test earlier this year.
After being accused of having failed to accurately assess the age of refugees who claimed to be underage, the Swedish Immigration Service (Migrationsverket) designed these tests with a view to conducting more accurate age assessments during asylum.
So far, the Swedish Immigration Service has sent 6880 testers, and the Forensic Centre has now published the results of a total of 2481 testers between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
80% (2002) were convicted as 18 years or older, but in 25 other tests, the Swedish National Forensic Centre found the subject "may be 18 years or older".
In 432 tests, the result was that the man "may be under 18".
The test is only for people with questions about age.
According to John Grantson of the Forensic Center, these results are consistent with the results of the previous months.
He told The Local, "These data are not very different from the data of the previous few months, and the numbers are very consistent."
The higher proportion of cases determined to reach 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that these asylum-seekers lie about age.
In May, the Centre published 581 tests and stated that there were 442 cases "shows that the testee was 18 years old or older".
The news newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results of the 581 tests published and found that 243 of the testees had publicly indicated that they were 18 years old this year.
X-ray tests on intellectual teeth, MRI scans of joints, then analysed by dentists and radiologists, which are also questioned in parts of the region.
One of the suspects is Claude Marcus, an endocrine scientist at Caroline College, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to determine whether they experience adolescence earlier or later than normal age.
He told the news paper Metro, "I have reason to think so, and I don't think it should be.
It's not accurate to determine the physical age in this way.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can do it. "
But Grantson of the Forensic Center defended the accuracy of these tests: "It is generally possible to say that a child is not sure about being an adult. "
The biggest risk is that this man is just under 18 years of age, and this is about 10%.
The Governor of West Virginia announced a change of party.
Thursday night, Jim Justice, Governor of the West Virginia Democratic Party, announced at President Trump's rally that he would change the party.
"I like it, I don't like it. The Democrats have left me." The governor said.
"Today, after I've done a lot of prayers and a lot of thinking, I'm going to tell you today that I can't help you as a Democratic governor anymore. "
The rally broke out and cheered.
"So tomorrow, I'll change the party to the Republicans."
"As a coach, I'm gonna tell you it's time to start another game."
Trump promised to make a major announcement at the Western Virginia rally earlier.
Mr. Trump won 42% of West Virginia's vote, and Jastis didn't support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

At present, he's worth about $15.9 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Council issued a statement on Thursday night saying, "The change of party of Governor Jastis is another blow to the Democrats, but will not prevent our country from becoming great again, but will make our country great again."
"The Democratic Party currently has only 15 governors and controls the lowest number of state councils, and Governor Jastis' statement is the latest rejection of such a party that loses leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive unified slogan " , as Rona Mc Daniel, the woman president of the Republican National Council, stated in a statement to CBS News.

Sebastian Co. praised Russia for his frank apology for the stimulant scandal.
On Thursday, Sebastian Ko, President of the International Federation of Fields and Fields, expressed appreciation for Russia's apology for the stimulant scandal and declared the apology very "tact," but he reiterated that it was not the moment when Russia was re-entering the campaign.
At the International Federation of Fields and Fields Congress, Mitry Chiracdin, President of the Russian Federation of Fields and Fields, stated that his country was right to ban his country from participating in the campaign, and he was determined to fight stimulants.
He said he was sorry, "All the athletes who won gold and silver in the game were deprived of the medals."
Despite his comments, the International Federation of Fields Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban. Previously, the World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) report referred to evidence of the Russian State sponsored use of stimulants, which was imposed in November 2015.
"I think today's response is very frank and frank," the President of the International Federation of Fields told reporters.
"The entire Council and the United Nations Congress are pleased that the Russian Federation has admitted that it has been through a very burning period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia is able to re-enter the competition ... "
Ko said he was happy that Russia accepted the re-election criteria.
"I think it's a very constructive day, and I think we've made some progress, but the UNA Congress supports the Panel's proposal, and it's not time to restore Russian qualifications," says the Section.
"We need to do everything we can to normalize this in the next few months.
Our guiding principles have been the desire to separate innocent athletes from contaminated systems," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes meet the strict standards of the International Federation of Fields and Fields and Fields and Fields, which will be held in London on Friday as neutrals.
Vaughn Anderson, head of the International Federation Task Force, stated on Monday that Russia had not yet met several criteria for restoring the competition.

The RMB intermediate price is 6.4401 depreciated at 66 base points, and the continuous rise is suspended.
Macroeconomics 2018-01-18 09:50 Sharing
On January 18th, the renminbi paid 6.4401 to the United States dollar intermediate price, which depreciated 66 basis points on the previous trading day, ending the previous five-link increase.
The overnight market, the dollar warms up, the dollar index comes out of the V-word form, as of Beijing time 07:30, 90.8900.
The Fed published economic brown books showing that almost all 12 Fed regions reported moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018, and remained optimistic about the prospects for this year.
Meanwhile, unemployment in the United States remained at 4.1 per cent in December, the lowest since 2000, and enterprises are expected to increase their wages in the coming months.
Fed officials generally believe that tax changes are a factor in supporting this moderate economic outlook, and the Fed predicts a 2.5 per cent increase in interest rates in 2018.
Marketers have noted that in recent times, the ECB monetary policy has tightened its expectations to push up the euro exchange rate, the dollar index has declined continuously, and the renminbi has been able to rise rapidly to the United States dollar exchange rate, but it is unlikely that the ECB is unlikely to adjust its policy position quickly, and that the foreign exchange market will eventually return to the basic side, and that the renminbi exchange rate continues to operate steadily as a high probability event.
It is worth noting that as the market is expected to stabilize the renminbi, the attraction of renminbi assets to offshore investors has gradually increased.

What does the financial rules of the football industry have on Neymar's transfer to Paris?
The rules designed to prevent unrestricted spending at the European Haomen Football Club do not prevent Nemar from moving from the Barcelona Club in Spain to the St. Germain Football Club in Paris, France.
The consequences of this are further downgrading of the European Football Associations (UEFA) of St. Germain Football Club in Paris. The European Football Association Alliance is the regulatory body of European football games, and has the right to ban teams from participating in the widely interested European Crown League.
The "FFP Rules" launched by FIFA in 2011 means that the St. Germain Football Club in Paris must eventually prove that Nemar's transfer will receive financial funding without causing huge losses.
The Barcelona Club has paid 22 million euros ($262 million) just to pay the Brazilian player's cancellation, while Nemar's salary will be tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Nemar's transfer to France.
Given that the team's funds come from the rich Qatar ruling family, the St. Germain Football Club in Paris can certainly sign Nemar with cash and include him in other star-gauge teams.
Clubs can spend a lot of money on players, but they have to use legitimate sources of income to make up for the money they spend and make a balance of their related business in football.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules were envisaged by Michel Platini after being elected President of FIFA in 2007.
The former French player believes that for clubs that are in debt to succeed, if banks or all withdraw their support funds, they are actually cheating, putting clubs at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the "rule" focus moved from club debt to club loss monitoring.
This change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich when he bought the Chelsea Club in 2003, to buy a potential club and then spend heavily on improving the team and building a global brand, and now facing a more demanding situation.
In the three-year rule assessment period up to 2018, the club could lose 30 million euros.
Although Abu was devalued by the then President in 2015, the European Union successor, Aleksander Ceferin, was still committed to stopping excessive spending.
"Of course the rules" are not valid, and we will certainly strengthen the future regulations, and Andrew Traverso, who was responsible for the rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although the Paris St. Germain Football Club will pay off Nemar's one-time buy-out terms, it can also be allocated in accordance with accounting purposes within the duration of the contract.
Nemar has signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer fee may be shown in the annual account for the next five years of Euro4.4 million.
The first wave of "rules" sanctions imposed in 2014 led to the harshest sanctions at the St. Germain Football Club in Paris and the Manchester City Club under Abu Dhabi.
The St. Germain Football Club in Paris was sentenced to a fine of Euro6 million (at the rate of $82 million at the then exchange rate), which was reduced to 20 million euros and requested a reduction of the team to 21 in the 2014-15 season, not the normal 25 players.
FIFA is staring at clubs that try to increase their income by connecting to club owners and cheating on financial regulators.
Although Qatari companies can sponsor the St. Germain Football Club in Paris, if the amount of sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market prices, FIFA will not consider it legal income.
This was what happened in 2014, when FIFA ruled that the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsored the St. Germain Football Club in Paris was exaggerated.
It was reported that part of Nemar's income from the St. Germain Football Club in Paris could be paid from the 2022 Qatar World Cup Organizing Committee.
But both St. Germain Football Club in Paris and the Organizing Committee denied that Nemar would be the World Cup ambassador, and that such initiatives were easy for FIFA regulators.
The recent sanctions imposed on the St. Germain Football Club in Paris mean that FIFA will be more vigilant about any attempt to bypass the rules.
According to Thursday's sources, FIFA has not had a prior discussion with the St. Germain Football Club in Paris on the transfer of Nemar.
The above-mentioned persons only contacted the Associated Press in an unnamed capacity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation of the St. Germain Football Club in Paris.
Last published accounts show that the St. Germain Football Club in Paris had a business income of Euro542.4 million in 2015-16, with a profit of over 10 million euros.
The accounts for the previous accounting year have not yet been published.
The St. Germain Football Club in Paris expects Nemar's alliance to bring the Gospel to sponsorship, concession and sales of jerseys.
The club expects to increase the revenue after signing Nemar by at least 30%.
Apparently, seeing the most famous players leaving, the Spanish coalition was deeply angry, trying to block Nemar's move and claimed that the St. Germain Football Club in Paris violated the rules.
Javier Tebas, President of the Western Aces, told the Spanish newspaper AS that "this is a clear example of a "financial stimulant" that clubs and countries are the same," meaning Qatar, which has final ownership of the St. Germain Football Club in Paris.
Arsene Wenger, the head coach of the Arsenal team, has reservations about the attitude of the State-funded club and the West Ja League.
"This is the consequence of ownership, and this has completely changed the entire ecology of football over the past 15 years " , as Wing said on Thursday.
"When the country owns a club, everything happens.
This will make it very difficult to comply with the rules, because for a country there are many different ways or interests to require large players to represent a country."

3D family animation film "Doufu" 25th premiere in Wuhan, director Zou Zhu, "Doufu" animation director Mong Wisdom, film producer, Amy Prize winner Tom Disher, shared the story behind the film creation.
The story of the "Doufu" is based on the traditional Chinese culture of Handai Huainan, who was born in the traditional book "Lao An doing tofu, made for mistake," and tells the story of the master's "Doufu" by a bean that has been hallucinating adult shape, overcomes the difficulties and insists on the dream of the fairy.
Mount Wudang in the city of Hubei is one of the world cultural heritage sites published by the United Nations and the birthplace of the Dow culture and martial arts, known as the "The Greatest Mountain of the World".
Director Zou Zou Zou revealed that he had gone to Wudang Mountain with the main team during the film creation.
He said that the story of Doufu was in the West Han Wudi year, and in the context of Liu An Xian, the owner of the film, "Doufu" was an unexpected adult-shaped bean when Liu An Zhendan was born.
Besides the Wudang Mountain, which is the source of the Dojo culture, Hubei has a deep roots with China's long-standing traditional instrument, the clock.

Through research, scientists have found that there is one of the greatest features of memory, which is its inaccuracy.
The first piece of "Ray Rain" in 1934 was Cao Cao's first piece, a sign of the maturity of modern Chinese drama and the most translated Chinese play into the national language.
Nostalgicly infected market -- "Hala Summer Camp" and Detective Twin Hung.
The story was repeated to miss the age of actors in the '80s and the garbage age of the 1990s (David Wayne and Michael Shuwalt made a sketch of the comedy "National" for MTV); and also a memory of nostalgia itself, a memory of 2001; before that year, many stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Luther had not yet emerged.
As a cultural art, it's a imitation and expression of our permanent memory of our Facebook age.
But as a series, it feels like time is running out.
The first day of the camp is strong, but it's not just because of its ridiculous humor.
The double-use of the core laugh in the play -- middle-aged actors playing a child of their age -- making it a funny part of the past.
Ten years later, adults actually play adults, and emotions are not too deep-rooted, and imitations are even more scattered, including improvising creation of tracking films in the 1990s, such as "The Cradle Hand".
At some point, a character was stuck in an apple notebook, some straight skates and something else in 1991.
Many core stories are the same.
Mr. Honey is now a novelist, but he still hasn't forgotten Katie.
Victor still has a virgin.
There's another conspiracy in the play involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Shuwalt), which was incited by George H. W. Bush.
As always, the best part of this series is interpolation.
It's particularly interesting to see this forever young Mr. Luther, who showed off Matt Dillon's soul patch in the movie "Single noble," and Andy in the former campus giant now feels like a giant.
This is a random moment of madness, which may provide the power of this film, like a seven-year-old series of "Life of Life" until I think it's logical: "Hala Summer Camp: Twenty Years Later," and its last act was to get these Cass to see the premiere of the "Harara Summer Camp".
Meanwhile, the Amazon's Detective Twin-Hong v. different nostalgias: Cold War Renaissance's American Dream, the movie "The Cold City" and even the East-West wrestling image of "GLOW: The Glory Women's Wrestler Alliance".
This comedy, created by Brian Gatwood and Alejandro Tanaka, was pushed on the TV screen by director Reese Thomas: this is a hard-ass comedy film in Romania in the 1980s, telling the story of two Bucharest officials fighting for truth, atheistism and Marx Leninism.
The main role - the hard Grigor and the idealist Ethelf - were played by Florin Piercezi Jr. and Cornelius Ulitch, respectively, whose conversation was played in English by Channing Tatum (also executive producer) and Joseph Gordon Levitte.
It's a wonderful idea.
But it's not just an idea.
Some of them are good visual twilights.
And there are a lot of famous speakers -- including Jenny Slater, Nick Overman, Mahsala Hashbaz Ali and Kolo Sevini -- to make a wonderful voice event.
But Detective Twin Hung is so committed to building a loud and real propaganda comedy -- a killer with a head wearing Reagan mask -- and it usually plays that role.
This six-stage television was slightly dragged and comedy was released not fast or frequent.
The editor of Detective Twin Hung is more stringent, and when Gregor and Essef visited the American Embassy repeatedly, they showed better inciting irony, because two fat wolves swallowed a bunch of burgers in the embassy lobby.

Journalists have recently interviewed the general decline in the benefits of steel, orbital traffic, ships, mechanical manufacturing, etc. in the northeast.
Some experts believe that in the current situation, a new round of North-East industry revitalization is not only related to the national economic recovery, but will also have an impact on the long-term development and international competitiveness of our manufacturing industry, and therefore urgently needs to adjust its transformation.
The general decline in the benefits of enterprises in traditional industries is a significant decline in the production of raw materials industry and heavy machinery, which is the primary expression of the current economic decline in the north-east industry.
In the past, mainly low end, primary products were affected by high impact, but in this economic volatility, the high-end North-East traditional industry and low-end industrial products were affected.
The Saddle Steel Group (Weibo) started with the adjustment of product structures in the previous years, focusing on the development of high-end plates such as container plates, steel tracks, shipboards and civilian household panels, but the sales of these varieties have declined significantly this year, especially by 50 per cent of the sales of the board compared to the same period last year.
The saddle steel shares (Hou Qingshun, Director of Metallurgy, Liaoning Provincial Industrial and Communications Commission, described that metallurgy is the third pillar of Liaoning, producing 60 million tons of steel capacity in the country.
In January-May, the production of crude steel production in Liaoning province was 21.54 million tons, and the national policy encouraged that the production of products needed for projects with a strong construction of local governments was better, with a significant decline in competitive products in the market, and another feature of the northeast manufacturing industry.

The Bank of England will maintain 0.25% interest rate.
The Bank of England will announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged, and the weak economic growth and easing inflation have broken hope.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will continue to be "weak" because it controls interest rates while strengthening family income austerity.
The decision makers of the Bank ' s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain 0.25% interest rates with 6-2 votes, while a few members called for an increase in interest rates even if weak economic growth had weakened the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reduced growth projections for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively, and warned that family income austerity would continue, while inflation will surge to nearly 3 per cent in the fall.
But it indicates that interest rates will need to be increased in the next few years to contain inflation caused by the de-Europeans, while borrowing costs may need to be increased even more than expected in financial markets.
A year ago, a large-scale economic promotion policy was implemented, and members voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce the suspension of regular financing schemes and will provide cheap funds to banks from next February, although the bank claims that according to the scheme, the Bank will currently need an additional Pound15 billion on a basis of Pound115 billion.
In the record of the interest rate decision-making meeting, the Bank of England stated: "In the core projections of MPC, GDP (GDP) remains weak in the near future, as real household income austerity will continue to suppress consumption ... "
With regard to interest rates, the Bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for "a certain monetary policy austerity" to suppress inflation and need to be "more" than the market expects.
The market is currently expected to achieve its first growth in the third quarter of next year, and the second in 2020.
But the line stressed that any increase would be slow and restrained.
The Bank's growth projections are declining this year and next year, compared to 1.9% and 1.7 per cent in May.
The Bank maintains the projections of 1.8% growth in 2018.
The pound rate for the dollar fell, and the euro followed.
Pounds sterling to United States dollar exchange rate fell by 0.5 per cent to 1.31, and 0.4 per cent for the euro, to 1.11.
Before the constant decision-making emerged, the growing increase was expected to be destroyed by recent unoptimistic growth data.
The line says that growth in the third quarter may remain at 0.3 per cent, although it will rise slightly by the end of the year.
The recent inflation report of the Bank of England did not bring them good news, because the Bank of England reported that austerity would become worse before it got better.
And it's called monetary policy "not preventing" the blow to income in the next few years, but wages are expected to recover "large-scale" at the end of the three-year forecast.
Meanwhile, because of the devaluation of the pound, the demand for British commodities has increased significantly, and the economy will be stimulating to offset some of the low consumption.
The year before the decision-making, the shocking EU referendum had caused the pound to fall sharply, with interest rates down to 0.25 per cent in August.
The Bank of England estimates that it may take four years to have a complete impact on prices and the British economy.
Before the line announced its latest interest rate decision, the rising interest rate was not over the sound, as inflation had exacerbated ordinary households that had long been under pressure, while three policymakers called for an increase in interest rates to 0.5% in July.
Inflation returned from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the Bank of England claims that this was expected and that it would rise again in the next few months.
The line claims that the 2% target is already the last line of the weak pound.
Andrew Monterrey, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said, "In view of the recent decline in the interest rate of swap, the mortgage market seems to be becoming more competitive again, as the borrower strongly calls for more business and looks forward to a perfect sentence this year with positive developments.
For those who may be about to close existing transactions, such markets seem particularly favourable, because there are more popular mortgages (many can be free of charge and low interest rates).

The British National Medical Services System (NHS) has a controversial green light on HIV drugs.
After the High Court's dust of drug support for NHS, patients will be able to obtain "changed" HIV prevention treatment from September.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure preventive medicine (PrEP), a drug that could be taken before sexual behaviour has proved to reduce the risk of infection among high-risk populations by about 86%.
It agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal supported the High Court ' s decision last year, which stated that, although NHS claimed that local authorities should finance the drug, NHS was entitled to pay the PrEP costs.
The actions announced on Thursday were called "a major new intervention" by British CEO Simon Stevens, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a "critical moment".
The sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first registered sexual health clinics. More clinics will be joined in October, and then fully implemented in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention drug (PrEP) is a HIV drug taken before sexual activity to reduce HIV risk.
Tests show that the PrEP can significantly reduce the spread of HIV among people at risk.
The PrEP before sex means there's enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
This drug can be taken every day or two hours before sex.
Those eligible for treatment include homosexuals, bisexual men, transsexuals and positive HIV carriers who have not successfully received treatment.
The clinic will determine whether participants who are eligible and agreed to the experiment, including those who are not known as men, women, transsexuals and their sexual partner HIV infection status.
Persons living in England and registered with general practitioners can also register at the sexual health clinic they attend locally.
The plan will cost 10 million pounds, while the NHS England branch signed a contract to purchase these drugs this week after international competitive procurement.
The experiment aims to assess the full potential of the PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how to locate, absorb and implement them on a large sample basis.
Mr. Stevens said, "This major new intervention should complement and strengthen HIV prevention.
This is another milestone in action that deserves progress in addressing the major human health challenges for over 30 years ... "
The British AIDS Trust (NAT) CEO Deborah King said, "This is a critical moment to fight AIDS.
If it does target people in need and at risk, pre-exposure preventive drugs offer the possibility of changing the AIDS epidemic in England.
Starting in September, the high-risk people of HIV will be able to obtain a new tool that can be implemented in England through the NHS-funded experiment, which will bring improvements to many people's lives.
We agree with this announcement. "
The CEO of the Terence Higgins Trust, Ian Greene, said, "The first task is to ensure that the experiment is pushed away quickly throughout the country, and none of the people infected with HIV can fall.
Now we've purchased the PrEP test drugs, and we're ready to protect over 10,000 people at high HIV risk. "
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgeson claims, "After months of delay and government drag, the start of the PrEP's first trial was popular and should be here earlier.
Evidence suggests that as part of our methods to prevent HIV and stop spreading this deadly disease, what changes can this drug bring.
This experiment will give us a greater understanding of the advantages of the PrEP.
It is important that this experiment be launched nationwide as soon as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and help us further end the spread of HIV in society ... "

High-quality life: using attic and smart designs to make the Count's small apartment a large home
Joanne Ray was a banker, and she was very keen to fix the house, and in 2014 she moved from the big house at the Knight Bridge to the Count's small apartment.
This apartment is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne balcony -- Joanne didn't pack his bags and sell it, which is a strong proof of the new design.
"I lived with my ex-boyfriend in a bigger house on the Knight Bridge," Joanne said.
"I was looking for the right house with the offer.
I saw this apartment at the Count's Palace, and its ceiling was high.
I like it. I made an offer that day. "
Since the first time I saw the room, this 1,000 square foot apartment has now been completely renovated.
This apartment was originally a complex single room -- which needed through the kitchen to get to the bedroom -- Joanne wanted to increase storage space and attic to make full use of the ceiling height.
"I want high ceilings, big windows, enough light.
That's what I asked, "She said.
To that end, she hired Elvan Azadi from Duck & Shed Construction and Design Studio (in Notting Hill) to make a home with a 12.5-foot ceiling, a home that is not only a development project, but a place where Joanne lives.
The ceiling is not enough to increase two up and down space, so the challenge of building is to create a high, sufficiently standing attic.
Elvan must think creatively so that he can solve this problem.
"The steel structure is complicated," he explained.
"We must arrange space to show it up and down, and we don't need to shrugg his back.
Not only is it as simple as building a simple platform, but also to start these steels to put them at the right height of achieving functionality ... "
Through this arrangement, Elvan can get two high-body rooms in this space -- a lot of fun elements.
The attic uses a retrouvius brand of retrouvius, which can look over the fascinating area of life.
Gold furniture with mirrors, small silver furniture and Serge Mouille retro-lights laid the whole style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
Put a mirror on both ends of the short corridor, which makes it look longer.
In the kitchen, the splatter with mirrors is like a window to another room.
At the gate, the little grid with mirrors provides Joanne with storage space for the storage of dishes and glassware.
The beautiful living room has a fascinating sense of space that can put the kitchen away when the kitchen is not used.
The folding kitchen is not new.
But the unique thing about this folding kitchen is a garage-style lift door.
"This is about some engineering knowledge," Elvan explained the MDF door to the steel band.
"This is based on the principle of balance, so when you push the door, it's easy to slide."
Because of the clever use of space and storage, Joanne got an extra 16 square meters, a bedroom and an improved layout.
"In the end, you sell the size of the house -- or your property valuation is based on the area of the house," Elvan said.
" Basically, real estate agents will walk into the room and calculate according to the size of the floor ... "
They'll try to increase the land space while using quality materials, which brings luxury to this space.
Elvan said, "You chose the material yourself and helped create emotional ties at home."
"You won't fall in love with the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they won't hold your heart. "
It turns out that standard apartments can shake you with good design and increase extra space.
Actually, you might choose to live like Joanne.

Two brothers are playing $500 million in real estate empires.
Forty years after its Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers fought for over $500 million, one of Victoria's largest real estate empires.
Colin De Lutis, former director and developer of Carlton Football Club, lives in a mansion in the Tukara district, and the three doors are located at his brother Paul's residence, who filed him with the Supreme Court on the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul has been hoping to leave the family business since 2014, but the two brothers have been arguing about the division of assets in the Supreme Court.
The brothers and their mothers own 38 real estates worth over $500 million, which were accumulated since 1973 when the family bought Smith Street, Colinwood District.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually developed into 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold it at $85 million.
The money was then invested in real estate. At present, the De Rutis family's portfolio includes city office buildings, the Brunswick and Sorento development projects, the Golden Coast and the Bre Hill apartment, and the suburbs shopping mall.
According to the agreement with his late father, Colin, known by his brother Paul as the "main promoter and dominant figure" of the De Rutis family, owns about two thirds of the corporate assets, while Paul accounts for about one third of the company's assets.
Documents submitted to the Tribunal indicate that Colin owned property valued at $316 million, while Paul owned property worth $176 million.
Paul came to think that the division of real estate and cash proved to be the problem of negotiation.
" Colin's proposal for the division of property left him what I thought was best " , as he wrote in a first court oath in 2015.
Last Friday, after several mediation failures, the Supreme Court held its first hearing.
Now, these two brothers are still fighting for control of the existing business, and Paul says Colin has kicked him out.
Colin denied it and accused Paul of being weak in managing certain real estates.
In Colin's early oath, he expressed his wish to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian tradition determines that family is the most important option. My Italian origin determines that family is the most important " , he wrote.
The cost of the case continues to rise and there are hundreds of pages of oaths, e-mails, and company reports submitted by companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, and company reports from senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Ms. De Rutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants, who started running popular restaurants and deli shops since the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunrick in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy Colin Wood property, where Colin opened the first jeans shop in the family.
Colin said, "I read three years old," where he founded Westco, "and then Paul was small."
Anna de Rutis said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to pass her property to his son in peace.
"Lugi used to tell me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court." She wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, were no longer members of the De Rutis Group, and Colin said Mark left the company, paid him $10 million and paid Luke $26 million.
Paul said Luke and Mark both "satisfied with their property division."
According to Eddie McGuire, television star Eddie McGuire to the biography published in 2015, he kept his head down, although Colin was a board member of the former AFL Club.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul on Friday, and their lawyers.
But Colin only answered by text message. He said, because the case was submitted to court, "I can't really say much."
"My brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family affairs to court, which is very, very sad." He wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
He said, "Our father doesn't want to see Paul and I finally have such a dispute," and added, "He still has hope for the settlement of the dispute."
Friday, this hope seems to be broken.
"Our problems will be resolved by court in the near future." Colin wrote.

The new Chief of Staff of Trump plans to limit the President's media time.
Others tried, but they all ended up failing.
John F. Kelly might be able to do it.
If that's true, he's the first.
According to the American political news site Politico, the new White House Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including the press report, with a view to ensuring that the boss is more stable.
Here is a quote taken from journalist Josh Dowsey:
"When the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly began his first day of work with senior officials, he pointed out that he was going to solve a major problem with President Trump's entry to the White House: bad information flowing to the President."
Kelly told these officials that receiving good information would help the President make better decisions, so it needed to follow his hand, whether in writing or in the form of briefings.
Kelly's diagnosis looks like it, but others have tried to tame it through surveillance of Trump's media time, but eventually they all ended up failing.
President Trump's television addiction has been a long time -- he's still getting deeper in the White House.
In February, Sam Naberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico that "If candidate Trump was frustrated with unfair reporting, it would be good to know that he would be very useful in getting positive reports on credible channels.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote, "In the light of the experience of six former campaign officials, the focus of controlling Trump Twitter is on ensuring that a certain amount of praise has been included in media information he received personally."
It's totally fine.
But Trump's Twitter used to be "controlled" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know -- that if they don't intervene, Trump's Twitter would even be even more hot.
We probably never knew the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his staff can save him in the fire, even a few times, their efforts are worth it.
But no one can keep stopping Trump from being controversial.
Part of the problem is that in a White House of competing groups, people promote their worldviews and their cause by submitting information that may be reliable or unreliable to Trump.
Politico -- all about this story -- reported in May that consultants' hobby to provide suspicious information to the President.
This is an example of what journalist Shan Goodmancher described:
"The current and former Trump officials say that Trump's reaction to negative news clips is like volcanic eruptions, especially those that are destructive information leaks, and he's madly trying to find out where it came from.
At the end of February, an article on GotNews.com, the Internet instigator Charles C. Johnson's website, was charged with the Deputy Chief of Staff, Katie Walsh, who was "a source of information leaks" in the White House, when Trump was acting like that.
Even if Johnson was permanently banned by Twitter for harassment, he did not provide any specific evidence, and he had blown up a lot of wrong quality control and later publicly denied it.
Trump read the article and started asking officials about Walsh. "
Goodmancher also said that then Chief of Staff, Rains Pribas, and White House Secretary Robert Potter, had tried to build a system to manage and record the documents received by Trump."
And what happened?
Kelly's gonna do the same thing, three months later.
Maybe he can prove himself more efficient than Pribas, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his assistant is still competing for influence.
These eternal factors will make Kelly's mission difficult.

In 2016, the provincial government office officially released the "Implementation of the Construction of Tourism and Wind Towns in Zhejiang Province", which proposed the name of about 100 folk people in the province through about five years of acceptance and inspection of about 100 folk people in the province, with a beautiful ecological environment, and a rich provincial tourist town in tourism.
These towns are now a major destination for Zheshan tourists to enjoy Zheshan, read Zheji culture and feel their sorrows, and will also provide important help to save my efforts to build the most beautiful tourist destination in China.
The head of the provincial tourism department introduced that, in the boom of the creation of tourist towns, we now focus more on the construction of personalized tourism industries, new tourism projects and business patterns, bringing a rich experience to tourists and have won a good reputation.
It's about promotion.
Recently, the Zhejiang City Tourism Authority, Zhejiang Daily News Group, hosted by the Zhejiang Daily Press Group, and the Zhejiang Group Tourism All Media Center shared the exchange of the "Sings of the Zhejiang City" and the "Spoken of the Zhejiang City of Zhejiang" at the Zhejiang Province Exhibition.
"The wind town has the beauty of art, the temperature of life.
The town's style is the original juice, the smell, the country, the pureness of the original ecology.
"Student at the Chinese Academy of Fine Arts, Faculty of Film and Animation Arts, Director of the National Film Advertising Director, Xie Xianxiang, and Professor Xu, Director of the Chinese University of Metrology, Professor Xu, told the cross-border story of small towns like "town town in the camera" small village.
Zhejiang's many tourist towns have a deep cultural resource, and the new town representative from the south of Lake County has read the country's painting Nanjo.
Gangnam Shui is a very popular book painter, and now Nanju Town works in depth with art colleges like the Chinese American Academy.
Tourism-style towns must have elements, tourism elements, service elements and environmental elements.
In this case, tourism services and the environment are also important elements.
If it's raining, it'll make tourists better experience the town's style.
In this shared era, the hottest shared umbrella company that joined forces with the Zheung Group Tourism Center to customize a group of shared umbrellas for poetry Zhejiang, hoping to advocate the concept of "share? green" to raise the sense of civilized tourism and public moral hearts of tourists and town residents, to create a good tourism environment.
This is a bright spot in the "Spoken Zhejiang Zhejiang? Town's Wind" 2017 Zhejiang Touring Town Promotion Season.
I'm looking forward to it.
To date, Zhejiang Province has issued a list of 21 provincial tourist style towns and 115 provincial tourist-style towns.
As a priority area for rural tourism, priority development during the 13th and 5th period, the wind town will eventually build a tourist landscape above 3A, becoming a new model for tourism products, high tourism benefits, industrial integration.
The importance of the tourist town is its original juice.
The beauty of the tourist town, not only from the small bridge of smoke and rain, but also from a long cultural tradition; rural revitalization, which is based on cultural confidence.
Internationally, the Dutch town of Liser, Halstadt, Austria, the town of pumpkins in France, with tulips, salt and pumpkins as the core attraction, attracting a large number of tourists from around the world each year to boost the economy of the town.
For the wind town, the focus of "emphasis, retention of homelessness" has given the town a clear personality and soul, and more about providing cultural immersion, carrying local literature, and highlighting rural civilization.
Touring town, with culture and homelessness, humanities and landscape as a carrier, and then four tourists, allowing traditional style and culture to inherit, innovation.
In essence, the tourist town is a complex, open tourist area, and it should be a shared living space for local residents and foreign tourists and even travellers.
As the main battleground for future tourism growth, tourism style towns may not only change the rural ecological landscape, the economic and social development approach, the direction of industrial elements, but also to address the urban-rural infrastructure divide and awaken the recovery of rural culture.
In the wave of accelerated revitalization in the country, Zhejiang Tourist Town will be a rich and better story.

RVs negotiate the ditch and return to the Rich Street.
Some of the richest owners in the West Midrandz region have another dispute with determined RVs, which consult on a government-drilled ditch demanding the return of land outside the mansion.
RVs parked their 20 trailers outside the luxurious Soliher Street, which was named "The Rich Street".
The RVs took horses, held babies and led the RV convoy, returned again after they were expelled in May, and the city's moat didn't stop them from entering.
This smooth, old team found a gap in this defense line, although there was no roadblock suitable for passage, their vehicles were squeezed through that gap.
Angry residents criticized the Solihull Council for "a bad performance in dealing with this issue".
A resident who didn't want to be famous said, "They came there on Monday night, before they came to Bentley Heath Street and threw stones at the past roadmen.
The committee should be ashamed of what they did, because they were completely useless in dealing with the problem.
The RVs came here in May and were expelled, and now they're back.
A lot came last night, and today might be more."
She added, "The Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with it by implementing a long-term ban to protect its park.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and if the council can't stop things like this, I'm not willing to continue paying municipal taxes.
One local resident who didn't want to reveal his name said, "This is ridiculous. We just saw a group of RVs go, just to destroy it in another group.
This time, the number has increased, and some even saw horses eating grass on the park lawn. "
A female spokesman for the Soliher Committee said, "We know that someone is running unauthorized camping on an open ground on Sjutzbrook Road, and now we work with the Soliher police and take the necessary legal action to move them out as soon as possible.
In support of our collection of evidence, it is important that as many local residents report any antisocial or criminal acts to the police by calling 101.
This helps us to outline the profile of the situation when submitting the case to the Court ... "

Italy ' s tough attitude towards NGO migrant rescue vessels
Italy warned NGOs operating migrant rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they would not be allowed to continue their rescue if new operational regulations were not signed.
Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, in an interview with the daily Turin newspaper News, said, "It's hard to see what they think they're going to do if non-governmental organizations do not sign new codes of conduct."
On the day before Minneapolis warned, Italian authorities seized the crew of a German aid organization Youth Rescue ship actually collusion with human dealers to assist illegal immigrants.
The aid organization operates for only one year and refuses to comment on the specific subject of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Carltocio.
In a social media statement, the organization said, " For us, saving lives is now and will be the most important thing, so we regret that we cannot operate in search and rescue zones at this time."
" After collecting all information, we can only assess all allegations and situations at this time ... "
Italian officials have been monitoring the ship Iuventa since October.
Its crew was suspected of carrying migrants directly from small boats and allowed smugglers to flee in hasty and reuse of the ship.
According to the prosecutor's documents, at least one such meeting is said to have occurred at sea 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, which was published by the Italian media.
Its crew was suspected of openly ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which supervised rescue operations in the area out of humanitarian enthusiasm rather than any other motive.
According to the rules of conduct, ships like Iuventa clearly require an Italian police officer to monitor their activities on board.
Currently, of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations, only three have agreed to comply with the code of conduct: Save the Children, based at Mal's Immigration Maritime Aid Station and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
On Thursday, the latter stated that it considered that the new provisions were unnecessary but acceptable, as they did not bring any "main changes and obstacles" to their rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign were Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Mindy claims that the number of immigrants arriving in Italy has dropped sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guards and joint local mayors have begun to work.
The Minister said, "We've been seeing the dawn at the end of the tunnel in recent days."
He announced the plan for the current month's in-depth talks: to discuss economic development activities with Libyan mayors and to discuss with Chad, Niger and Mali on how to reduce the number of immigrants who want to leave these countries to Europe.

Beijing New Initiative for Higher Education: 10,000 teachers and students from North Chemical will be stationed in Changping New School District
The opening ceremony of the new campus of Beijing Chemical University was held in Changping District, Beijing, with 1,800 acres of green campus officially operational.
Journalists learned from the ceremony that in recent years, in order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and governance of "large urban disease", in recent years, Beijing has accelerated the promotion of central urban higher education to the suburbs, with teachers and students moving to the new suburbs of the suburbs in the context of Kyinjin's desire to work together to develop and disintegrate non-capital functions.
The new campus of the North Chemical Industry is located in Changpingnanguchi, covering 1,800 acres, 40 km from the city, and is one of the priority projects in Beijing City to de-advisory functions.

When we look back at this year's film market, we found that the original text of the film and the two groups of stars who participated in the film became an important part of the film's expected audience.
At 1710 hours today, the 119 command centre in Shunyang City was called to fire at the four-hydrofurans stored at the Hong Jiu Tong plant in the city's double-cleaning district.
The Shunyang Fire Department immediately transferred 20 fire trucks to the scene with heavy anti-chemical suits, anti-cleaning vehicles, etc.
After preliminary detection, the fire was a small storage tank for chemicals such as tetrahydrofurans, producing a larger smoke.
As of the time the press sent the paper, firemen were on the ground, and the department of municipal health, security, environmental protection, security, transport, etc. had arrived at the scene without any casualties.
Michelle Carter was sentenced for texting Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and telephone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20 years old, will serve 15 months and can be converted to a probation after the end of the sentence, plus five years' probation.
Carter was convicted in June against Conrad Roy for an unintentional non-premeditated murder, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is so sad.
My son is my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free during the appeal.
She's facing a maximum of 20 years in prison, but her team thinks she and Mr. Roy are mentally ill.
At the time of the sentence, Carter stood up, wearing red pants and rice shirts, tight hands, tears, eyes down.
"She killed Conrad Roy." The prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life for herself better.
She's not responsible " , the prosecutor said.
"She has no regrets."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible consequence, she regretted it very much."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find her "age or maturity, and even her mental illness would have any significant impact on her behavior."
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, and she said, "I don't have a day to lose my beloved son.
I hope he's proud of everything I and I have done... and I'm trying to stand with his sisters in all my pain, which will accompany us forever " , and declare that...
Mr. Roy's sister Camdyn Roy testified that she was "suffocating" because she realized she would never be able to attend her brother's wedding or become his child's aunt.
"The loss of a man who has been with me since I was born is a pain, and my life will be with it." She said.
This case seems to have created a legal precedent, because Massachusetts law does not provide for encouraging others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead from carbon oxide poisoning in the car; this year Carter was 17 years old.
Carter's text revealed that after she encouraged him to commit suicide, the case triggered national attention.
"Standing, jumping, stabbing himself, and there are many ways... " She said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death; he was on vacation with his family.
The time before he committed suicide, she wrote, "You need to do this, Conrad," "All you have to do is start the generator, and then get free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter had come to pay attention through Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There are legal differences in this case.
There are few people defending Carter, Amanda Knox, one of them, who was charged with murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and declared innocent two years later.
In a column published by the Los Angeles Times, 30-year-old Ms. Knox said, " Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment."
Zhang is destined to be a controversial film artist, and since he started making his first film, Red Goo, he's been leading the Chinese film boom, and he's been getting a lot of bad talk.
Reporter learned from the Lassard Net Basketball Club on 2nd day that recently, the Lassard Net Land Basketball Youth Team won fourth place in the finals of the National Youth Basketball League in Beijing.
The Lassard Net Land Basketball Youth Team consists of 11 native players, and the coach is the assistant coach of the Lassards of the Insang Ju.
Tibetan basketball boy before he went to Beijing to the finals.
Liang Jun-hyun, Managing Director of the Lassard Net Land Basketball Club, told reporters that the team's performance had improved significantly compared to last year, and that the confidence of players and other teams had increased significantly.
After the game, Captain Jiang Zhi said he wanted to do his best for Tibet's basketball business by building experience in the game.
It is understood that in Beijing, players overcome low-altitude drunk oxygen and demonstrated the image of Tibet.
Although the track is a golden house at the Olympics, the trackrs are in the world, the name of the track will be lower than the gold.
Automobile manufacturers are under shock, and Audi will modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles.
The day before Audi announced the conversion, the BMW said it would provide software upgrades to over 350,000 cars.
The BMW Chairman said that BMW believed that "drive more intelligent options than restrictions" means that major European cities -- including Munich, the headquarters of BMW -- consider prohibiting or limiting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that 3 million Mercedes cars in Europe would be modified to reduce its diesel emissions.
No company claims to be recalled.
European auto manufacturers have been promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emission requirements.
But nitrogen oxides released by diesel engines are considered carcinogenic substances and may cause asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset the cost of diesel tail gas emissions is also increasing, and it is therefore difficult to maintain the price competitiveness of diesel vehicles.
As German auto manufacturers face censorship, Prime Minister Angela Merkel's government was also accused of being too powerful car companies and ignored the signs of this problem.
These automobile companies are trying to avoid repeating the public, covering up their use of so-called failure devices, adjusting emissions during car testing to comply with regulations and returning to normal driving conditions.
Many mass executives are accused in the United States, while other executives are under investigation from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Last month, former head of thermal mechanics at Audi Engine Research and Development was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zachero Giovani Pamio, an Italian, is therefore not protected from extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving the public, and the German government accused Audi of installing systems to avoid Europe's emission requirements, expanding the scope of investigations that were previously limited to the United States.
Audi's investigation could have a significant impact on the public: luxury car manufacturers account for a disproportionate share of the profits of Volkswagen.
A film, which lasts a year or two or years, is common.
The animation film "The Big Fish Seagull" announced that it would be released on July 8, from preparation to 12 years!
The original author of the Big Fish Seagull, 21 years old, founded the other side with his friend Zhang Chun, who received a venture capital of millions of dollars in 2008 and launched animated film virgin "The Big Fish Seagull".
The film has won many awards in the country and abroad at the creative sample stage, and has been recorded by the French Centre for Contemporary Art in Pompido and praised as "one of the most outstanding works of art".
Because it took six years from creativity to production, the film was called the "The Pocket of God" by millions of fans who were looking forward to show.
The Big Fish Seagull tells a story that belongs to the Chinese, and with the release of this set-up trailer, it brings new expectations to all viewers.
Liang said, "This is the only thing that's been done in 12 years, and now it's from a dream to reality, and I'm both nervous and excited."
Zhang Chun said, "I'm going crazy to think about making exactly the same image as anyone else's budget."

Provence lavender is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there is bad news that it is being threatened by climate change.
Lavender is decaying due to the ongoing drought and the presence of insects carrying the virus, which has caused a headache for scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Institute in Provence, said, "The lavender in Provence is facing enormous threats, because the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, spring rainfall has been significantly reduced, and the fall is raining.
It affects the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a smaller individual, a leaf that can spread tiny bacteria, and in very dry weather, they appear in large quantities. "
The point is that it's huge.
The elegant lavender field is also admired by the perfume and cosmetics industry, in addition to attracting vacationers.
Eric Chase says, "In contrast to the plant that can open many flowers, with a long valley, we have a problem of small individual development, lack or weakness.
So we have less oil. "
Solutions under study include better irrigation techniques and mitigation of evaporation of soil moisture, spraying of clay and water protective mixtures on plants and the development of more drought-resistant varieties.
Compared to the science fiction elements in the film, the two actors say that they're more attractive to stories in the film.
On the afternoon of September 5th, journalists from the Washington Metropolitan newspaper, interviewed several prominent speakers in a row, and two voice-speak artists, which are surprising that they are almost consistent and silent.
One is the Berlin Shadow Emperor, one of the rising young actors, and the first partner of Lifan and Li Yi Feng.
Mexico is in danger. Journalists are killed.
All employees of the Riodoce Weekly usually meet on Wednesday to review their reporting plans for the Sinaro riots, which are caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But today, the shadow of tragedy is themselves, and they gather to discuss security.
They were told to change their daily habits, which is important.
Two senior journalists discussed which was safer: whether their children should be taken to the office (the office was attacked by grenades in 2009) or left them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemies, neutrals and allies.
They let these reporters name each column -- no evidence, observation and instinct.
There are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on the government list, or cartels, who are suspected of putting Mexican reporting at risk.
Violence has been on the ground, with more and more journalists in the country: according to the records of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Penia Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists were federally protected after attack and threat; so far this year, at least seven journalists have died in seven states.
The last one died was their editor and inspiration, and Javier Valdez Cadenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
Valdez wrote a lot of books about drug violence, in which he wrote, "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist."
You can feel deeply that he's gone, although he's everywhere -- a huge picture hanging on the front of the "Ridoce" office building, Valdez has a middle finger, with the word "Justice"; Aaron Ivala and Miriam Ramirez, who also showed his smile on his 30-year-old journalist's T-shirt, wearing glasses or his landmark Panama straw hat.
The seminar was held less than two months after his death; journalists discussed their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and suspicion.
Although a special federal prosecutor ' s office was established in 2010 to deal with press cases, according to the records of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two persons were prosecuted.
Most of the thousands of crime cases every year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so few people who killed journalists are brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they insist on reporting violence in Sinaro, although they're broken, although the land is so full of shit.
Ivala said that there was no information about the killer, there was no justice, it would be no use to hold a security seminar.
He said, "It's stupid to waste time for a seminar like this.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15th, Valdez left the "Ridoce" office in Curyakan.
His red Toyota Carola was stopped by two men only a few blocks; they forced him out of the car, fired 12 shots, guessed because of the name of the newspaper -- translated into "Twelve Rivers".
The criminal drove his car and destroyed it nearby.
Valdez is 50 years old.
Leave his wife and two grown children.
There's been four rumors in Culiacan.
But there's nothing but silence about Valdez.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and extradited the United States in January, Sinaro has become the most bloody battleground in the country, and hostile forces have been madly killed.
One or more people on the streets of Sinaro are shot every day, and the cemetery is full of two-storey mausoleums, which are common.
For the time being, forget the state of calmness is when only one cartel controls the beach state and its port and drug trafficking route to the United States.
Even so, even if Valdez knew the dangers of the job, 60-year-old Riodoce co-founder and director, Ismail Pohoque, felt guilty for not protecting his friends.
He believed that two mistakes caused this tragedy.
First, in February, Damaso Lopez was published, leading a cartel group fighting several Guzman sons.
This report may have provoked these sons; the newspaper was bought by suspected gang members as soon as they were sent to the press stand.
The second mistake was that the newspaper that reported the same story was confiscated without forcing Valdez to leave Mexico for his own safety.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great importance to Mexican violence against journalists.
His spirit is long, his friends and colleagues believe he's always been with us.
In 2003, he was a senior journalist for "Noroeste", when he joined five colleagues to start Riodoce and sold $50 in shares.
Pohoqui said, "In Sinaro, "The news industry can't stop dealing with drugs."
As time passed, the newspaper won a good reputation for bold and honest reports, and sales and advertising have increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish direct-attacks, without fear of censorship, and readers like to publish stories in newspapers that others are afraid to report.
Riodoce won the Maria Moscabo News Award five years after its inception.
The Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the Valdez International Press Freedom Award in recognition of his courage to pursue the most true Mexican drug coverage.
He's scared, too.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the award, he said, "I want to live."
Later in late October, he said in an interview on local television, Rompeiento TV, "In Sinaro, drug trafficking is a way of life,
You must take the task of falling on your shoulder as a journalist -- either so, or deaf and dumb.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many deaths and why don't you speak about what's happening?"
All the workers of Riodoce miss Valdez, and miss him as cursed like a dock worker, and this friend who never hugged and advised, missed this teacher who knew how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar across the office, always sitting on the same table.
Now they'll ask, "Is his daily habits causing his fall?"
His death also made them think about how to do their job and live.
Bohoqui said, "They don't like the trouble you're giving their women and children, or you don't like your legitimate companies and secret airports used to transport drugs.
It's all crossed their bottom line. "
The result is that even at the safest time, you have to keep a high degree of self-censorship and self-protection.
Believe in your instincts.
If you smell dangerous, get away from it.
"Ridoce" editor Andrés Villaril said, "The problem is, "The smell is a feeling of being deceived and then something like Javier will happen."
He and others said that the previous rules were no longer applicable to Sinaro -- just as they no longer applied to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where the smuggling routes were profitable, and institutions were weak, government officials were corrupt and so greasy.
The situation is changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees took security training, mobile phones were suddenly not allowed; a few days ago, spy software allegedly sold only to the government was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two cops were cold in the shade, avoiding the high temperature of 104 degrees.
They're from the state government to protect Riodoce's office, which are located in a four-storey building in the middle class block of Curyacan.
Some reporters are joking about whether these cops belong to 50% of the trust the governor himself said.
The reporters have been in the mountains for months, where drug dealers are under real control.
The Riodoce story this week is about three big things.
Among them was the killing of the brother of Julio César Chaves, a great former boxer in Sinaro.
The government funds from the governor's home town are also disclosed.
And the kidnapping in a expensive restaurant in Curyakan, which is only a block from the prosecutor's office.
The official did not publish information on the subject of kidnapping and the kidnapping process, so it needed to be careful and careful when writing what the city knew: the restaurant was where drug dealers and officials loved it.
A journalist learned from public files that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician of the ruling Revolutionary System (PRI), which dominated almost all political classes throughout the last era.
Recently, several governors of the Revolutionary System Party were accused of corruption in several highly valued cases.
Villaril asked the press to write about what happened at the scene of the incident, including a son of a Mexican drug lord, Guzman, who escaped from the military attack.
If a few months ago, readers would have looked at Valdez's column and find the most powerful information about the kidnapping.
46-year-old Villaril was called "skinny" because of his thin body, and he said, "We knew what was going on before.
Now all our sources of communication are cut off.
Valdez's office is now used to store signs and stickers that protest against the killing of journalists, because the employees became the way they never wanted to be: representing the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez took a sign out of the room and went to the local prosecutor's office to attend a march related to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Waldiz was killed in Michaken, west.
Officially found a burned body and said that according to DNA tests, this is his body.
All over the country, journalists have become more open, and they organize protests, and they paint the words "Save the media" on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, Director Bohoqui was not in Washington, and he was trying to get international support for the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez was killed, in a meeting with the Governor of Sinaro, Ramirez accused the official spy on journalists and killed them because they told the truth.
Given her anger that has affected her objectivity, she also asked to resign from the post of government.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that Mexican journalists are surrounded by organized crime, contaminated government officials and indifferent societies.
In his last book, "Drug News", he wrote that journalists were not only disabled by drug trafficking groups, but also on the list of politicians and security forces who were in the same way as organized crime.
The media inspection group Articulo 19 blamed over half of the press attacks last year to the police and public officials.
Ramirez said, "In Mexico, they let you die to shut you up."
Apparently, these murders are chilling.
No one forgot six years ago, the blogger Maria Elizabeth Marcias died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
There's a note by her body allegedly signed by Zetascat: "I'm here for my story."
Her head was cut off, with a computer keyboard and headphone.
After Miroslava Brech was killed in March, some newspapers chose to close down, such as the El Norte newspaper on the northern border of Chivawa.
Others are continuing, and the director of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo was killed in 2014, but they were still going on.
In 2010, Diario de Cidad Juarez used a front page to speak publicly about drug cartels, entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their home town or even left the country.
It's a tough choice.
It's hard to find a job in exile, and they still need to be careful on the streets and beware of danger.
Sometimes they're arrested, and in 2015, photographer Ruben Espinosa was killed in a Mexican city with four women three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind the scenes, it's a daily step of high-risk decision-making.
Ivala wanted to be a poet, and he admitted to reporting on the drug trade that scared him.
He said, "Mexico is becoming hell, so I became a journalist."
The last Friday night, the latest issue of the newspaper has been printed, and the editors of Riodoce sit outside the walkway and drink beer, and suddenly their phones ring.
There was a series of gunfights and security forces near Masatland, beach resort city, confirmed 19 deaths.
The war is still on the rise, as a series of cartel information found in the region.
They're uploading the news on the "Ridoce" website by the side of the road.
The headlines of the next day had to change.
The siren sounded around here -- another shooting in the area.
Bohoqui looked at the police standing there to watch if they were alert.
If they're a little scared, then they don't show up.
The founder of the newspaper was killed, and in his great portrait, he pointed to the place where the whole Sinaro needed to look at, and all the staff of Riodoce followed his pace.
Pohoqui said, "How can you even want to close it? The same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her to the street to the story."
China's self-driving tourism market size or over trillion yuan in 2020
[Summary] In the context of consumption upgrading and freedom, self-drives are encouraged by national policies and the growing love of consumers.
But at the same time, it is expected to break the trillion-dollar self-drive market, but there are double challenges.
In the context of consumption upgrading and freedom, self-drive is encouraged by national policies and the growing consumer love.
But at the same time, it is expected to break the trillion-scale self-drive market, with the development of the self-drive industry not comparable to market demand, and self-driving clubs and travel agencies face a low-profit dilemma; on the other hand, the infrastructure and services faced by self-drives are still in the early stages.
60% of the total number of domestic trips, and the market size is expected to break hundreds of millions.
In 2016, 4440 million domestic tourism trips accounted for about 60 per cent of the total number of domestic tourism, and by 2020, the size of the self-drive market is expected to exceed trillion.
According to the statistics of the Chinese Tourist Ship Association on the number of self-driving trips, the number of people travelling from the last five years has continued to grow, with a steady proportion of tourists in more than half of the country.
At the same time, the regional and national levels have shown greater attention and support for the emerging area of self-driving, and policy regulations related to self-driving, residential and camping tourism were introduced from 2016 to 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments such as the National Tourism Authority, the National Sports Directorate, jointly released the "Plan for the Development of Automobile Self-Drive Camp Development" ; in the same month, the Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance, etc., jointly issued the Action Programme for the Promotion of the Quality Upgrading of Rural Tourism Development (2017), was highlighted.
The introduction of policies provides opportunities and policy guidance for domestic self-drive development.
The self-drive club is very profitable, and the whole chain of industry is the key.
Although domestic self-drive markets have great potential and national policies are actively guided, the self-drive industry is still in its early stages.
According to the Annual Development Report on China's Self-Drive Travel 2016-2017, home-based self-drive clubs, car clubs, car club, car club, car club, and so on, but the proportion of tourists in self-help arrangements for self-drives is the majority, and the proportion of visitors to various institutions such as the car club, the self-drive club, etc.
At the same time, online tourism enterprises and traditional travel agencies that have developed self-driving products are also numerous, and many online tourism platforms sell only self-drive products provided by some suppliers, and some self-drive clubs are important suppliers.
In terms of organizing self-drive activities, it covers "eating, living, swimming, buying, recreational" in many ways, high fragmentation, heavy upstream supply chain, and tourists consume randomly.
The founder and CEO Lee Chongjie of the Beijing Motor Club believes that the self-drive club is essentially similar to travel agencies, and the early main profit model is based on offline activities, with the core point of self-drive line products and lead services.
But today, the line products in the field of self-drive are highly symmetrical, and the lead service level is mixed, and the self-drive club faces the need for a new transformation.
As you can see, self-drive is not an independent industry in itself, but it is important to form a cross-geographical, industrial eco-circle, and it is important to form a complete industrial chain.
Experts have pointed out that experience is more important than basic tourism consumption.
Therefore, for the development of the self-drive industry, experience characteristics should be enhanced, the theme "self-drive plus" and the IP of the self-drive product.
The landscape is not just a road, but a car camp should not just satisfy accommodation and accommodation.
The basic development of self-drives is also more primary in the face of the rise of self-drive.
Li Chongjie points out that the tourist landscape is not just a road, but that the elements of transport and tourism need to be integrated into it, but road repair and tourism are themselves responsible for two sectors, the transport sector adds tourism elements, but also in building toilets, counselling centres, publicity bars, etc., and not very much integration with tourism.
Compared to the famous self-drive route, the 66th American Road, it's worth learning from the experience of building.
Landscape design is no longer the most direct and fast path between departures and destinations, but follows the design concept of "excessing the pleasure of driving" and providing self-driving tourists with the best enjoyment of the view of the road; the landscape can connect the point, face-to-face tourism landscape, both the historical and cultural values of ecotourism resources along the line, and the organization of thematic events to enhance the participation and swimming experience of tourists and create economic benefits for local tourism.
Besides the landscape, the camp is an important facility for self-drives.
But among the New Kyoto journalists, there are few consumers who choose to stay in the camp.
They believe that many camps are biased towards infrastructure, which only meets the need for eating, low grade, single products, and that they cannot meet the need for a lot of elements to travel.
According to industry people who do not want to reveal their names, many of the businesses who were camps in previous years were to take land, and after taking the land, and that later the infrastructure construction and services were not kept up, and many business was lost, and that it was difficult to make some corresponding products without late funding.
Consumer group
According to data published by the China Tourist Ship Association in 2017, self-driving groups are concentrated at 21-40 years of age, especially at 31-40 years, which have a certain economic base and high demand for personalized tourism and are mostly parent-child-to-child-to-child-to-child-to-child-to-child-to-child-to-child-to-child-to-child-to-child-to-child-to-child-to-child-to-child-to-child-to-child-to-child-to-child-to-child-to-child-swave clients.
From the accommodation survey, the self-drive population is relatively preferred for non-standard accommodation.
From the type of self-drive, the surrounding self-driving is the most important type of self-drive, or 84.32%.
It's a lot of people's desire to leave the country, but it's a small share.
And as consumption demand increases, tourists who used to like to drive their own "visit sites" began to change their minds, no longer "Get off and take pictures, sleep in the car," but to focus more on the experience and process of travel.
Dinosaurs use disguise to avoid the enemy.
At first glance, it's scary, but it looks like a statue.
Researchers have published the first research on the size of rhinoceros found by Canadian miners, and pointed out that the fossil was well preserved, so experts called it "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs".
This fossil is very well preserved, and it can even determine that its skin is red and brown, which means it has some "disturbing experience".
The story in the magazine Contemporary Biology describes it as "the best preservation dinosaur ever discovered and one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered type of stale dragons that live in the mid-term white twilight of 110 million to 11 million years ago.
It's very well preserved, and it shocked the researchers, and they described it as "real amazing."
According to the National Geographic Journal, the herb-eating cape dinosaur fossils are the best of the same dinosaurs ever discovered.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered this fossil when he dug the Senkol Millennium mine near McMerryburg, northern Alberta, Canada.
At that time, he ran into something that seemed to be different from the rocks around him, and he decided to look at it carefully.
Then the fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Canadian Museum of Terell.
It took six years for researchers to show the real face of this beast hidden inside 2,500 pounds of dirt.
After such a hard work, the final results are now published.
"If you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping," the first author of the Royal Tyrell Museum, Caleb Brown, said, "The creature is displayed at the gallery."
"It will be one of the most beautiful and well preserved dinosaurs in science history - Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world."
Researchers, by studying their skin, found that this herb-eating creature, though wearing armor, is like a walking tank, could be threatened by a major threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
The dinosaurs with heavy armor use red and white disguises to avoid predators and use hidden techniques called "anti-shake", which are also used by many modern animals.
Experts say that in this way it is better integrated with the surrounding environment, thus avoiding the enemy, which suggests that it is being hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This creature, with 110 million years of history, belongs to the family of the Dragons, and became the headlines for the first time in May, and is currently being displayed at the Royal Tyrell Museum of Biology.
Mark Mitchell, a museum technician, one of the team members, spent 700 hours carefully uncovering the veil of the beast, and researchers now study it and named it "Borealopelta markmitchelli".
The sample was extremely well preserved so that Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists could record the patterns and shapes of the scales and armor on them.
They found the anti-scatter, a common defense in the animal world, which means that the back of the creature is darker than the color on its side.
Although anti-scattering is common, the results were surprising, because the dinosaurs are much more in shape than existing animals using anti-scave.
This dinosaur is under pressure to be hunted by meat dinosaurs, thus evolving in a favourable direction so that it can hide it in the base as a means of survival.
But most of the existing animals, such as deer, zebras or tarts, are as small and fragile as prey, which suggests that the creature is under real survival pressure.
"The big heavy armor dinosaurs are being hunted crazyly showing how dangerous the white-skinned meat-eating dinosaurs are." Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also indicates that the dinosaur's skin colour is red and brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the life clues of the creature, including the stomach contents they keep to find the last food they feed.
They believe that dinosaurs fell into the river when they died, then washed into the sea, and eventually sunk into the sea.
At that time, Alberta's climate was as warm as the climate in southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans could be deeper inland than they are now.
Brown said, "This stale dragon is truly amazing because it is completely covered in the skin of the skin and is kept in the space so far, so that its original shape can be preserved."
"So the creature is now in almost the same shape as the white twilight.
You don't have to rebuild it with too much imagination; if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping."
The white twilight period is a period of two-footed animal foot dinosaurs wandering on Earth.
Although the Dragon is the king of dinosaurs, it appeared millions of years after the cape dinosaurs.
They include high thorn dragons, a giant weighing 6 tons, 38 feet long (11.5 meters).
Recent research has found scientists in Contemporary Biology that after the death of the Dragon was washed into the sea, and then formed mummies in the dirt.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink dug up the creature at the millennium mine near McMerryburg, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it's the world's best-reserved cape dinosaur, from the nose to the hip area, and so on.
This creature is about 18 feet (5 metres) and weighs 300 pounds (1300 kg).
It has two 20 inches long, the tip of the shoulder.
Researchers believe that this herb-eating cape dinosaurs are now active in the western part of Canada and then washed into the sea by flood rivers.
But this dinosaur is buried under the sea floor and keeps its armor completely.
The fossil remains of this special sample are kept very well, so that the remaining skin still covers the dented armor on the skull of dinosaurs.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine, it's rare to keep it like a winner.
The more I look at it, the more I think it's incredible.
The remaining skin fossils are still covered on the armor of the dinosaur skull.
Its right front hand is on its side, five toes up.
I can count its porn. "
Journalists learned that the addition of natural or plant-sourced algae acid, rotting acid and amino acid efficiency carriers to the urin production process can be modified in the urin production process, which can be modified to produce algae urine, zinc acid urine, gravy nitrogen use increase by 5-10 percentage points compared to normal urine.
Environmentally friendly, crop production potential is clear, especially with large particles value-added urine, which is a high-quality material for BB fat.
This total number of security personnel is twice as high as the 2012 London Olympics.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest security link ever.
Previously, the Brazilian Government stated that a total of 85,000 people from the army and police would fight together, including 20,000 soldiers and 65,000 police officers.
Most soldiers will be responsible for defending the Olympic stadium, while 3,000 additional soldiers will be responsible for security at international airports, subway stations and streets.
Police patrol other parts of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
According to the information received, 6,000 soldiers have arrived in about Olympic security services.
They patrol the main roads at the airport and the main roads connecting the airport and the Olympic Games, in addition to the four major areas of the Rio Olympics.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service sector is no longer new, and it is important to make regulation more effective and not formal.
How do radicals learn to answer the question: "Whose street?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was confused.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis sat in the bed of Abby and browsing through the Facebook web on his phone.
She found a high school student's post by chance.
It says, "The police just killed an 18-year-old child and lying on the street."
She found out that no one else had published this message on the feed, and she was confused.
A user who keeps pushing her the Dynamic Times.
Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man without weapons, was killed by a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri.
He put a picture of Brown's body lying on the street, and his body was lying on the street for four hours.
"Crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death is not new to her and her community.
She dropped her phone and didn't turn on Twitter again that night and read the tweets about the gathering on Canfield Avenue.
There's a police video and a picture of a man who calls himself Brown's father, and it says, "The Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feed, and a cop stood in front of a bunch of protesters with a barking dog.
She said in another video, another cop raised his rifle screaming, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
"It's not normal," Ferrel remembers.
"This is not what we're used to call a typical murder. "
That moment, I was chilling.
I was angry and cried."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11:00 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
In the next three years, what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson was the theme of a new documentary "Who's Street" on August 11th at the cinema.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, power and tenacity from the perspective of people living in this community, crowded alleys asking answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter drove to Ferguson together, they re-discused the subject they discussed a million times before that morning -- "On black experiences and black conditions."
"Do you remember when I taught you when black people had to fight for their faith?" She remembered.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, which is not right.
I had to take her, "Felrell later said.
"What happened today was the orgasm of everything in the past.
She needs to know, see and rise from this.
She needs not only to develop well in radicalism and organization, but also to understand what we have to do to get freedom and liberation at different levels of black experience and black conditions.
Even if I had the privilege of providing her with racist experiences she had not experienced, she was no different from any other black girl.
If I protect her on this, I think I'm hurting her. "
They arrived at Ferguson's first stop opposite a station opposite the South Florida Road police station, which became their camp until Officer Darren Wilson finally failed to sue.
Ferrel and her daughter contacted a local corporate owner who made a bag of lunch.
They've prepared the bag to pass the bag to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrell began to form a new kind of actionism.
She said, "My radicalism changed completely after August 9th. "When she studied undergraduate at St. Louis, Missouri State University, she was president of the Association of Minority Nurses and Students, focusing on the food justice and health gap in black communities.
"I have no organizational experience.
It's all just coming. "
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with the film co-director Sabah Fryyan during a night parade.
Fryyan said she and her photographer Lucas Alvarado Faller were just trying to record what happened.
There's a question in Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to record or find a story you can use?"
This suspicion comes from many of these cases: people -- usually white people -- enter a community to gain benefits from their pain and resilience.
As Fryyan explained in his last interview, "We heard that the natives of Ferguson didn't concentrate their voices, and we wanted to do it in different ways."
Frejan has contacted co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for radicalism against dead prisoners.
His involvement brought Ferrell and six other locals to join the project team "Who's Street" project, a few years after Brown was shot.
"This documentary is not spoken to us or talked to us, this is our speech." Davis said.
"I'm concerned about how these characters are presented, because it's the way I'm being presented."
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrel's experience -- it's about the campaign "not about the Savior's leader, but about community cohesion," Fryyan says -- it turns out she's the most open in the film participants.
And as a result, "Who's Street?" It's amazingly recorded Ferrell's personal life, like falling in love, getting married.
"I feel naked," Ferrel laughed when he first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that doing this and humanizing blacks must be a certain degree of vulnerability ... "
Moreover, the story of Ferrel reiterated and repositioned the role of black cool women in the wider movement of black life events.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- created in social media after the black teenager Trevor Martin shooting in 2012 -- were considered cool.
"The black cool women in the leadership have generally supported the movement," Ferrel said, "That's because we're fighting on multiple fronts.
Black cool women must bear all this. "
Fryyan agreed and said, "This movement is really supported by black women and many black cool women."
For her identity, Ferrel was chosen as the core of the film, but she insisted, "This is not a positive action for things."
"She's the one who inspired this energy," she said.
"Although she's on the front line, it's not a coincidence... because in these crossroadss, as a black cool woman, you have a lot to do.
You can feel her energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras have long disappeared, but tense ethnic relations between the community and the police remain.
Farrell was sentenced to two and a half years ' probation due to attempts to block the highway during a march.
She described what she called the socio-political atmosphere of the family: "A mess."
Nevertheless, since she walked to the streets of Ferguson three years ago, she has insisted on her efforts to remember the holy song.
"We have a duty to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other to support each other.
We can't lose any more, except for the chains on our bodies. "
In fact, online translation services were provided on the Internet 10 years ago, and it was a long time ago that the theory of "machines are about to replace humans."
Similarity: Artists use Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
There are many faces in the heart of the Friedman Gallery in New York: white, black and brown, and there are almost undetectable similarities between each face, which are bound by ropes falling from the ceiling.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg using Chelsea Manning to send her cheek cotton and hair crumbs.
Manning sent hair crumbs from Livingworth Prison, who was sentenced to 35 years ' imprisonment here for leaking confidential diplomatic telegrams through WikiLeaks website.
The exhibition opened on August 2nd, entitled "The Similarity".
This is the result of a communication between Dewey Hagburg and Manning for two years, and Dewey Hagburg combines his disciplines with his own technology, computer science and art, while Manning is a famous dissident, who was imprisoned and has completed a transsexual surgery in prison.
By doing algorithm analysis from Manning's DNA, and it created 30 portraits of the "possible appearance." Heather Dewey Haborg made a sharp and slightly ruthless comment. His comments were both about DNA and the concept of identity itself.
Manning was born with Bradley Edward, who publicly admitted that she was considered a woman in adolescence. In 2013, he was convicted in 2013 involving 20 charges, including 6 espionage violations, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one picture, with a particle sense of black and white self-portrait, apparently uneasy, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a golden wig.
In 2015, Heather Dewey Haborg had a great success in her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
In that work, she created a 3D portrait of a 3D character that might be similar to the appearance of a 3D character using evidence from the smoker and gum medium court evidence.
That's an e-mail from PaperSmart.
"They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and need a portrait " , Heather Dewey Haborg said to the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning couldn't visit or take pictures, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if she was interested in making DNA portraits.
So the artist and her imprisoned muse became an impossible penmate, exchanged letters with each other for two years.
They even created a comic book, "The Repressed Head", by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted that the President could grant the privilege of Manning in the future, and she could see the exhibition in prison.
And Obama asked for her release a few days after the book was published, and it was a coincidence that Manning had spent her seventh year in Kansas Military Prison.
Moreover, the exhibition has another deep interest, because of the contemporary United States, the Trump government continues to declare war on government leakers and transsexual soldiers, while looking for new ways that can be made on Twitter to incite division nakedly, which is about to bridge this division.
When asked about all this special timing, Heather Dewey Haborg said, "There's a reason for everything."
In the artist statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's super-large signature was below (the "i" in the name) called for an end to the "sex, sexual orientation and culture-based party struggle."
The DNA sequence on the opposite wall is her linear particle, written in pencil twists the Cs, Gs and As symbols.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleic acid, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Heather Dewey Haborg wants to express at least in physical structure by painting these strange and similar portraits.
"I hope people get out of this dilemma, and our genome will not care who we are, how open genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is." Heather Dewey Haborg said that his 2007 video, "Fake Memory", is also on display.
"The DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so it's 30 of them."
The last piece in the exhibition, in a room, came from a page of the novel in the front illustration.
It shows the exaggeration of soldiers in the United States with the sound amplifier, the Golden King.
"When they stop your speech, they win." It says on the wall.
"So, don't shut up."
"These are directly from a letter she wrote to me." The artist from Philadelphia said.
"I'm just afraid again, I'm still going to say it."
Manning hasn't seen this exhibition personally, as the comic book predicted, but when she did, she would be her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters cheered at the gallery center.
It's also purposeful, like all the items in the exhibition, have reached the height of her genetic single-multiple mass information written in pencils (5.2 feet, Manning height).
"In the past, I hung them on the wall, but I hope they feel like a bunch of people " , and Dewey Hagburg spoke of portraits, saying.
"But I want them to feel like a group of protesters who followed Chelsea, just like they were protesting to release her."
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University staff are wanted for murder.
Police say that a man was found fatally stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago, and a Northwestern professor and an Oxford university employee were subsequently wanted and is currently looking for suspects nationwide.
Cook County Court records that Monday, 42-year-old Windham Lesem and Andrew Warren, 56, were issued without bail warrant for murder on suspicion of the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Durant.
According to the document, 26-year-old Cornell Durando died of multiple stabbings.
The community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department stated that the body was found on July 27th.
The police arrived at Grand Plaza's apartment when they got a call and found multiple cracks on the victim.
Police say Cornell Durando died on the spot, and the detective was investigating his murder, and the police were actively looking for two suspects.
Lesem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mail statement, Alan K. Cobbage, Deputy Director of School Relations, stated that Lesem had now been separated and banned from entering Northwestern University campus.
Kobage says, "This is a criminal case, and the authorities are investigating and Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation."
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
In an e-mail statement, the spokesperson at the Summerville College of Oxford said, "We have been in touch with the British police and ready to assist the United States investigative agency as needed. "
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would turn himself in.
Anthony Gullermi, Chief Liaison Officer of the Chicago Police Department, strongly encouraged the suspect to surrender to the authorities.
Gulemi said, "The police have a general idea of their whereabouts, and we're trying to locate the possible location."
Gulemi said that local, regional and national authorities were fully assisting in the search of suspects.
Gulemi said the police had received a call from Grand Plaza Apartment Manager, who just received a secret tip that apartment 1008 had happened.
The police said it was terrible.
Gulemi said it was still unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
He said that according to the security camera, confirm that Lesem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Lesem has something to do with the victim," said Gulemi.
Grand Plaza's management team issued a statement to the residents that "the police are currently studying the time lines and the background of the victim's murder, and are investigating motivations, including a possible domestic incident. "
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said, "We will complete the road map of the world anti-doping institutions in the near future."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko stated that it would not take too long to implement the remaining criteria for implementing the World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) against the restoration of the rights of the Russian Anti-doping Agency (RUSADA).
"The implementation of road map standards has reached some stage, and RUSADA has acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD.
The WADA road map was updated in this regard, "Mutko said on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko made the above statement in commenting on the second part of the World Anti-doping Agency Road Map "compliance". This part sets out the criteria for the restoration of RUSADA rights and recently published on the organization ' s website.
According to Mutko, the standard does not contain anything that may cause Russia's concern.
He added, "All has to be announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be submitted to the IOC in the near future [IOC] and WADA. "
However, one of the criteria mentioned on the list is that Russian anti-doping institutions must publicly accept the findings approved by Canadian lawyer Richard McCallen on the Russian State ' s support for the use of stimulants in their own sports.
Speaking of this, Mutko said, "We're investigating, our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind this, and we will not recognize what does not exist. "
Mutko responded to Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian public anti-doping committee.
Smirnov recognized the past problems of Russian anti-doping agencies in the media earlier that day, but he added, "We have said on various occasions that report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one planned to accept the report unconditionally, "Smirnov says.
After the stimulant scandal in November 2015, WADA suspended the right of RUSADA to perform stimulants in Russia.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate tests this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
When Director General Olivia Negrie visited the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, he said that RUSADA was "go in the right direction" and worked to restore its rights.
For computers, whether it's chess or national chess, defeating humans is no longer a word for decades.
In an interview with Davo Souk, President of the Croatian Football Association, said that participation in the Chinese Cup was very interesting for Croatian football, and that the Chinese Cup had a very large number of prizes.
No more substitutes! Over 8,000 products are zero customs duties.
At a routine press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on 11 January, the Department of Commerce ' s press spokesman peak stated that there were 15 FTAs in force to date, covering more than 8,000 imported products with zero tariffs.
Meanwhile, imported cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean wine, ASEAN tropical fruit... your products are no longer expensive.
Currently, we have 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and territories, 15 have entered into force, covering over 8,000 imported products with zero tariffs.
In agricultural products, for example, with the implementation of the FTA, consumers can taste agricultural products from different sources and quality.
For example, tropical fruits such as durians, gills, fire dragon nuts in ASEAN, have reduced import duties from 15 to 30 per cent to zero tariffs.
(b) The import tariff for Icelandic salmon was reduced from 10 to 12 per cent to zero;
(a) Wine in Georgia and Chile, with import tariffs reduced from 14 to 30 per cent to zero tariffs;
And New Zealand's specialty agricultural products like beef and milk powder have a significant tax reduction.
For example, industrial products, for example, some Swiss imports of cosmetics have been reduced to zero;
Some watch import duties have been reduced by 50 per cent and will be reduced to zero after a few years;
Import duties on refrigerators, electric rice pots, massage machines, beauty machines, etc. in Korea have been reduced by 40 per cent and will be reduced to zero after a few years;
And there's a lot of tax cuts for consumer electronics.
At the same time, zero tariff products under the FTA include intermediate products and raw materials required for the manufacture of many domestic end-consumption goods, which have also contributed to some extent the structural upgrading of domestic consumer goods.
The Department of Commerce ' s press spokesman peaked that nearly one third of our total imports were subject to preferential FTA tariffs, most of which were end-consumption, which brought real benefits to consumers.
Further reduction of import tariffs on consumer goods
Since 1 December 2017, our country has adjusted some consumer import duties to further reduce the import duties on consumer goods, covering all kinds of consumer goods, covering all kinds of consumer goods, including food, health products, medicines, daily chemicals, shoe hats, household equipment, cultural entertainment, daily groceries, etc., covering 187 eight tax numbers.
The average tax rate for this consumer goods will be reduced by 17.3% to 7.7%, almost "stop over"!
As of 1 January 2018, our country has also partially adjusted other import and export tariffs.
(b) The import tariff on some cosmetics such as lipstick, eye shadows, perfume has decreased from 10 per cent to 5 per cent;
After reducing customs duties, it means consumers don't have to buy it on their own, let alone go abroad to buy favorite foreign products.
The 2018 Yiu Imported Commodity Shopping Festival: Importing wine, snacks, fruit... is cheap!
The U.S. malls are very different at the end of the year.
China New Net, December 29th.
According to the American Daily World, Christmas is on the rise of return.
According to ABC, about half of the goods sold last Christmas were returned for exchange.
In addition, readers have been deceived many times, and consumers need to be careful when they shop on informal websites.
Generally, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable return procedures, but if you buy gifts or electricians from some small shops, you must be careful.
Ms. Ho of Rolandon bought a coat on December 1st at a online shop specializing in printing jackets, which cost 60 or more (US$, the same), and it has not been sent yet.
She sent an e-mail to the client, and she didn't answer.
There's another Internet user who went to the United States last year to buy a cell phone from a third-party seller and found it in it a box of rubber mud.
When you know you're being cheated, you're applying for a refund on the website, and you get a full refund.
But there are customers who think that the website refund service is not 100% perfect.
A Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident of Northern California, said that he had twice bought an emergency distribution service on a website, four dollars at a time, but it was not delivered on time.
Then I applied for a refund and no reply.
Large malls or shopping malls have better return policies.
Macy's most goods are fully refundd within 180 days.
But the goods must be "original" and have to have a purchase certificate like receipt or bank purchase record.
Without a certificate, customers can also get mall points to buy other goods.
Target usually has a 90-day return period for general goods, and electronics are usually 15 days.
However, the period of return of recreational goods purchased between 1 November and 25 December 2017 was extended to 30 days.
It is important to note that the 30-day refund period starts on December 25, i.e., to return the goods by January 25, 2018.
The great shopping experience, the new era of business shopping development.
More than a decade ago, we were generally in the seller market, with limited choices and limited demand.
But after 10 years of development, the market has already made a shift from the seller market to the buyer market, and today's consumer taste has become more obnoxious, and they are no longer satisfied with the simple "pay-to-hand delivery" shopping.
So, how to get consumers a very good shopping experience is the next competitive point for real estate developers.
And among the many factors that influence consumer shopping experience, the impact of shopping malls in the business circle is the most significant.
See how urban builders focus on shopping experience.
There are no two identical leaves in the world, and there are no two identical shopping malls, and a famous shopping mall must have its own characteristics.
For example, the world-renowned Kanyon mall in Turkey, whose unique wave-shaped architectural design is inspired by the Grand Canyon, and therefore named Kanyon, which is called the tune, is in the 200-metre walkway of Minister Kanyon as if it were in the Grand Canyon.
Besides the canyon design, there's a large elliptical performance site in the center of the shopping mall, unique appearance, and often special performances.
Because of the open platform design, tourists walk down every floor of the canyon and have the effect of moving the landscape.
And in the country, Nanking Forest Moore Business Street, known as China's first forest walk-through consumer, combines shopping with ecology, fairy tales.
700 m2 Green Square, 3,000 m2 roof water platform, project consists of nine single-body buildings, air galleries between buildings, designed to sink the courtyard as a whole, and the French tree above the ground is the surface of the building, roof water roof, creating a forest-like feeling.
Walking into the forest Moore, like an accident fell into Alice's rabbit hole, climbing the trunk around the building around, grass, springs, bringing people into a living and dynamic forest.
Also in Chongqing, the Rikabin Waters Circle, which plans to introduce over 50 top international flagship stores in the future, over 100 top international brands and over 500 well-known domestic and foreign brands, to become a service industry gathering, with a high-profile business centre.
Moreover, the Recabin Water Business Circle also integrates ecology into buildings, guided by TOD public transport, fashion shopping, living services, catering, entertainment, education, sports, while bringing them to consumers with a very good shopping experience, and also leads them to the unique "water culture" of Chongqing, which integrates shopping with water entertainment and leisure.
In conclusion, it can be found that some of the housing companies have now learned the discovery of this new urban business, while industry has indicated that this consumer experience is central to how to combine shopping with experience will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
The business circle is not just a collection of goods, but more a complex of art culture, creative themes, but also a responsibility for urban residence.
So, while meeting the needs of consumers to eat and play and buy one-stop substances, maximize the multi-level spiritual needs of culture and art, and the need for liveable residence is necessarily a high point in the future of the business community.
In Chongqing, the North Coast of the Nation, located in the north of the river, near the sound bridge, the world's commercial essence, the international giants, the first brand, the first brand, and the international fashion.
This is a place where the world is so beautiful;
Dongwon has a better shopping environment, and Dongwon is near the South Peng business circle, with a four-storey three-storey 3D transport system in the west and even the country, which increases the comfort of shopping.
(a) The greening of the garden on the two walking streets of Huida and Wanda Square, and the landscape has been upgraded to plant about 300 of the Chomu, and the renovation of 40,000 square metres and the image of the Southside Business Circle;
And Long Lake Lake One, near Chongqing's first low-density waterside business circle, surrounded by nine parks, low density of commercial blocks, high openness, makes people more willing to stay, stay, enjoy shopping slowly, rather than being held hostage by the people behind them, and really achieve "walk shopping".
Today's business competition will only get stronger and more intense, how to kill a blood-blooded path in a highly congenised market, winning the reputation of the future consumer's heart, and deserves all real estate developers to think seriously.
Only those who really put consumers in their hearts, and only developers who really put consumers in their hearts, rushing consumers, thinking about what consumers think, providing consumers with extremely simple shopping experiences can laugh at the market where the storm comes.
Of course, in the end, I think the happy people of Chongqing have such a good shopping experience and business circle, and no one could imagine today's prosperity 10 years ago.
Festival: Consumerist carnivals cover up real environmental prices
$16.82 billion, which is the deal that Skycat users consume within 24 hours of November 11, 2017, the Skycat Double 11 Global Carnival.
Specifically, after the opening of the double 11, the cat's deal was over $10 billion in three minutes, over $20 billion in 6 minutes and 05 seconds, and nine hours to break 100 billion.
On this day, the total number of payments made by consumers worldwide through payment of treasures reached 1,48 billion, an increase of 41 per cent over last year.
These consumption will bring 812 million logistics orders.
And whether it's Skycat Net or the Payable Platform, it belongs to the Ali Group of Ma Yun.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that on November 11th, single youth, created by a self-scoffing, will be edited by the electrician as a "two 11" shopping carnival.
On November 11, 2009, Ali Baba first used the "Scratch Festival" marketing twilight: no one was in love with you, so "single dogs" come online.
It was surprising that the deal at the day of the treasure shop exceeded $52 million, 10 times the amount of the day-to-day transaction.
Since then, the double 11 has become a shopping carnival built by Ali Baba, from the beginning of the domestic buyers to the current global business, and nine years later, the Skycat's double 11 billion deal was over 3,200 times the year, making Black Friday hopeless.
There are many electricians that are promoted to Windy Cats, of which Kyoto is the strongest.
"Kyodong" has its own shopping festival, "618", but it has no "two 11" impact, and this year, the cumulative sales of "Kyodong" reached $127.1 billion.
And after the "two 11s," followed by a "two 12" party like it, Christmas New Year's shopping period.
After the New Year, waiting for Chinese consumers to buy annual goods before spring, Valentine's Day shopping period, consumption, no vacation.
The environmental problems of instant consumption have attracted attention to professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua daily telecommunications, at the usual standard of 0.2 kg per container in the industry, at least 300,000 tons of garbage were generated during the "two 11" period this year.
Liu Hua, Director of the Pollution Control Project of the Green Peace East Asia Division, told China and the Foreign Dialogue that this year the order for the "two 11" cat only generated 160,000 tons of packaged garbage.
The National Postal Service issued a report in 2016 indicating that approximately 780 million fast pieces during the "two 11" period (11-16 November), using over 3 billion knitting bags, 99.22 million boxes, 16985 million metres of tape length, 425 laps of the Earth's equator.
This year, the National Postal Service predicts that the "two 11" fastware operations are expected to exceed 1.5 billion.
Wang, the manager of a garbage burning centre in Beijing, told Xinhua that the garbage that had been in the field after the "two 11s" was over 2,000 tons and more than the capacity of the burning station.
The express delivery company has realized that environmental pollution caused by the courier industry is inextricably visible.
Some electrician logistics companies, including Sunin, introduced recycled plastic delivery boxes before the "two 11s", which can be used as recycling bags and garbage bags, etc., but not very difficult consumer acceptance.
Ma Yun also called on the logistics industry to support Green Packaging and Green Logistics.
This tweet has more than 68,000 "sweet."
What kind of mobile payments do Germans want?
Zhang Winter: The mobile payment war in Germany is not expected.
We believe that the payment and payment of treasures have moved the battlefield to Europe, and the competition hasn't changed, nor has it changed — Chinese, which is globalization?
Where there's a payment, there must be a micro-credit payment.
Under the agreement with the German e-payment service provider Wirecard, micro-credit payments officially started landing in Germany in November this year and gradually set up businesses in Europe.
This time, the foreign country of the two "homes" took place in Europe.
All along the way to globalization, the payment of treasures and micro-credits has been singing on the path of globalization.
For China's way of globalizing mobile payments, Iri Consulting China's Third Party Mobile Payment Industry Study 2017 summarizes two types: one through strategic investment, experience output, equity and support for local mobile payment enterprises abroad.
Second, to promote mobile payment services to foreign businesses through Chinese tourists leaving the country, thereby changing the perception and acceptance of mobile payments from foreign countries to China.
Indeed, the Chinese have the world.
China's economic development is fast, plus the population base, and Chinese tourists are a tempting figure in Europe.
But it's also destined that this Chinese mobile payment war, which was launched in Germany, is not expected.
We believe that the payment and payment of treasures are just moving the battlefield to Europe, and the competition hasn't changed, the position of the competition has not changed, or the Chinese, or is that globalization?
More groundbreakingly, can China's mobile payments be expanded on European soil?
Take Germany, for example.
The magic "new retail."
Chen Yi, Yang Kai-han: Amazon announced his entry into a bookshop and grocery store when he squeezed into the world's top 10 retailers, both time and motivation.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookshop in Seattle, followed by two books in Portland and Santiago.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened a shop in New York and plans to own at least eight stores by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon Go announced that it would be run by no one under the flag, and that customers didn't need to line up, or to settle the door, and to get the goods you wanted, and the amount of the shopping would automatically be deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
In the case of Amazon, it's been a very surprising thing to move on the real store in recent years.
Because in its Open Letter to Shareholders as early as 2007, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon would not easily open physical stores unless the following four conditions were met at the same time:
1. We must be convinced that this new opportunity will return shareholders ' investments;
2. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great importance to the company as a whole;
3. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
4. We must be convinced that in this market we have sufficient resources to make customer-oriented differences.
Bookshops and grocery stores are the most shaky classification in the retail of the two entities and the first to fall after the rise of Amazons.
Amazon announced his march into the two real markets when he squeezed into the world's top 10 retailers, both timing and motivation.
Is the Amazon approach contrary to the guarantees in shareholder letters?
The other side of the Earth heard similar voices. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou Clouds Congress, the President of the Ali Baba Board, Ma Yun, gave a keynote address.
He said, "From next year, Ali Baba will no longer mention the term "e-commerce".
The era of pure electricians will soon end, and the next decade will be free of e-commerce, replaced by "new retail".
Underline and logistics are combined to generate new retail sales ... "
In a moment, the word "new retail" was like magic, and it was often held by industry.
But what does "new retail" mean?
If it's just a combination of online and below, then the concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer followed 180 of the largest electricians, estimated that the total sales of electricians were about $200 billion, of which the largest 25 accounted for over $159 billion.
Of these 25, 18 of them have only been operating traditional retailers on the line for the last five years (such as Massey, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
And the Ali Baba Group is $28.3 billion in the Suning Yun business, and it's been a long time ago.
Globally, retailers and electricians are moving from a single channel to a full-source retail system covering physical stores, electricians, mobile and social media.
Is Ma Yunti's "new retail" more a summary than a future?
If not, what is the difference between the concept of the whole channel and the new retail?
Perhaps the question is whether it's going to be integrated online and below, but how to integrate.
Looking back at the past 20 years of retail trade, the rise of electricians, as the rise of early-year discount retailers, focused on prices and convenience.
With these two pain points, electricians move very highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, from the line to the line.
As online consumption habits grow and customer experience increase, electricians stretch their tentacles to other categories and start to improve efficiency.
In the words of Ali Baba CEO Zhang Yong, "the use of Internet ideas and technologies to reform and upgrade the total number of some 30 trillion social retailers available, enabling the growing consumer demand of Chinese consumers to be effectively met, making the entire commodity production, circulation, service process more efficient because of the Internet, the widespread use of big data ... "
So the electrician road is a light asset, a real heavy asset.
"Light" means fixed assets, staffing, management processes, etc., without the burden of traditional retail trade; "heavy" means huge inputs that require huge inputs in logistics, storage, etc.
The change in logistics methods ensures the efficiency of the electrician.
According to the Chinese Government Network, Prime Minister Li Keqiang of the State Council chaired the Standing Meeting of the State Council on April 28, which considered that expanding domestic consumption demand was an important initiative to stabilize growth and structure.
The meeting identified that the relevant departments needed to draw on specific programmes on the basis of scientific assessments.

On January 18, Ali Baba held an electrician de-poor dialogue in Chongqing, announced that it would help to promote precision poverty eradication and rural revitalization by exploring a new model of the Internet + poverty eradication.
This is the re-enactment of Ali's fight against poverty after the country strategy, the launch of the rural treasure hunt project, the pro-poor platform for pro-poor poverty reduction.
The fight against poverty is one of China's most important national strategies.
The total poverty out of poverty has never been achieved in China for thousands of years.
"The electrician poverty alleviation is an innovative initiative for poverty reduction development and is an important catch to achieve precision poverty reduction and poverty reduction.
The central centre attaches great importance to and noted that the role of the Internet in promoting poverty eradication, promoting precision poverty reduction, precision poverty eradication, and getting agricultural products out of the countryside through the Internet ... "
Ali therefore proposed rural strategies as early as 2014 with big data cloud computing and globalization and as the three core strategies for Ali for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the Rural Treasures Project, recruiting Village Juniors in the countryside to lead farmers out of poverty through electricians.
In 2017, Ali worked with the business sector to build a pro-poor channel for farmers, which is now cumulatively connected to 13 provinces and 120 poor counties at the national level.
There are 2118 hunting villages that have been created by Ali Platform.
Of these, nearly 400 were found in poor provincial counties and 33 in 13 poor counties in 13 countries.
In 2017, on the Ali Baba Chinese retail platform, the national sales of treasure-hunting villages amounted to $120 billion.
Zhang Yong said that Ali had been thinking about how to use innovative capabilities such as good Ali economies, big data, cloud computing, and so on to get out of poverty.
Among them, village pick-up is the main carrier platform for Ali Electricians and follows a new link to the Internet for direct marketing.
In the planting chain, village and ant gold suits jointly carry out agricultural tools and micro-credit support.
In 2017, in 832 poor counties at the national level, ant gold suits served 795, providing them with easy payment, credit, etc.
The rookies solve storage and logistics, Skycats are responsible for selling, and Aliyun's big data anti-feeding guides agricultural production, further improving supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of electricians from poverty requires not only products, marketing channels, industrial planning, but also talent.
Ali has introduced an electrician course at the University of Treasures to teach farmers standardized, quality and scaled cultivation methods, a combination of "poor + mental reduction" to enable farmers to achieve sustainable poverty eradication.
These courses already cover about 92 per cent of the national poor counties.
And the idea of "public goods, business means" can guarantee Ali's "real poverty reduction" in poverty alleviation.
Ma Yun, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ali Baba, said that poverty eradication should be divided into three stages of poverty alleviation, poverty eradication and enrichment.
Poverty reduction is a fish, and poverty is a fish, wealth is a fish pond for farmers, and farmers have fish to feed.
The electrician-led industry is a fish pond.
In industrial poverty alleviation, Ali and Shaanxi Logawa's poverty reduction model has been replicated by the authorities as an example in the country.
Ali Electrician is also recognized by the decision-making level.
The electrician company represented by Ali Baba was sent to ensure an increase in farmers' production and revenue through online and offline channels.
Some village workers and ants are also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experience of electricians from poverty.
Currently, the China Office of the United Nations World Food Programme has been working with the village to implement the electricity industry in Anhui and others to combat poverty.
The Third New Economic Think Tank Congress, co-organized by Ali Institute, China Vision Think Tank, attended and addressed by Zhang Li, Director of the Institute of Commerce, Electrician Institute.
She thinks that our globalization actually ignores the most important issue, the physical and use of globalization, and the stage of globalization.
Many people think globalization has stalled, and many developed and developing countries, in the new phase, they have different attitudes towards globalization, which are different from models.
The second concept is the medium-term issue of globalization, and what are the constraints on the medium-term phase of globalization?
The economic environment base is the result of the changing globalization of the economic base.
Zhang Li believes that global economic adjustments will largely end at the end of 2017, and that a new round of growth will be in 2018, and the next round of growth must be a living product pull.
The first fresh supermarket in Kyoto has been officially opened recently and plans to build over 1,000 stores throughout the country for the next three to five years.
Plus Ali's box of horse, the super species of Yong Fai, Su-susheng of Suning, the palm fish of the troupe, the new retail store started to pile up and even "screaming boards" in innovative models and even prices.
The promotion of fresh supermarkets has become a topic of phenomenon in the new retail field. Where is the new retail?
"We'll be fast into the country in 2018, before spring festival, in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou will open a lot of shops."
The new game was revealed at the Second New Retail Summit at the second new retail summit.
"From 2018, the box of horses is not just a fresh electrician, but a life-type electrician that meets the immediate services of consumers.
Under the core model is a flow, experience, a real sale online. "
Different from traditional malls, supermarkets, boxes of horses are a fun and delicious "net red shop" in many consumers' eyes, and even intermediaries have the concept of "box room".
Online power platforms and sub-line retailers have advantages and disadvantages, and consumers appear in multiple channels, so both sides are trying to make a full-source model.
Industry believes that in the context of consumption upgrading, the number of stores in 2018 will be growing.
And the box horses have been exploring more consumption from their originals, and there is a sign of more innovation in retail markets in the new year.
"For example, the business model that combines online and offline, attracts consumers' eyes, and the fresh supermarkets are called " .
"But these relationships are more talk, no more show, and finally, if you've brought a good experience to consumers, and I'm willing to pay for it. "
In the view of CEO Yuan Bin, the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed and the demand for purchase has changed.
It turns out that the line is broken, the line is broken, the line is to defeat the line, the line is under the back line, and now we're holding hands together, because consumers are no longer separated from the line.
Capital competition is a great deal of new retail gunpowder, which is currently represented by fresh supermarkets.
Analysis suggests that the competition for new retailing in first-line cities is far from the pattern of the Red Sea, and that there is still a large number of second-line cities to be dug, and that the market still has great opportunities and space.
Different types of industries for new retail layouts will bring new retail development into a diverse state of development.
The China Institute of Economics and Strategy, together with the China Institute of Social Sciences, has combed a dry product, the annual development report of the Chinese electrician in the sun.
What kind of report card did the Chinese electrician have made this year?
What are the trends in global electricians?
Let's get this straight.
The total sales volume is broken and the speed of the record is back in the acceleration orbit.
Since 2006, our online retail sales have been showing hypervelocity growth, and it's probably fresh at that time, and it's cool to buy things without going out!
However, since 2013, online retail growth began to drop to less than 50 per cent, for the first time in 2015, and the rate of growth in 2016 became 26.2 per cent.
But this year, the online retail volume has accelerated, and in January-September this year, the rate of growth rose to 34.2%.
Much higher than in 2015, 2016 growth rate.
Maybe we're all going around and find it more fun to buy and buy.
Of these, online retailing of goods in kind is nearly $508 trillion, and services are almost $149 trillion.
The share of total retail sales of social goods reached 13.6 per cent, an increase of nearly 3 percentage points over the same period.
Don't sleep, class. Focus. Service online retail is a great success!

Helps you avoid the company becoming the next start-up company.
Amy Erett tried to investigate the happiness of her employees at her e-commerce start-up company, but it didn't work.
The responses are often unknown, unhelpful, and even worse, there's a fraudulent response.
Even if she promised to be anonymous, some employees still don't trust the process.
Erett manages 75 people in San Francisco e-commerce care company Madison Reed, who said, "The response received is not consistent and objective."
So she called for help.
A new group of human resources start-ups emerged like spring after rain, helping companies understand how employees feel.
They build and authorize software dedicated to measuring staff participation, thus enabling companies to conduct rapid polls for specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaints hotlines for employees and, in some cases, to bypass the executive directly report to the board.
"Now, you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company's Fitbit?" Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Redwood City Enterprise, Glint, said that the Glint software analysis tool was used by companies to measure staff professionalism.
Erett said that in three years she had gained more insight into the ideas and feelings of her staff with Glint.
In addition to the rapid investigation and poll of a particular team, Glint provides company hot maps, which are the most complaints, which managers approve low scores and see why.
Companies began to realize that they had to control the company ' s working culture so that they would not be the next step.
For start-ups like Glint, the company's oversight desire is a very expensive business opportunity.
According to the Financial Technology Analysis website Let's Talk Payments, by 2020, global governance, regulatory and compliance industries may have value more than $118.7 billion.
Convercent, a start-up company in Denver, Colorado, works to help companies prevent and detect bad behavior, and they saw an increase in interest and activity in this area during the loss of reputation earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Abby, Microsoft and Tesla.
Euto recently signed up to become a client.
Like Glint, Convercent can send customized "diagnosis" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, view the heat maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also offers anonymous text messages to report bad behavior by employees.
If the chairman is involved, the complaint will enter the board directly.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent, said, "The public opinion court has taken over the authority of the regulatory authority.
If a company is found to treat employees bad or immorally, even if the regulators are not involved, it may face high consequences of consumer resistance, loss of employees and involvement in litigation, as Quinlan stated.
Ruby Tuesday, a catering chain that runs over 500 places and has more than 25,000 employees, has used Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees understand work guidelines and work protocols and provide easy access to contact company headquarters.
Before that, if employees want to report questions, they must find the company's headquarters phone number or e-mail, make a formal complaint and hope that Headquarters will take it seriously.
It's often a scary and disturbing experience, as Ruby Tuesday's legal adviser James Vitlano said he didn't think there was a good way to track staff complaints.
But now the company uses Convercent to detect and solve problems that were previously unknown by executives in remote offices, cities or states -- such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage behaviour.
"I can learn the work experience closer, 360 degrees," said Vitrano of Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation. "
Quinlan stated that after Andorran accounting firm collapsed as a result of the security scandal that violated ethical norms, companies began to focus more on ethics, values and staff professionalism since 2002.
But it was not until "social media entered its own world" that companies realized they couldn't stop their explosions from spreading on the Internet.
" Before using technology to monitor ethics, people see hope as a strategy," he said.
Glint and Convercent both provide their software as services and charge companies for regular costs for use of products.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by venture investors who have supported these two start-ups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with total capital rising to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, with a total of $6 million.
Given the relevance of companies, culture and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
More and more research shows that today's employees expect more than they used to be in the workplace.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high pay and interesting projects are just bets.
The employees want to feel they're accepted, valued, they spend their time on a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company, feel their voices are heard, their work is useful, they will be more committed to making the company succeed," said Nina McCartney, Vice President of Global Welfare and Staff Experience. LinkedIn also uses Convercent and Glint software.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies perform well; companies perform well in their staff loyalty and professionalism.
If third-party analytical tools commit to increasing staff loyalty and professionalism, they'll find financial support.
According to workplace cultural experts, it is important to have data on staff professionalism.
But these data are useless unless the manager of the company takes action.
In fact, if a company requires feedback from its employees, it can be expected to change.
If change is not moving fast enough, or without any progress, it may bring disappointment and lead to employees leaving the company.
Russell Ras, the consulting manager of the business management company Kurt International, said, "If you want to seek 4000 suggestions, then you need to be ready for 400 conversations." He saw some companies over-dependent on data collection errors.
"Because if you don't follow up on the whole way, the staff would think, "Do you really hear what I said?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I care?"
Erett says Madison Reed is now conducting monthly staff surveys and can act on the day of the Glint report.
After collecting feedback from staff on their frustration with the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, she can solve problems by reorganizing the internal team of the company and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is getting new insights into its employees, and in the long run they want to make a shift in this industry known for high brain drain rates and better retain their employees.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you'll lose your talent," said Vitlano.
"If you lose your talent, you lose your client.
And when you lose your client, you lose the company."

NCAA cancelled training twice a day and extended the daytime training of the Bears
At 11:00 p.m., UCLA football team members wandered around the team's new campus practice.
Some players have taken off their sweatshirts and show up the first day of the camp trying to train and sweat their backs.
For a large part of the team, the few minutes of free time are rest.
The players who take the summer course will return to the dormitory for the final exam after three hours of practice, and then the next morning at 6:30 a.m., they will return to the Wasserman football center for the meeting.
"The next three days are a grinding of these guys," said Jim Mora, the bear coach, on Monday, is about to enter Tuesday.
NCAA cancelled two exercises a day (to reduce the burden of players), but actually extended their daytime training - at least before Friday.
That's why the first three trainings at UCLA are scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to fit the schedule of players that have been squeezed.
From canceling training twice a day to more training once a day, the Bears trained almost a week before the last season, Mora trained at summer school for the first time in six seasons in Westwood.
They plan to start 18 trainings on August 20th, and then start preparing for the first war in Texas farmers in September.
Mora said he supported the NCA rule adjustment, although it would add another project to the busy trip of the players.
"In three or four days, we'll give them huge training, very challenging," Mora said.
"They just passed. They're grinding, they're all great kids.
I think we'll have more time on Saturday. It's really great."
As soon as the camp ends, UCLA will stop training. Given the clear view of the nearby parking lot and Luskin Center, it's not an easy task.
From this weekend, the Bears will be staying at the hotel, but Mora admits that once these rooms are empty in the season, there may be problems.
"We'll take security measures," Mora said.
"It's a really worrying question... that someone might rent a room and sit in the room to record the training scene, and that's not a big idea.
If you have a training tape, it's pretty good.
But we'll take security measures there, and we'll take security measures in parking lot 8.
We'll use the resources available to do the best.
I'm not worried too much about that.
We've got plans. "
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the value of housing across Australia increased by 1.5 to 2 per cent, an increase of 3.5 per cent per year, with a minimum annual increase since March 2013.

IT House reported this morning that the Wall Street Journal reported that AT&T had cancelled plans to sell Chinese flagship smartphones in the United States.
Wigand announced the partnership on CES this week, and AT&T cancelled it at the last minute.
In response to this situation, China responded to journalists on January 9, local time in the United States, China will publish new products and specific listing information to the United States market.
Wigand said that for the last five years, China has proven his strength by launching high-end products in the global and American markets.
According to earlier IT House, China will release a "best cell phone you've never heard of" at the CES exhibition in Las Vegas on the afternoon of January 9, and the cell phone's ability to sustain two days of use.
The industry generally believes that China is about to launch this flagship phone, which carries the Android Oreo system, Mate 10 Pro.
The film "I'm not Pan Jinlian" by Van Ice, Guo Tao, Tai Peng, Zhang Jia, etc., will be released throughout the country on September 30th.

Facebook will introduce fact-checking to combat false news.
Facebook claims on Thursday that more potential pranks will be sent to third-party testing agencies and show the results below the original post. Facebook, the largest online social network in the world, is trying to hit the so-called false news.
Facebook stated in its statement on its website that Facebook would start using updated machines to learn to detect possible pranks and send them to fact-checkers and may show the results of the facts below the original post.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main points of dissemination of so-called false news, and many people thought Facebook affected the 2016 presidential election.
This issue has also become a major political topic in Europe, and before the French presidential election in May, voters experienced a spread of false stories, while Germany first passed support for the fine scheme before the September election, and if social media networks fail to remove hate posts in a timely manner, they will be fined.
Facebook stated in a separate German statement on Thursday that a new fact verification function test was being initiated in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
In a blog, Sarah Sue, Facebook News Feeding Product Manager, said, "In addition to seeing stories being questioned by third-party fact-checkers, people want more background to help them make informed decisions about reading and sharing.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its "related article" function and make other changes to its news summary to reduce false news.
A drawing novel: The story of the castle of England.
Recently, the little Scottney Castle became the lead in a compressed music film and once became Mrs. Margaret Thatcher's refuge in the '80s.
But Scottney witnessed 700 years of turmoil in a comfortable position in the Bela Canyon in Kent, and now it's the inspiration for graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes.
"You can see the handwriting of the ancients 300 years ago, and I found it beautiful." He said with all his eyes.
"What kind of human fate is this to leave this letter in my hands."
Through the Middle Ages until Edward, the "A Castle of England" recorded the families of Scottney, each of which was made by different stories, and future British artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Roz's first book with archives as raw materials: he also wrote "The Teeth and Other Story of Dead 2014", a book inspired by the British Library literature, a work he's done with uncontrollable creative passion.
He said, "I'm seeing the thumb mark on the side of the letter, which will not contain my writing impulses, written by a double agent working for Jacobs in the 18th century."
"That's his fingerprints!
And the letters smell like smoke, because then you needed a light to light.
For us 300 years later, it makes people feel like they're around us.
Oh, I love archives!"
For those who are moved by old paper, it seems wonderful to have been supported by the National Trust and Arts Council of England and living in the castle for almost four months.
Roz spent days visiting Victoria's "new" castle, looking through files, studying many treasures and old games at the estate, such as hyena heads hanging on walls, and bottles that spent centuries in the moat.
He walks on the land and ruins of the old castle, talking to the homeless, gardeners, sometimes with illustrations for his book.
And then at night, he'll "Drink whiskey and write."
Scotty's secret history is not clear yet, because the National Trust only entered after Elizabeth Hersi, the last heir in 2006.
Ten years later, when Roz arrived, the staff started processing the files, and he described them as "the nobles left hundreds of years ago: "Oh, put it in the attic."
The diary, a letter from the British Empire, depicts maps of the national boundaries: "You'll think land disputes will be boring," Rhodes says, "But two families will fight for a white tree.
Let go, guys!"
Some of the stories in this work began with castles, and have entered a broader level of study of British history, including The Laborer, which led to a man who left the new castle to participate in the 1381 farmer uprising.
"The story of Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in the book recorded a riot in the castle in 1380, as Roz said.
"The farmer uprising began in that area, and I think it was a good place to launch the uprising.
Maybe there's a connection between these two?"
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of castles, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit priest for seven years during the British religious reform.
Or The Smuggler, the story's owner is Arthur Darrell, 18th century smuggler, who was considered to have a funeral for himself by filling a coffin with stones.
The Darrells is Roz's favorite Scottney Castle family: "These gentlemen seem to be scoundrel, always borrowing money and spending money for what they can't afford.
A generation of Darrell men solve their debt problems by marrying rich old women, and I think they should be a bunch of handsome boys who know how to pursue women. "
As his mission ended in the castle, Rhodes started looking for other strange writing experiences.
He finished a drawing novel in the wilderness of Finland for two weeks, about "El?m?nm?nm?ki," which was an early 20th century sanatorium, which was slowly abandoned.
But Scotty has a special position for him.
"I left sadly," he said.
"It's like, "Oh, I have to face the real life of the cake."
According to journalists, the Chinese smart car team is based in Chuhai and is run by the Executive Vice President of China Communications, Wengo.
Large energy companies are rich and hostile, so who's the best of the many energy companies around the world?
Yesterday, the famous PFC Energy Corporation announced the top 50 ranking of the listed energy company in 2011, and the American oil and gas producer ExxonMobil was a champion of $46.3 billion in market value, followed by Chinese oil and the Royal Dutch Shell.
In this PFC list, Chinese oil was questioned twice in 2007 and 2009, and the top of the other years was occupied by ExxonMobil.
Of the 50th list in 2011, three companies from the Mainland of China were in the ring, and in addition to the second-ranked Chinese oil, there were ninth Chinese petrochemicals and 15th Chinese marine oil.
According to PFC statistics, however, despite the current oil prices far higher than four years ago, the CEO of PFC Energy stated that there were many reasons for the low total market value, mainly the decline in gas prices in North America and the low activity of the global stock market.
According to Xinhua, the heavy pollution weather in Kyoto and the surrounding area has increased further from 16th to 19th.
United States changes the Green Card Regulation
The media quoted President Donald Trump's speech that the United States would launch a new immigration plan to amend the green card regulations.
The plan is intended to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 people per year, temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications will be subject to stricter regulations.
The new regulations were proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in both houses.
The American media quoted Trump as saying, "This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save taxpayers billions of dollars and achieve the benefits by changing the way the United States pays green cards to other citizens.
The law will replace the current programme and reduce chain migration.
This new application process is conducive to English speaking, financial support and applicants with skills in economic development ... "

And in 2017, Zhao Ray said, " After next year's tour, I want to clean myself up and then sink and write more new works."
To optimize the landscape environment and build beautiful South China, recently, the South China Tobacco Agency (sub-company) 636 volunteer service team launched an environmental campaign "Ride Forest, Home Care".
The event was supported not only by all the cadres of the District Tobacco Agency, but also attracted retired senior cadres, and the families of employees were involved in environmental practices, and the young and young men worked together to climb the forest, clean up the garbage, and dedicated their strength to build "Beautiful South China".
The volunteer campaign, which aims to protect the resources of the South China Landscape, promote the concept of "Care for others, Care for Society, Care for Nature", also allows the next generation to receive fumigation from childhood to inherit the virtue of volunteerism.
According to the information received, since its inception in early April this year, 16 members have been developing members, and have been conducting a series of volunteer activities such as smoking farmers to care for tobacco leaves, the Yaan earthquake love donations, and become a volunteer force that conveys positive energy.

Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be careful.
Just as you think 2017 won't be weirder, the sex robot field released a new technology development report.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) released a report looking forward to the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Shaki, Professor of Honorary Retired in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously.
The customer can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the nipple shape and the nail type.
Shaki said in his new report, "People laugh behind their backs, but big companies did launch a lot of sex robots, and we'll see more."
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots, they have silicone skin, touch warm, and use artificial intelligence to set human sexual reactions.
Users can also "defined" their robots to satisfy their preferences, from eye color, nipple shape to nail type or color.
But even more disturbing, many robots with personality make "replicating a wife" look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robots can be defined according to what users think are attractive, such as shyness.
And Roxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion, which pre-set character features, including a little shy "cold Fara" and "The Wild Wendy" with a little shame.
"Roxxy Gold has the same personality as possible, "True Companion's website is as happy as possible.
So she loves you, and she loves you evil.
She had a little mood like normal people in those days!
She can be lazy, talkative, or "sex"!
The rise of sex robots has caused a lot of disturbing -- not just to replace real human relationships -- but also the female identity of bowing down and rape hints on the cold-sweet Fara.
True Companion compared Roxxy to a man's vibrating stick on its website.
The site says, "If a woman has a vibrating stick, why can't a man have Roxxy?"
But these sex robots are not a simple love, they're not just a sex toy.
Their emergence and growing maturity point to the darker, deeper part of our culture: from perfect gender equality to sex with subjudice as an additional option.
Of course, most men don't have sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more popular, they are still on the edge of consumer culture.
But what's coming from the edge will show us the process of our time.
Many people are not weird or aggressive until the free market gives them the chance to become.
These fine sex robots appear in an era where women's rights are threatened, and it's not a coincidence that the White House has a president bragging about sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the TV show "Story of the Girl" is not about the real picture, not the body that hanged, it's not the eyes that were dug out, but the extra real imagination.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but it doesn't look far away now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to do everything possible to create the most real female body (although in the proportion of porn stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have human touch and imitate real human movements.
But to be honest, their personality doesn't represent real women.
They can't break up, they can't run away.
They have no help agencies, no follow-up stories, no independence at all, and there is no possibility of breaking the complete slavery fantasy.
In other words, they're fun slaves.
Or according to the general saying of 2017, the maid.
The Great Wall tells the story of a Chinese elite force fighting the beasts on the world's famous Wall in ancient times.
The last issue of the "Run Bar Brothers" season has been recorded, and Deng is on May 30th, and Shenyang's journalist's micro-mail interview, from "Run Man" to "The Bad Man" and "The Bad Man" Chen Moe, and Deng gave the audience the impression of the "Big Star King."
Deng said, "In the show, I won't do the same thing, keep updating."
Trump's great work?
Make Mitt Romney a microcosm of common sense.
Political differences have led to the polarization of American voters, and micro-spectrums have destroyed American family harmony, which is no wonder for the Trump era.
Before Christmas and Thanksgiving, the major American newspapers were filled with fear of how to deal with the Trump relatives in the comment column.
Usually, we're doing everything we can to break our filter foam.
Less comment is that Trump has brought his family together.
I mentioned this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, who has long been in harmony with our Republicans, is coming to New York this week to visit me.
She reminded me that united against the common enemy could have a strong effect.
Because of working with Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, even Republican relatives who have been fighting for decades, are suddenly and strangely on the same line.
If it's all at the table, it's certainly a good thing, but it's a shock to me that it's a big risk from a broader perspective.
Although left figures have been encouraged by Trump, the warp effect of his presidency has driven us all to the right.
When we talk about normalization and Trump, we mean the possibility of concern that his weird behavior may stop one day.
However, there is a more worrying long-term scenario that Trump's "normal" relationship with right-wing Republicans, who had previously opposed Mr. President's standards and suddenly seemed a symbol of reason.
I found myself missing a little bit of the weirdness of the Mitt Romney edition: putting dogs on cars, 14% of income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), which seem to be too slight compared to Trump.
After the Trump era, the next Republican candidate needs to be rationally qualified for an incalculable improvement.
When my cousin lived in town, we took the kids to the spin horse in New York Park, the largest rotary horse run by the New York Central Park Management, and if you don't need coffee, these three-dollar tickets are the most expensive in this city.
The sound of a wooden horse is as loud as thunder, and the central cylinder is designed for fibreglass, all clowns and animals are twisting their heads, and the horrors look at their shoulders, and the music that sounds strangely.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: from the landscape overlooking in high buildings, the skylines become too familiar that they can't provide much excitement, and the reality of the city does not support dreams.
Thirty-five years later, I haven't completely forgotten that day, I found out that this Swiss cabin was not a Swiss cabin, but a special bar, Ye Olde Swiss Cotton, but near a intersection in northern London.
However, the rotation horse in Central Park is still a magical experience, and everyone has fun for two two children, an 11-year-old child, and four girls in 40s.
If I could evaluate the carousel, I'd give it a full score, but fortunately nobody asked.
But this week at a department store, before I brushed my credit card, I was asked to score my deal with "exposure" one to five stars.
In the coffee shop in the corner of my street, and you can choose to score 15% of the tip, which is to buy things on the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down the speed of supposed to be neutral transactions, but also putting pressure on the waiter to add personal factors to what is not needed.
The poor woman in the department store laughed sorry, and I was exhausted, and the credit card deal experienced five stars.
Oscar Pistolis transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain.
This is the second time that Pistolis left the prison to the hospital.
Last year he was taken to the hospital to treat the wrist cut, and the prison officially claimed that he fell in the cell.
After the prosecutor appealed the initial miskilling decision, Pistolis was murdered.
At Valentine's Day 2013, he shot Stingkamp several times through the toilet door to his house in Pretoria until he died.
Pistolis claims to have mistakenly thought that his girlfriend was hiding in the compartment at night.
The prosecutor has declared their intention to appeal again, this time for six years' imprisonment against Pistolis, who believe that the sentence is too kind.
The National Prosecutor ' s Office has indicated that an appeal will be filed with the Supreme Court of South Africa and that this appeal may be heard this year.
If the prosecutor wins, Pistolis will face a 15-year sentence.
South Africa has no death penalty.

Two Bulgarians detained in Greece for illegal camping
bTV quoted information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of 1 August, the Sisonia police detained a group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians.
The detainees were released that day and the investigation was still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed to bTV that two Bulgarians were subsequently released.
The Greek authorities have strengthened control over random camping and would impose a huge fine for any person who rests in non-designated camps.
The patrol will last a season.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated that the court may be fined by random campers.
On May 18th, the Ministry of Finance announced the "Special Award for Industrial Enterprise Structural Adjustment Management" which will arrange special awards to promote the resolution of coal, the excess capacity of the steel industry, with a total of $100 billion.
Recently, several local governments, such as Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Heilong River have been making reforms on the resolution of excess capacity.
Many of these provinces even suggested that central finance be actively seeking financial support for their provinces ' de-capacity.
One proof is that the coal capacity target published in only eight provinces stands at 90% of the national coal reduction programme.
In an interview with a journalist, Limboqiang, Director of the China Energy Policy Institute at Xiamen University, believes that the steel and coal industry's "de-capacity" depends on only $100 billion in central terms, and that more money requires local governments and businesses to solve it.
The recent rules for the implementation of coal de-production in Shanxi Province proposed the restructuring of the Shanxi Coal Group into a State-owned capital investment company, restructuring the assets and operations of the enterprise and building a new business model.
Before the actual funding gap could be three times as high as the subsidy, the Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, Yoon U-min, stated that the initial statistics were "departure" of 1.3 million employees and that the steel system was 500,000.
The Southern Daily News (Reporter/She Qingyu) was informed today from the Provincial Environmental Protection Department that the results of the credit rating for environmental protection from priority sources of pollution in Guangdong Province were being published in 2012.
After assessment, 134 of the 1251 enterprises listed on the environmental credit management list were not rated for the reasons of the cut-off, unaccepted, closed, etc.
And among the red companies, there are more heavy pollution companies such as electroplating, dyeing, prevention and control, and some sewage treatment plants are also listed.
The Department of Environmental Protection has stated that, in order to reflect the principles of openness, equity, justice and public supervision, the ratings are now publicized on the EPA website.
During the publicity period, the Environmental Protection Department received public calls, letters, visits, etc., reflecting problems, and the Office will investigate, verify and address the issues reflected.
Climate change could destroy a large number of species in an irreversible manner, including those that humans depend on to survive.
Waynes says that even if heat doesn't kill species directly, it can create potential risk factors.
The Waynes study also shows that local extinction varies from region to region, and that the probability of local extinction of tropical species is one times higher than the temperature zone.

"The garbage cannot be thrown by hand, put it in the trash can, high-altitude dumps are dangerous, and good homes need to be created together."
Yesterday, 11-year-old Rose Rain and Mom came to the Three Gorges Square while picking up the garbage around him, sending a bill to the past pedestrians, hoping to raise awareness of the environment.

Does meat, dairy products and chocolate help to alleviate inflammation intestinal disease (IBD)?
The meat and chocolate may sound like your digestive system nightmare.
But a new study shows the opposite: diet rich in meat protein and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms associated with inflammation intestinal diseases.
The disorder has a life impact of about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 British, leading to stomach spasms and abdominal swelling, constant or bleeding diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at Washington University usually recommend that patients avoid eating meat and dairy products to mitigate symptoms, but researchers find that key amino acid-colour amino acid-colour amino acid in proteins helps to promote immunocell growth, which increases the resistance of the intestinal tract.
Dr. Marco Colona, Principal Researcher, explained that immunocells patrol the intestinal tract to ensure that harmful microorganisms hidden in food do not quietly enter the body.
The cells that cause inflammation and the cells that promote tolerance remain balanced, protecting the body without damage to sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
When the balance is too biased towards inflammation, there can be inflammation intestinal disease.
In the experiment, a cell that promotes immunity appears in mice carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria need color amino acid (one of the components of protein) to form the appearance of cells.
Professor Colona said, "We have established a link between a bacterial population (Roy's milk, which is the normal part of the intestinal microbicide) and the development of a cell population that promotes resilience.
The more color amino acid intakes in mice in their diet, the more immune cells they are.
He suggested that if humans used the same method, the combination of ludicative lactation and colored amino acid diets could create a more resistant, less inflammable intestinal environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studied an immune cell that could increase resilience, when she found a group of study mice having such cells, but the other group of same bacteria was raised separately.
She suspects that this difference is related to the intestinal microbes of mice.
DNA sequenced for mice' cholesterol, and found that there were six bacterial species in mice with immunocells, but not in mice without immunocells.
Rats are raised in sterile environments, so they lack intestinal microorganisms and do not have this immune cell, and the presence of Lucella produces immunocells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers develop Lucella in liquids and then move small quantities of non-bacterial liquids to premature immunocells separated from mice.
The immunocell developed into a resistant cell.
When the active ingredient is pured from the liquid, it can be proved that the active ingredient is a by-product of color amino acid metabolism, known as thorium-3-lactation acid.
When researchers double the amount of color amino acid in mice feed, the number of cells has increased by about 50%, but when the level of color amino acid is halved, the number of cells has been halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Baragan explained that people, like rats, have the same resistance cells, most of us have Lucella in our gastrointestinal tract.
Can humans induce cell development by-products from Lucerella like the experimental mice, which are not known yet, but genetic defects associated with color amino acid are found among patients with inflammation intestinal diseases.
She said, "These cells may be the result of what we want, because they control the inflammation of the intestinal surface.
In fact, the high-level chromosomal amino acid that exists in the Lucella could lead to an increase in the number of bacteria.
José Mulligno thinks Man has signed the Genius Nemania Matitch.
Wednesday night, after the first appearance of the Sampdolia confrontation, Mulligno decided that Man had signed a genius mid-field player.
Matitch, from Chelsea, signed up to 40 million pounds, playing 2-1 in Dublin's last pre-season game before the European Super Bowl in Royal Madrid, winning Paul Bogba and Andreas Pereira's favor.
However, in the pre-Bruce Asian tour, Matitch was in a very poor state, and only 45 minutes was completed, and Mulligno admitted that it needed to be improved before the British Super season began.
"He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and genius thinking -- he thinks football," Murigno says.
"We'll help him get ready as soon as possible."
Mulligno started to arrange his first formation at the beginning of the season, and like Matitch, the new contractors Victor Lindlov and Romelu Lucacu started the game at Injehua Stadium.
The independent newspaper reported this week that Mulligno still wanted to introduce three more contractors, but he insisted that the club was "excellent," and that he had four first-choice signers in his heart, and three of them had been introduced.
"The club introduced three of the contractors, and I appreciate it." He added.
"If the club could bring in all four players, I would be happier, but they've done a lot for me."
Will China fall behind without building this type of warship?
With the recent publication of the new frigate construction plans by the world's major naval powers, as if the frigates were the focus of the major naval forces overnight, first, Japan identified the procurement of two new frigates in the 2018 defence budget, which finally made a substantial breakthrough in the Japanese DEX frigate programme, followed by the recent release of the latest programme of the United States FPG frigate programme by Lockheed Martin in the United States, where is the new frigate in China?
With the landing of a new 054A frigate in late 2017, marking the construction of up to 29 of the 054A frigates, which has come closer to the sum of the 053H series of frigates, while the first 054A in 2006 has been under water, and the construction of 054A has been built for 12 years, even worldwide, with so many high-performance general frigates built, except China, only the United States of America's "Perry" class frigates built in the 1970s and 1980s.
And the reason for building so many 054A is simple, it's good, it's good, and it's added to the Navy's debt for years.
The 054A frigate has been favoured by the Chinese Navy for many years with higher value and good combat power, carrying a 76-mm main cannon, 32 units of sea red flag-16 and fish-8 anti-submarine missiles, eight eagles hit 83 and a straight-9 helicopter, which, although built in 2006, was designed earlier, but its combat force was not too poor even if it was placed in today, and the world's frigate could reach the medium level.
But after all, this is a ship designed at the beginning of the twenty-first century, with a large gap between power systems and electronic radar equipment than the current world mainstream frigate, and the same type of frigate in Europe is already equipped with full power, small multi-purpose phase-controlled radar, large-sized helicopter decks, and it's time to develop new models.
So how the new Chinese frigate should develop, which is directly related to its future positioning and our Chinese Navy strategic approach.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will be a complete Bluewater Navy, and the future will be towards the ocean, with the rapid deployment of areas of China's interest, showing the existence of force and, if necessary, to ensure that China’s full interests in the region are not damaged, so that the new Hu Weijiang will develop towards a large scale and oceanization.
And look at the location of the new frigate in the future Chinese naval sequence, and the future Chinese Navy should be similar to the United States Navy, other main ships, except for the necessary offshore defence vessels, will form a carrier combat group or amphibious attack ship, as required.
The role of the new frigate should serve as a position for anti-submarine and air-free areas in future carriers, which should serve as a frigate category in the amphibious attack ship strike group, so that the new frigate must have a strong anti-submarine and a good medium-range airing capability, based on such needs.
Based on the above positioning, it is bold to imagine the future of the national frigate.
First, there will be a significant increase in drainage relative to the current 054A frigate, with an estimated new frigate discharge of about 5,000-6000 tons; the power system will use an integrated power thrust system of QC280 improved gas turbines and two diesel engines, with a maximum speed of around 30 knots and a significant increase in the re-entry capacity; until weapons are equipped with 76 mm main cannons and 1130 near-proof guns should be retained, but a red flag 10 launch system will be added, and a 32-48 unit red flag improvement 16 red flag improvement and fish-8 co-emergence system should be installed after the formation of a large 8-16 unit of large-scale launch systems for launch eagles and new types of cruisers and 18-ton aircraft, which should also be used to launch eagles and 18-ton aircraft, which should also be used in the light of the four-ton fixed-line radar system, which should also be used in the light of the four-ton aircraft.
The overall level of the new frigate will reach the world's current level, not even compared to the US FPG.
Of course, the concept is just a guess of the new frigate in the country, and we can only wait until the new frigate goes in. Let's look forward to it.

In recent years, our city has encouraged companies to participate actively in the construction of national, industry standards and regional group standards, giving $300,000 in awards to enterprises that are mainly or involved in the development of standards for Zhejiang manufacturing groups, and an award of $500,000 for enterprises certified through Zhejiang branding, which is the highest amount of the award in the province, and has inspired the enthusiasm for corporate participation in the target.
A few days ago, Wang Li Group Production Workshop, the head of the group system, was packing a security door box with its staff as a sample of the Zhejiang manufacturing group standard-to-standard compliance, ready to be sent to the Shao Xing Quality Testing Centre.
Just the other day, Wang Li passed the Zhejiang Manufacturing Accreditation Group.
According to Gao Ken, a professional team of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations praised the group ' s achievements in the core aspects of excellence, autonomous innovation, and agreed that it would be a complete match, and that, as long as the product was tested, Wang Li would be one of the first enterprises to pass through that standard.
The Wang Li Group is just a microcosm of the transformation of the standard industry.
We're also working on the standards of Zhejiang manufacturing groups in parallel with it, and we're also working on the Zhiyang, the group.
Since the Zhejiang manufacturing team standard set by our city's security door industry last year, Star Moon, New and New Industries have actively applied for docking.

The Chinese household debt rate is close to the United States, and it's worse than not buying a house?
In recent times, we have been discussing recent changes in real estate policy, and is real estate policy loose again? Will the diversity of land policy supply subjects have led to a decline in housing prices?
But when we were worried about real estate prices, about macroeconomic regulation, and fear of future trends in the real estate market, the People's Daily wrote again, and the last time we specifically discussed the rules of the People's Daily comment on real estate regulation, and now the People's Daily is about a more serious topic than buying a house, and that's even if you can afford a house, and you can afford debt even if you can afford a house?
Today, we'll talk about more serious issues than buying a house: paying off.
First, China's growing housing debt crisis
According to the data from the Chinese Social Institute of Social Sciences, the National Financial and Development Laboratory of China, the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the China Institute of Social Sciences, the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the China Institute of Social Sciences, the National Assets Balance Sheet Research Centre, published by the National Assets Balance Sheet Research Centre, noted that the leverage rate in the residential sector remained rising, from 47.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6 per cent in the third quarter, an increase of 1.3 percentage points, an increase of 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The population sector ' s debt share in the entire real economy has increased and leverage has increased faster.
Research shows that Chinese households ' liabilities in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, or about two thirds of residential liabilities, about twice as much as operating loans.
Of these, in consumer loans, the medium- and long-term loans dominated by housing loans account for about 80%, but from incremental terms, short-term consumer loans grew faster than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition to this, the household debt rate in China only counts the total credit received by the family sector from financial institutions, while Chinese households have a large number of private borrowings, including borrowing money from relatives and friends, with large-scale hidden debt.
Seeing this data is a bit of a surprise, and according to the Suning Institute of Finance, the leverage rate in China was only 3 per cent in 1996 and only 18 per cent in 2008, but since 2008, the leverage rate has begun to show rapid growth since 2008, doubled to 36.4 per cent in just six years.
We compared the data, last May, HSBC released a survey report across nine countries, with respondents approaching tens of thousands.
The report was visited by the Millennium Generation (born 1980-2000) in nine countries.
The report states that China has a 70 per cent housing ownership rate after 80 and 90 years, far ahead of the second Mexico (46 per cent) and twice as high as the United States indicator (35%).
These data tell us a very likely problem, which is that the largest potential "greceros" of Chinese residents at this stage are probably not able to pay off their debts.
Second, why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As our previous analysis, while we've been saying that China's house prices are higher, China's housing ownership rate is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world, then it's not worth buying a house, and I'm afraid you can ask a lot of friends now that you can afford loans?
We look at the world's real estate markets, and the Chinese real estate market has not yet experienced a major real estate crisis, except for the Hainan we said earlier, but the financial tsunami in 2008 was the United States real estate crisis 10 years ago.
The reason for the real estate crisis in the United States was attributed to two rooms: the beauty of the house and the beauty of the premises.
In the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold their houses to low-income people at the time in the United States, and when the United States economy was getting better, the real estate market was also a great deal, but it was not good, and as the US economy had stagnated, causing a decline in income from buyers, and a large amount of household consumption spending began to decline.
But the current situation in the United States was financial assets and real estate assets of the United States family assets, and almost all of the low-income groups in the United States were real estate, while most of the top 20 per cent of the high-income groups were financial assets, and the higher the debt rate of poor people in the United States.
One serious fact is that these people buy houses when they're better economically, so the money paid for mortgages is calculated on their better income, and when income falls, the pressure on mortgages has not decreased, but even because some subprime schemes have become floating, so the real estate problems of these American families have evolved into a crisis of real estate.
So some people started to recover their property because they were too low to pay for mortgages, and when banks took back their property from the buyers who owed loans, they would sell at very low prices, which led to a decline in housing prices in the region, and this process triggered a further decline in the house price, creating a vicious circle, and when the house price fell to a certain extent, and more buyers found that their house value was even lower than their own loans, and more people stopped paying their mortgages and caused more bad debts.
So, a huge vicious circle formed:
"The economy is in a bad mood — a decline in income — some people can't afford mortgages — houses that are sold at low prices by banks — falling in house prices — more people stop paying back mortgages — banks sell — prices fall again..."
And that's not the problem, because the house price continues to fall, and you don't have any debt after you stopped paying off the house, and if the bank auctions the house doesn't get the money you owe the bank, then you still need to pay back the money, simply saying that you bought a $3 million house with a down payment of $600,000, and when the house price fell to the house worth only 2 million, you stopped lending the house to the bank, the bank auction house, and you lost your initial payment of $600,000, but you still have to pay back the bank debt.
So, in such a vicious circle, the US economy gradually collapsed, and eventually triggered the 2008 financial crisis in the United States.
So, the high level of household debt in China at this stage is a matter of great need to be vigilant, which is still below developed countries at present, but the problem has begun to arise, and the country has repeatedly stressed leverage since last year, which is a very prior judgment that the rate of household debt if it is allowed to continue to climb, and therefore prevent the emergence of financial risks.
So the house was used to live, not for fire, and the country would build multiple main supply, multi-channel security, rental and mergers, and further address potential risks.
For our individual families, it is important to abandon real estate speculation, to buy a house, to avoid a huge burden on their families, and only a reasonable assessment of their income and debt levels is a healthy path to family wealth development.

The White House props cost thousands.
According to the military records released by Times, last month the White House decided to transport a Marine helicopter to South Lawn to highlight the great glory of American manufacturing, at a cost of $24,000.
The Green and White Sikorsky VH-3D is a major exhibit in the White House on July 17th, highlighting the American construction project.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pens and senior White House officials visited manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibit is a helicopter made in Connecticut, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
According to records of the first flight of the Force Marine Helicopter (HMX-1) responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House military office requested the helicopter to appear on its daily order (FRAGO), i.e. only 36 hours before the helicopter landed at the South Lawn for the "special" event.
The day before the event, Commander HMX-1 said in an e-mail from the Deputy Commander of the High Marine Flight, "I just want to make sure you know that this event was highly valued."
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive at the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17th for 3 p.m. and left after the lawn was cleared from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. that night.
The information also indicates that in case the departure from the White House is delayed, the return will require a second group of crew members because of the time limit on duty.
The original crew stood by the helicopter during the operation, while the security forces were on standby while the plane was on the ground.
The record of Times magazine does not clearly indicate whether a second crew is needed.
The Hutch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record states that HMX-1 asked if the event had violated the bill.
The commander wrote, "One of the questions we asked was whether it was against the Hatch Act and was told that there was no violation."
"It sounds like you're locked," Deputy Commander replied.
The White House defines this American manufacturing campaign as an official event and is therefore not governed by the Hatch Act.
But even official activities are political.
In the event, the President introduced the issue of the Senate at the time: medical reform and was a great deal of control over government regulations.
It's no new thing to use Marine 1 or Air Force 1 for political propaganda.
The presidents have been asked to travel to these planes.
But it's not common to requisition for photo purposes.
In February, Trump was noticed, when it was in Melbourne, Florida, and the presidential plane slipped slowly, and finally stopped at his background for his first campaign rally, and his Twitter account was full of complaints about the use of the President's plane.
The White House Deputy Press spokesman Lindsay Walters said, "The White House was so excited about the American-made exhibition, which showed products from all 50 states, all of which were made by American workers using American materials."
HMX-1 crews often conduct flight training near Washington and South Lawn, practicing the exact placement of the President of the United States in the White House.
During the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 practiced 58 landings in the White House.
An official claims that this American manufacturing flight is included in the training requirements of this month's crew.
The helicopter force also flew an extra 11 hours of "non-Presidental support mission" that day.
The White House claims that taxpayers did not bear the cost of any other props in the event.
Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in the arrangements for the South Lawn helicopter show.
HMX-1 does not keep the budget records of presidential flights, so it is very difficult to determine the exact costs incurred by the event.
However, according to the hourly costs of the Ministry of Defence for the 2017 fiscal year, VH-3D ' s Department of Defence can be reimbursable at $24,380 per flight hour.
The troops recorded 30 minutes of flight from the base of the Quantico Marines Airport in Virginia.
The White House says the cost of operating the helicopter is much lower than that.
Walters says, "It's very misleading to estimate taxpayers' costs based on reimbursable fees.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many others, including sunk costs in annual allocations.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the cost of reimbursement by the Ministry of Defence does not include personnel costs, but does include oil, maintenance and contractual costs.
At that time, Sean Spike, former White House press spokesman, defended the use of the helicopter.
And it says, "The idea is to show what America made this week,
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, and they've all contributed a force to our national security, and I guess that hundreds of people have to rely on it even without thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the result of countless Americans working hard.
So it's certainly not inappropriate to show that. "
We don't know if Trump interacted with the helicopter while visiting the South Lawn during his activities, but he did get in the fire truck's seat.
In the White House, Trump spoke to the representative of Sikorsky to joke about the company's own plane and the media.
He said, "I know the Sikorsky plane.

According to Market Star, from 2005 to 2011, our GDP rose from the center to the second seat.
But I still have the dilemma of low investment efficiency and lack of core competitiveness in the industrial economy. To this end, the latest issue of the Economic Blue Page of the Provincial Economic Information Centre recommends that the quality and effectiveness of economic growth be improved.
Based on some representative indicators of our provincial economy in 2005 and 2011, it compared with the national and central regions.
In terms of industrial economic efficiency, in 2011, high-energy industries such as industrial energy, raw materials, etc., were affected by market volatility and "dual pressure" overcapacity, while domestic electricity, automobiles, etc., led to low profits.
And a large amount of investment does not bring the corresponding economic benefits, which is an important reason for the quality and low efficiency of economic growth in my province.
In this regard, experts suggest that effective measures be taken to encourage business innovation, and that scientific and technological results in higher education and research institutions should also be "transfer" to the enterprise in a timely manner.
For the low efficiency of the industrial economy, experts say it is also important to actively promote industrial merger restructuring, optimize industrial layout and extend the industrial chain.
