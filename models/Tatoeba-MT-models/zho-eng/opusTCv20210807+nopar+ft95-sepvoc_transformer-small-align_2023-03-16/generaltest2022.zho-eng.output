Is there a way to punish him?
So that's not happening again.
Or how long will the restaurant be ready? Can you ask me?
The students sing the lead at the annual Zhe Da Academic Conference, and the results of the research have opened their brain holes.
Wash your hands with air, judge disease, search for the source of fog, and last night, at the opening of the annual academic conference of Zhejiang University in 2016, a series of academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these results are students, covering various fields of environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities education, and students have created many high-end inventions of applied value, starting with a curious idea, some of which have been awarded internationally.
Biological sensors: your home medical examination doctor
The Ph.D. at the Institute of Biomedicine Engineering, Zhang Diming team, showed a biosensor at the end of a smartphone, only half the size of the smartphone.
"You just need to breathe gently, and this instrument will test your health initially from the gas composition you exhale. "
Zhang Diming introduced that the sensor was connected to smartphones, and when the gas was out, the health report was shown on the phone.
Smart bracelets that can detect health conditions in the market, usually with physical parameters such as temperature, pulse.
And this biosensor uses new materials like graphite, whose target is chemical, sensitive "sniff" to make it more deep and accurately reflect the health of the body.
Smart surgery lights: doctors' high-energy eyes
Besides smartphones, smart surgery lights are used in the operating room.
This invention won the Silver Prize at the 44th International Innovation Fair in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The Master of Optical Sciences and Engineering, Ju Lin Jing, the Shin Jun Fei team opened a new idea in the defects of traditional surgical lights and invented smart LED surgery without shadow lamps.
"A lot of early detection of diseases, not removed, related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room ... "
Shin Jun Fei said that if doctors don't see all the tumor tissues in time when early cancer is examined, then cancer cells will spread.
This smart surgical lamp has four light plates that enhance the difference between different organizations in light by regulating the spectrum.
During the operation, doctors can adjust the size of the light, light level, spectrum, colour evenness and no shadow rate, depending on the needs and personal habits of surgery.
This smart surgical lamp has been tested at the Zhejiang University Medical School Hospital, the Children ' s Hospital at Zhejiang University Medical School, etc., and has received better feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize for the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: save water and cool.
People wash their hands with water, wipe more soap, squeeze some handwash, and Li Kai-chul and others invented an air handwasher.
As long as we stand on the handwasher, we can compress the air.
"It's like a gas tank.
Compressed air, forming fluids at the tap, combined with water.
So we can wash our hands! "
The visible reaction and bacterial residual experiments prove that handwashing in this way is the same as the normal handwashing method.
This device needs to be driven by our own gravity, which ensures the level of washing and saving 90% of water, and the whole process is completely energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the Second Global Major Challenge Summit, the invention emerged from many world top schools and won the only gold prize.
Please arrange for me as soon as possible, thx.
Please cancel the order and return the cash, don't score, and will not be used again.
Bones and spicy pickles are not for kids.
If so, please hurry up.
Not yet. Thank you.
He told me to tell you where he is.
I'm not waiting. Cancel the order.
I bought it, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can you change it?
Or cancel the order.
Okay, please.
A certificate that makes sense -- a first aid certificate.
This is one of the skills I think is important, except for the driver's license!
Universal: First aid is actually emergency relief in case of an emergency, a rescue before the ambulance arrived.
It's known that there was a while after the accident, and it was the most important time.
This is the time to need first aid.
If I really had a heart attack, brain bleeding, breathing stopped, then the window of our lives was only four minutes, gold four minutes!
So people around you know how important first aid is!
When someone falls around us, we can save him through professional knowledge, not just standing there and doing nothing. It's terrible to be helpless.
"In China, our official data die by accident every year, the most dangerous call heart stop.
On average 15% in the United States, it's saved.
Seventy-eight percent of the casino hotels in Las Vegas can be rescued, Shanghai, Beijing is less than 1%. "
That's what Lu Lok said by the first reaction founder.
If a man has a heart attack, a breath is gone, a heart beat is gone, and you're not working.
It has to be artificial breathing, pressure outside the chest to save people.
I found that few people now have this consciousness to learn first aid, but when it happens, it's too late, so call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can react in time in the face of an emergency.
Maybe it'll save a man's life!
The first aid certificate can be signed up at your local Red Cross training centre, and I'm enrolled at the Red Cross Training Centre in Pearl Sea, and the students have a discount.
PS: The last picture is to record the goal you're about to complete before the age of 25, and adding the first aid card to the target list is a few months ago, but it was done!
Then we're going to take another certificate for the test, and I'm going to take a dive certificate, and I've seen a dive first aid certificate in Little Red, which seems to have a first aid certificate to get a test, so it's still useful!
I'm order.
Of which $13 is a shrimp dumpling?
I haven't tried.
What, you don't understand?
One for $13?
Yesterday, the food was leaked, and this time a shrimp dumpling was for me?
Because I saw it working when I entered code.
First, I personally think the Four Seas is a full-scale piece of shit, in every sense.
But if you say this movie isn't a bright spot, it's not at least a good match.
It's a lot of bad pieces, so you can sleep in the cinema, and it's a kind of anger that makes you look like a monkey on the Zephyr Mountain, and it can light your anger in countless ways.
In insulting the audience, Han Chiu is a gift.
The most painful thing about this film is that it's as if it were a creation in a novel, unnamed, so full of holes like a windsuit on pony.
Even after reading it, you'll wonder if there's a metaphor that the director is in it, but when you think about it, it's actually a piece of shit.
Let's just say something I can't understand.
The man's residence should be on an island south, with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow and then the story arranged for a guy in the neighborhood to send her to the northeast to see the snow.
Old people are watching snow in vans from the south to northeast?
He and his father were very relieved about it.
And then the old man didn't have the following.
How did the lady get a license to open a hotel on a abandoned ship?
Why can the island's bike party punks seal a mountain road easily?
Then the truck that delivered the steel bars in the middle of the road parked by the road, and the truck driver couldn't find it.
That's a very obvious prop.
Why would a non-recorded, illegal, mixed-car party become a police officer?
Why didn't you call the police in the movie in the face of the loan shark?
An adult knows how to use smartphones, but he doesn't know how to open a room card in a hotel, and then he can't arrange to find the hotel owner and sit outside the door and sleep outside the room?
This strange plot is filled with the whole film, and it hurts me when I remember them.
Besides the plot, worse is the main theme of the movie, or the film has no main thrust, it's a nasty stitch.
You'll think he wants to make a comedy film at the beginning of the film, and guess it might be an inspiration film in over 20 minutes, and you think it might be a play that's not easy to survive in town, and then you don't know what you've seen, and then you're so suspicious about yourself, why you're going to the cinema to enjoy shit.
For most people, it's actually familiar with the pattern of movies, like if you want to shoot a motorcycleman, then you're gonna be excited + comedy and tell the audience how a talented rookie is moving towards success.
If you want to make a love movie, you'll be honest with the young and waitress girls who like to ride motorcycles.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot be contrary to the normal world.
Like the new bike that Yoon Jung just burned down and can sing, you can't open some brain holes that Kennedy can't even see.
As for the woman who is not retarded to act like a five-year-old in some ways, I don't know if it's an acting or a director's request.
And I don't understand why Han Chiu is so keen to add a crash to his own film?
Is this a movie set in the spring festival to block the audience?

Checking well concrete modules for production and processing equipment
Zhengzhou Yi Xin is a domestic concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment, inspection of well block machinery, a manufacturer of machinery for well wall modules, from semi-automatic to fully automated production lines.
Through years of practice and development, there are now too hard quality, mainly for hydraulic, mobile, fully automated inspection of well series equipment and accessories.
Checking well concrete modules for production and processing equipment.
Check the characteristics and advantages of the equipment for the production of the concrete module of the Zhengzhou well brick module:
Yi Xin checks well-building brick equipment widely applicable to new construction materials for municipal underground construction materials such as coal, heat, water, electricity, gas.
For example, drainage, water storage facilities, various types of inspection wells, rainwater vents, ditches, septic tanks and small constructions, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantage of building the inspection well using concrete modules is that the module is surrounded by a concussion structure around the module, combining the construction of chains.
The wall of the well wall is far more resistant than the construction of the flat friction.
The modules are medium- and empty structures, combined with vertical holes that are integrated, horizontal holes are consistent, and the core is filled, and the current concrete net structure is formed, which acts as a secondary and waterproof effect.
The modules have a twilight, horizontal tectonics, vertical plugs, and the overall strength of the structure.
Also using concrete to check wells, which are not easily collapsed, sinking, leaking, mechanical stability of well wall modules, simple operation, formation size standards.
Concrete check well module brick equipment smart control with data input, output device one-key touch-through liquid crystal shows the entire process of monitoring mechanical operations, achieving ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of ratios, density operations, security logic control and failure diagnostic systems.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall module uses single-cylinder hydraulic pressure, transport, double-cylinder hydraulic pressure, transport.
Independent hydraulic integration stations avoid the reliability of hydraulic systems due to the impact of host vibration on hydraulic systems.
Concrete inspection of well-module module bricks equipment, demodeling of the fabric box, closing of storage box doors, automatic delivery trays, all independently completed by hydraulic systems, thereby reducing mechanical wear and repair.
Concrete inspection well module brick equipment uses imported computers, electrical appliances, sealed hydraulics, and the combined performance of the para-insurance equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical irritation platform for the well wall module uses a whole plate steel, a line cutting model without welding points, which allow the filling box to move freely and to reduce mechanical wear and tear.
Reduce the load of the mold, fill and double-encrypted vibration, integrated, fully synchronized, station vibration, and ensure that the vibration is achieved.
The mechanical vibration machine of the well wall module, the computer automatically controls the vibration based on the price of the raw material, without wear and tear brakes, thereby extending its useful life and reducing costs.
Auto-control and manual control of dual functions of the well wall module.
Check well molds:
The Yi Xin Brick machine checks a cement block table for wells:
The corner of the workshop at Yi Xin:
Inspection of well concrete module production processing equipment
Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment, in addition to producing well blocks, can produce bricks, empty bricks, street bricks.

Chongqing Middle School pilot modern apprentice system.
Yesterday, journalists learned from the City Council that from this year our city will pilot modern apprentice development models in 60 middle schools, with students trained in pilot training, and that the admissions will be pre-recorded as a unit employee after admission to the pilot enterprise.
The Municipal Council requires that the admission to secondary schools and business work procedures be regulated, and to clarify the dual status of students in secondary schools and associate employees of the apprentice, with the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises, which are not 18 years of age, must be signed by apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises, in accordance with the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, apprentices, schools and enterprises, and in accordance with the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises, and to establish specific positions, teaching content, equity security, etc.
Pilot schools are encouraged to jointly conduct pre-service training and transfer training for employees in enterprises in modern apprentice form and cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools need to reform the talent development model.
The school co-designs the talent development programme, the development of professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, standards of business masters, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation programmes.
Pilots are based on the development system as a pilot cycle, with students ' internships in enterprises determined according to the professional development programme, which is generally six months.
In business practice, business grouping management models should be implemented, and according to different professional characteristics, a teacher can bring 2-5 students and form a learning group to ensure that students are skilled in the skills required for each round of training posts.
According to the arrangements, from 2016 to August 2019, we have identified 60 municipal modern apprentices in three groups, each with a total of 3,000 students (a total of 3,000 apprentices).
In accordance with the principle of piloting, the point-to-face step forward, explore the establishment of joint school enrolment, joint development, integrated long-lasting mechanisms for the development of human beings, effective upgrading of student job skills, and improving student-to-peer employment rates and quality of employment.

But no rider went to the store to get the food.
South African doctor: Omikron is very active, but it's mostly light.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the new coronary virus Omega is lighter than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to Associated Press reports that with the spread of the Omikron variant in South Africa, more than 5,000 doctors in Holden Province in South Africa reported that symptoms of the new coronary patients they currently treat are slightly, such as physical pain and cough, similar to influenza.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said he was looking at dozens of patients every day, but no patient needed to be hospitalized.
Pile said: " They can control the disease at home, most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation ... "
He said that this included older patients and those with health problems, which were more likely to suffer from coronary virus infections.
He said, compared to that, in the last wave of Delta, he treated the new coronary patient "respiration difficulties, low blood oxygen levels."
Many people are going to be hospitalized in a few days " .
Within two weeks after the first report in Southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it takes weeks to collect sufficient data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, only 30 per cent of the new coronary patients in recent weeks were severe diseases, half of the previous severe epidemic; the average time of hospitalization was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3 per cent of recent new crown patients died, compared to 20% of the cases that broke early in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, Director of the African Institute of Health, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports: " At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a more moderate disease ... "
He also said, " It's still early, we need to get later data.
Normally, hospital and death occur late, and we only have two weeks to enter the epidemic ... "
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effects of the current vaccine and treatment.
Although Delta is still the world's main new coronary virus plant, the Omega case is emerging in dozens of countries, of which South Africa is the centre of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases discovered in Holden province increased by 400% in the first week of December, and tests show that Omikron variants account for more than 90 per cent.
Thank you for the supporters today. 80 boxes are all out!

Education: What is it to save abducted children?
If it's more than a famous public service ad without "no sale, no killing," in a good environment without "receiving" needs, crowd-proofing, popular counter-trading, making trafficking unprofitable, risky, high cost, and such crimes will not happen repeatedly.
Recently, the Ministry of Public Security's Criminal Investigation Bureau has been launched on the emergency distribution platform for child disappearances developed by the Ministry of Public Security.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish authoritative channels for information on the disappearance of children and to recover abducted children in a timely manner.
I heard this App is called "Reunification," and it's warm.
New technologies are not only called "art" but full of love, but also properly used, practical, effective.
The primary objective of trafficking in law enforcement is to find the children abducted and protect their physical safety and freedom.
Second, the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list a lot of "large words".
But before the trafficking case is resolved, priority should be given to the safety of the victim.
The matter is a matter of urgency, with urgent "help" purposes, a wide range of talk, such as "the child trafficking should be the death penalty" and the subject of greater controversy, which can be suspended and carefully discussed; but not to save the children abducted.
Based on the investigation of such cases, vendors are used to stay away from the crime as soon as possible after they have been able to do so.
One more minute delay in the search, and the child may be a step further away from parents, and the difficulty of finding a case increases by one point.
In this case, it is a practical action to take out such a direct help to solve cases and find out effective ways of finding a child.
After all, "trading" is a big task to operate the entire system of law.
Combating crime, guarantees the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to justice, and the security of law enforcement, without the need to implement the care of "child support".
In addition, child trafficking prevention, from family to society, can do better.
For example, a common case, three people rest at the train station, and their parents sleep, wake up and find out the baby's gone.
A child of two years cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, at least have a considerable sense of protection.
Both parents rest in turn or put their children under sound protection, are the minimum means of preventing child abduction.
From the other side of the police to combat trafficking, the purchase of a child abducted should also be cared and punished.
Single wrongful acts are often just a link in a long chain.
According to our Penal Code, the legal sentence for trafficking in children is five years; the circumstances are particularly serious, available for the death penalty and the confiscation of property.
The crime of child trafficking is clearly a more serious penalty under the general trend of "light punishment".
But there are still a lot of trafficking cases every year.
As you can see, some people are lagging behind in raising children and are less legally conscious.
The legal education of this part should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control trafficking, it cannot be strictly enforced by official law.
If the market is widespread, the traitors are interested, the means of trafficking are constantly being innovative, creating a "war" situation with law enforcement, and trafficking will be inefficient mud.
Therefore, breaking the concept of backwardness, universal legal common sense, also helps to combat trafficking and buy child crime.
Yang Ho-dong is speaking the spirit of the 19th and provincial party's 19th and provincial party.
To draw strength from the party's 100 years of struggle.
On December 10th, the Hunan Daily News (all media journalist Kimberway) was organized by the Provincial Council, and on the morning of 10 December, the Provincial Council's Standing Committee, the Minister of Advocacy, Yang Hodong, the Minister of Advocacy of the Provincial Council, gave an interactive presentation at the Mallian Video Founding Park, to learn to learn to follow up on the spirit of the General Secretary-General Xi's important instructions to Hunan and learn to follow the spirit of the 12th provincial party.

In the interactive exchange, representatives of grass-roots cadres, business representatives, youth representatives, how to understand the decisive meaning of "two established" and how cultural enterprises manage direction, how the new age youth draw strength from the history of the centennial party, etc., the answer to Yang Hodong, in a common language, a vivid example of the fact that he was a member of the Al-Shabaab, to draw the power of progress from the 100-year history of the party, to be united around the party, to follow the party, to write responsibility and responsibility with youth.
The Beijing regional college graduates are expected to reach 268,000 people in 2022 - Xinhua Network
Xinhua Beijing, 11 December, journalists from the Beijing City Council of Education and Social Security, the Beijing City Human Resources and Social Security Board, were informed that the Beijing Regional Graduates of Higher Education in 2022 were expected to reach 268,000, an increase of 16 million over last year.

Journalists learned that the Beijing City Human Resources and Social Security Authority will build a platform for practice, increase the supply of jobs, actively contact 40 higher education graduates' workplace experience base, visit the user units, integrate demand information and job information; focus on "six groups " , namely, expanding the recruitment of state-owned enterprises, expanding the recruitment of State-owned enterprises, expanding the recruitment of grass-roots projects, expanding the recruitment of grass-roots projects, expanding employment, expanding employment, expanding the number of job-led jobs; and implementing "one-long plan" dynamic management, recommending not less than five jobs for each graduate, ensuring that 100 per cent of family graduates who are willing to work to achieve assistance, etc.
Actually, I don't know if it's a shop or a rider's fault.
There's no document on the bag.
I can't trace it.
I hope you understand.
Because the delivery time is 30 minutes faster than it shows.
No, thank you.
Yes, I've changed a rider.
He's been waiting a long time.
The restaurant always said it was under way.
I waited hours.
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories of Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil, five levels.
The first olive oil or natural olive oil is the oil that comes directly from fresh olive fruit, which is used to remove the oil from the alien.
Depending on the acid level, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin: The highest-quality olive oil is pure natural.
It's delicious, it's got a light and nice plant, with no more than 1% acid.
Fine Virgin: A little acid, but not more than 2%, taste pure, aromatic.
Normal primary olive oil: Taste and taste are still good, not more than 3.3% acid.

The democratic summit is over. Biden says the fire of freedom never goes out.
The online Summit for Democracy (10 December) attended by Governments from 110 countries around the world and civil society and private sector leaders.
In his closing statement, Biden said that the fire of freedom burned in the hearts of everyone in the world, and the dictatorship would never be extinguished.
He also said that the second global "Democracy Summit" was planned next year.
The representative of the Taiwan government, the government member Tang Feng and Hong Kong democratic human rights activist in exile in England, also addressed the next day's summit.
Biden said, " We know how hard it is to work before us.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because I said before, as this summit shows, the democratic world is everywhere.
The dictatorship can never put out the microfire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people around the world and around the world ... "
Biden also stated that the defence of democracy requires a common effort of society as a whole.
He said: " As leaders of the Government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen democratic fences, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, more resistance to the buffers and shocks of dictatorship, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest ... "
The theme of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" was the defence of human rights, the consolidation of democracy and the confrontation of power, and countering digital authority and positive democratic values.
This day happens to International Human Rights Day.
In his opening address on the same day, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Gutierrez also stated that the cause of democracy faces challenges globally, particularly emerging digital technologies.
He said, " It is time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience ...
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, updating social compacts, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, indigenousism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution ... "
Hong Kong democratic human rights activists, speaking to the Summit through pre-recorded videos, remind participants of the human rights situation of Chinese minorities such as Hong Kong and Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said: " The world has long accepted the rise of China, but has not established a mechanism to hold them accountable ...
That's why politicians and civil society leaders have to work together.
We must use everything we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority ... "
The government has also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Communist Party.
He said, " Perhaps some of you are afraid of pissing Secretary Xi, and perhaps some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and some of you have not realized the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. "
In his round table discussion against digital dictatorship, Tang Feng, a member of the Taiwan Executive Council, published a "State statement" through video, emphasizing Taiwan's standing at the forefront of confrontation against dictatorship and authority.
He also shared the experience of how to fight the new coronary epidemic through transparency of information and mutual trust.
He said: " As Taiwan’s democracy flourishes, we have been firmly at the forefront of global confrontation against authority, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights ...
During the epidemic, powerful governments everywhere were rationalizing human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
But in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without a seal, and we can beat false information without going down. "
While taking place on the following schedule of the Democratic Summit, the United States Treasury announced that 15 individuals, 10 entities, such as China, North Korea and others identified as serious violations of human rights, imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company identified as using surveillance techniques to assist human rights violations.
I've taken pictures and uploaded them to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why the delivery is delayed.
I thought it was.
Then I'm not screaming anymore.
No, I'm not.
I'll file a complaint.
You can't. Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Waiting for you so long.
No, I didn't get it. Call.
Please inform him to send it to our company.
I don't want to wait any more minutes.
A meal waited an hour and a half.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I want to cancel the order.
Why don't you cancel it?
Hello. The saliva chicken from the restaurant is raw.
I wanted to try tennis, but I was afraid I couldn't hold on, so I wanted to find a similar price practice.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices are often comparable to the level of friendship, and if you can't tell, then the normal situation is cheaper than a shot, and this kind of "introspect" is actually industrial trash.
They're low-intensity, they hit the beat, they're very vibrating, hardballs can't hold, they're hard to handle.
The logic and subtext of their existence are -- tennis is so hard to learn, you know you can't afford to buy expensive things, you play cheap things, you play twice, and you won't fight again, so you don't hurt.
When you really know what's good and bad, it means you're getting better, and I'll come back here and buy expensive.
It's recommended to spend a similar price, buy a better second-hand bat, choose the penence, or Dunlop, and these two brands are not famous enough, so the good bats can't sell the price, and the new 500,600 is good.
It's nice to rookies, but it's chicken ribs when they're new, but most people, especially girls, can't get past the new ones.
Orders have been delayed in delivery several times
Can I help you follow up?
Postponement
Thank you.
So, I already have a credit?
Do I need to re-order the next one?
Hello, I ordered food in this restaurant, but there's a lot of food missing, and saliva chickens are born.
I'm not gonna take it for any reason. Please cancel.
I'm asking for delivery. I'm not taking it at all.

Girls raise money for her sister as an arrow: " It's good to think of skin wounds " - Xinhua Network
A girl standing in front of a big board in front of a big board, with the words "human target, ten bucks a arrow."
Yesterday morning, a picture of "Hangzhou Girl" raised for my sister's circle.
Photos show that a girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stands in front of a large board slightly higher than a man, and it says "human target, ten dollars a arrow" and means that the roadman can shoot with bows and arrows after paying.
The act triggered a debate on the Internet.
Last night, the head of propaganda at the Lower City Bureau of the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau confirmed to the New Kyoto newspaper that the police confirmed that the girl had made such an excessive move for her sister, but that this act was not worth promoting, and after warning, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
The girl's street arrow target raised the defendant's commandment.
In the web-borne picture, a long-haired girl stood in front of a large wooden board, and it was written in black ink with the words "human target, ten bucks an arrow" and she wrote on the other board with her bank account and micro-mail, paying the treasure account, etc.
The picture was controversial when it came online.
Some netizens think that this is "the begging of the eyeball" and that there are a lot of people who feel sorry for it.
"We found out on patrols around 10 a.m. on 23rd, when the crowd was already surrounded. "
In an interview with the local media, the police police station near the incident, said that two girls in the stand were around 20 years old and dressed well.
Among them, the girl who was a human target has been crying, asking for the roadman to play this game; the other girl is helping her drink on the side, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia, and now needs surgery fees.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou to learn that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukaemia treatment. "
Last night, the head of propaganda at the lower city of the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau told the journalist of the New Kyoto newspaper that the girl was named Gigari, raising her sister Ji Ga-Ying.
But it still takes over 300,000 dollars for treatment, and it's not possible to raise a good way to do this.
He said that throughout the process, two girls were targeted, one in charge, but not involved, and no arrows were found throughout the process, but someone looked around and sent them to Twitter.
The police were identified by the security department, and the arrows used were not controlled.
The head said that " no such way of raising eyeballs " .
After warning from the police station, she left the police station.
Heat-dispersion: good lightness: convenience, appearance material: Satisfied macros always have a high value for money.

What's the hottest thing in 2021?
It's definitely the Tokyo Olympics.
You think only Olympic Ken can win the prize?
There was a "Look! Project manager can hit the gold Olympic project" was hot, and it mentioned that project managers could definitely be first in many projects, and no one can do it: moving bricks, business trips, stay up late is the day-to-day project manager's day, fire rescue, back pot, apologies.
An article that seems to be joking also tells the daily pain of the project managers, which represents the power of the current project management.
And the people who work in project management are gradually choosing to get themselves out of their work through some actions.
From the annual increase in the number of PMPs (internationally certified project management professionals), more and more project management practitioners have improved their project management capacity by learning.
According to China ' s Twenty-Year Development Report on Project Management (1999-2019): By September 2019, the cumulative number of PMPs had been reported nearly 600,000 times, with about 420,000 people certified through PMP, with about 300,000 valid certificates, or 31.2 per cent of the global total PMP certificates.
The number of PMP certificates has increased year by year over the last 10 years, which means that more and more project managers realize that doing things simply by moving old experience, and a rapidly changing working environment that gives us a way to learn, stand on the shoulder of a scientific giant to explore the way forward.
However, can PMP be able to ensure that project management is free?
Many project management beginners have indicated that by learning relevant courses such as PMP/IPMP, the 10 major areas of project management and the five major process groups were systematically available, but that a fog was still a fog when project management was actually done.
Many project managers often give feedback on the following issues: project management is not well recognized, based on personal experience, empty project management theory, unknown practice; Lack of system project management process system support, impossible to land, project estimates, poor control sensitivity and drag; members are unclear, and "old oil bars" in the team are not clear, and the "old oil bars" in the team are not aware of how to respond to communication between sectors, and the project is difficult to advance.
As a result, focusing on product innovation and R & D management has helped a large number of good businesses to develop a large number of key research and development talent such as product managers, project managers, and have received the Chinese Tianhua Summer Consulting with the online course of the Research and Development Project Manager's Special Training Camp, which has been named "China Enterprise Research and Development Management Training Base".
The R & D Project Manager Special Training Camp online course is a way of learning online fragmentation, combining combat cases, tools and methods of many R & D enterprises to help you master the knowledge and standard actions required by project managers to move on their own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and less inputs to promote the development process of project managers and to provide enterprises with efficient operational results.
If you can't say it, you can see how other participants evaluate this course: this course is not only a professional lecture on the content of the course, combined with the international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenes of many well-known enterprises.
And it provides scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms to help participants apply the content of learning to specific work after school.
There's only one order for a shrimp dumpling?
Why are there six of them?
On the eve of the "Twenty-two" campaign to consumers for rational consumption, the Economic Watch Network, the professional financial news site.

As a licensed consumer financial institution, Jing-shin has been working to help people build their happy lives with quality and caring services, advocate consumers to build a good and correct consumption perspective and respond positively to regulatory calls to raise rational consumption awareness among consumers, especially young groups.
Over the past few years, Jing-shin has been conducting a full range of and diverse financial knowledge-raising activities for youth groups, including university students, and rational guidance to the consumption needs of young groups, including in cooperation with top institutions in the country, helping them to build rational consumption concepts and rationally plan consumption needs and thus to build up their wealth.
On the occasion of the twenty-two, the quick letter reminds all consumer friends of the right sense of consumption and the right money, resist blind consumption and overconsumption, avoiding consumption borrowing errors, so that they avoid affecting individual letters and future economic life.
Consumption must be planned in advance, and pay back on time.
If overdue, overdue records will be recorded in personal credit reports, which may have a negative impact on future economic life such as buying cars, buying houses.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, formal institutions and channels should be chosen and to check whether the relevant institutions have operational qualifications.

Viet Nam People ' s Network - Gulf Cooperation Council addresses common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman ' s stop includes Oman, the United Arab Emirates (United Arab Emirates), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the first visit of Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on Qatar, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations, while closely related to Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the sea union and have had a negative impact on the economy of the region.
Four Arab countries blocked land and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, and the Gulf countries signed an agreement between the Gulf States and Kuwait to "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia reopened its borders with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are appointing new ambassadors in Qatar through both countries to take the lead in their efforts to restore relations with Qatar.
The Arab Gulf countries resolve differences to restore relations with Qatar from the need to unite for the interests and regional stability of States, with the aim of addressing common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the parties agreed to open the first direct land route between two Gulf neighbours.
The 725 km-long route between the two countries will facilitate the travel and integration of the supply chain of citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two companies will sign 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion in cooperation.
The Saudi Crown Prince ' s visit to the Gulf countries happened to Iran and the world's largest countries on the rescue of the Iranian nuclear agreement called JCPOA, a agreement condemned by a Gulf Arab State for considering it unable to resolve the issue of missiles with Iran.
The Gulf countries have always seen Iran as a long-term "combatant" and the Iranian nuclear program as a threat to regional security.
The Gulf States believe that it is flawed not to address the Iranian missile problem and that it is not taking action to contain Iran ' s activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia and Iran have made direct negotiations with Iran in the context of failure to meet the wishes of the Gulf States.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors in reducing economic growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The forthcoming CAC summit will be the first summit of the States of the Sea Union since the end of the dispute between some member States and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate diplomatic results to contribute to the restoration of the unity of the CCC, while proposing measures to fully cooperate their member States in addressing common challenges and contribute to stability and development in the Gulf countries.
From 7:00 to 9:30, the deposit must be returned and cancelled.
Okay.
It's called the New Mountain's super-run exhaust!
This car our team brought you is a dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship overrun, Murcielago's replacement model - Aventador LP 700-4!
It's worth nearly $2 million, a year's road tax, ten thousand, four-wheel drive. Why LP 700?
Because of 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
That's not clear, but the data says it takes 2.9 seconds to speed up 0-100 km/h, probably when the editor's Myvi is 30 km/h, and it's 100 km/h, um.
Low cars, arrogant scissors doors, huge vents around the body and a view of the extra 6.5 v12 engine under the glass, perfect interpretation of Lamborghini's style.
There's no need to say much about the car. Just go Google for a second.

Resonance of the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times - Xinhua Network
The so-called university spirit is a series of ideas and values that a university has long developed in its development, and is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, university spirit is essential to political, economic, cultural, technological, social development, and even progress of a nation.
From the birth of the first modern university in the world, universities have a unique mission that is different from other social organizations, and for our universities, the spirit that has emerged in the autumn of national distress, is more influenced by traditional cultures and times, advocating the values of "Mingdzi, Shujiping" and patriotism.
Currently, there is a growing trend in information and internationalization in higher education, competition for education worldwide, competition for science and technology, growing competition for talent, and higher education as an important " supply side " , whose structural reforms are facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the introduction of the "General Programme for the Integration of World-class Universities and First-class Studies" has been demonstrated by the confidence and determination of our country from the great powers of higher education to higher education, and the need for higher updates to university development.
How can we work to join the world in a short time and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a group of world-class disciplines to achieve a bend overcar?
In addition to the firm goal of self-confidence, path confidence and confidence, higher education should give full three advantages: first, to bring together to build up brands and image by constantly introducing outstanding overseas academic talent, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and the quality of learning from world-class universities; second, cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization in 5,000 years, promoting the development of a good traditional culture, thereby building strength, shaping branding and enhancing image; and third, institutional advantages, enhancing the goal of socialist countries, building consensus, optimizing resource allocation, providing sustainable and solid safeguards for schools to accelerate the advanced levels of the world.
It is particularly important to realize that building a world-class university is not possible, and schools must show their personality and character while taking advantage.
The special features of the school are both common Chinese and the unique targeting of their own goals, traditions and resource grants.
In the case of Zhejiang University, we have focused on three main features in our studies: one is to highlight the development of innovative entrepreneurial talent development, building scientific integration, integration of schools, integrating the human environment, creating a chain-wide entrepreneurship education ecosystem; and second, to highlight cross-cutting disciplines, promote the optimization of the discipline system, create a cross-cutting institutional environment, actively nurture cross-cutting cross-cutting results; and third to highlight the characteristics of school systems and social services, and to accelerate the development of a system of cooperation in the Pan-Zhejiang production research and cooperation.
In this process, it is particularly important to keep the university spirit alive and to bring the spirit of the university to the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the "Innovation" school, "True, Shud, Declared, Declared" common values and the Heiner River, Kaijinde, the former people, the tree of the nation, the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang.
It's an important guarantee that schools insist on the right direction, building up cultural heights, gathering spiritual power, rich and far-reaching.
Among them, the Heiner River emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusion, reflecting the heart of "the world's talent for me" as a quality concept of learning from world-renowned schools; "The Enlightenment" emphasizes the spirit of truth, which refers to the teaching of the university, while pursuing truth, is more of a deeded pottery and personality; "Pre-members" reflects the spirit of reform innovation, which contains both knowledge of new, scientific innovation and innovation in reform and development; and "The tree country" emphasizes the dedication of patriotism, and that universities should always be humiliated with the fate of the nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and values is the soul of 120 years of school at Zhejiang University.
"The wise listen to the silent, the bright see the invisible " .
Chinese higher education institutions, when they are further based on the Chinese-specific socialist cause, take a deep sense of the position and historical mission of higher education, accelerate the construction of the world's leading university.
At the same time, the freedom of human care and independence, the spirit of the university and the spirit of the nation, thus providing endless motivation for the realization of the rich and national revitalization of the nation and to achieve the common ideal of humanity.

When the NFT fire came out, the encrypted community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a block chain game called "Axie Information" had a huge impact in South-East Asia, where some residents who lost jobs due to the epidemic began to gain stable income in this game.
"Axie Information" is a game of pets based on block chain technology, bringing together a variety of games, including NFT, the highest number of NFT projects currently traded, and has now exceeded $3 billion.
TokenTerminal data show that Axie Infoinity earns more than $8.2 million a day, and to force the King's glory.

Seeing a news about the price of friends' stock, my biggest feeling is the choice of business on the track, which means the choice of the industry that invests in the target, first to choose a large-sized industry with a large growth space, at least 100 billion market size; and second, to choose the industry that will grow well in the future three to five years, to consider industries that have the best growth in the next three to five years; and finally, to choose the industry with policy support.
How wide the track is the size of the market, how long the track is the stage of industry development, whether the track is flat or rough is the competitive pattern of the industry.
Go for the right track!
The first thing in the new year is to summarize 2021 to adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactics are "do the things right," which means doing the right thing.
And the strategy is "do the right thing," which means doing the right thing.
The strategy is to find direction, the tactics are to land, and there's room for strategic thinking over most tactical thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking) can be thought about how to increase the retention rate of core and high-value customers; for example, on increasing the retention rate of customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on increasing activity participation (tactical thinking), the right activity KPI can be considered to achieve the right activity objectives, such as increasing target customer participation, activate high value silencers, precision and pull new; on increasing DAU, can consider whether current growth is healthy and sustainable.
In 12 years of birth, bitcoin had several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small Central American country, designated bitcoin as a legal currency for the first time that Bitcoin became a country or region.
On October 12, the SEC approved ProShares for the first time in eight years for the launch of Bitcoin ETF and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the re-expanding of the first compliance bitcoin future ETF to the United States capital market, with the re-expanding of encrypted money investment.
Bitcoin is not the lead from the point of view of block chain technology.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin made a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which increased the anonymity of bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in the transaction by changing the data structure of the block itself.

American Asian groups complained about discrimination in admissions to three Ivy schools, including Yale - Xinhua Network
Xinhua, Washington, D.C., May 23rd, filed a complaint with over 30 Asian groups in the United States Department of Education and Justice against three Ivy famous schools — Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College discrimination against Asian students during admission.
The Asian Education Union, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington that day.
At the launch, Zhao Woo-kun, the group's president, said that the number of Asian applicants who met admission to American schools over the past 0 years had doubled, but that the share of Asians had remained almost at the same level in these three American schools.
Many studies have shown that these colleges have "long-term sustainability and systematic discrimination against Asian students in the so-called "complex considerations".
Zhao Woo-kun described that 20'4 years of research by scholars like Sanders showed that in these three higher education institutions, Asians had the lowest enrolment rate in all ethnic groups.
Data from the United States Department of Education also show that in all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest enrolment ratio of Asian students, with a de facto racial quota for Asian applications for over 20 years.
Zhao Woo-kun told Xinhua journalists that after they expected to file a complaint, the United States Department of Education, the Department of Justice, was able to investigate and take measures to prevent these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions.
They also expect that the university will take the initiative to focus on this issue and change the admission policy for Asians.
At present, three registered higher education institutions have not responded.
The Asian Education Union was founded in 20'5 years, when it complained about discrimination in admissions at Harvard University, but the United States Department of Education was not accepted on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American group, this complaint included American Indian, Korean, Japanese, Pakistani educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a house broker that was located in Zhejiang Yu Yao-Ting Town, where Mr. Luk decided to buy it after he was watching the house on several occasions.
In December of the same year, Mr. Luk consulted with the family of the owner of the house, Lin, on the day after consultations on the details of the purchase of the plant, made a deposit of $200,000 through bank transfers.
Lin signed as a payee on the "Profit and Sale of the Plant" article, which states, "If the buyer does not want to buy the plant, the deposit is returned to the seller, and if the seller is reluctant to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned to the seller and the parties have agreed to enter into a contract for the sale of the plant within a week. "
However, the parties failed to agree on the main contractual terms such as the scope of the sale of the plant, the payment modalities, resulting in late failure to enter into a contract for the sale of houses.
Given the failure of the parties to reach consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later Lin returned $200,000 to Mr. Lu.
It's hard to see the house, the deposit is paid, the house is ready, the contract is off the door, and the seller won't sell it, which makes Mr. Luk helpless and angry.
To that end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to Yu Yao City People's Court.
After hearing, the Court found that the parties were finally unable to enter into a formal contract and could not be attributed to the accused alone, and that the case should not be subject to a down payment penalty and that the defendant was not liable for a double return of the deposit ...
After the trial, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance maintained its sentence.
[Lawyer reminds] Be careful in the course of the transaction.
In signing the contract, as buyer, the necessary careful attention obligations, such as verification of information on the owner of the house, whether the house was occupied, and to clarify the specific time, place of delivery in order to prevent disputes between the parties in the performance of the contract.
After Friday, after the Democratic Summit, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China made a statement on Saturday (11 December) that the United States organized the Leadership Democracy Summit, which was "in ideologically tectonicized, weaponized, false democracy, anti-democratic reality, inciting division confrontation and transfer of domestic contradictions " .
The Chinese Government believes that " for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and value concepts on people, pursuing " democratic transformations " , and has had catastrophic consequences.
"Democracy" has long become a weapon of mass destruction that interferes with other countries by the United States.
The summit was a move by Biden to keep his campaign promise.
Two days of meetings were held on video, with 111 global leaders invited, including Taiwan leaders, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States with problems with its own democracy, claiming that the United States was not eligible to host such a summit.
There are also questions internationally and in the United States, such as criticism of invited leaders, such as leaders of powerful dictatorships, such as the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, some doubt that the Byden government's true intention was not to organize this summit for geopolitical purposes for democracy.
The new German Prime Minister Scholtz also participated in the Video Democracy Summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday stated that " today's American democracy is a remarkable disease, money politics, identity politics, political confrontation, political confrontation, social tear, racial contradictions, poverty and poverty are growing " , and democracy in the United States is a capital-based " rich game " .
In his statement, President Biden stated that " as the leader of the Government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen democratic fences, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, more resistant to the buffer and impact of dictatorship, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest ... "
He stressed that democracy was not for granted, " We must keep updating it among every generation, and in my opinion, this is a decisive challenge of our time ... "
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "in the face of continuing and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend " .
The United States has committed itself to a one-year operation that will be launched following this democratic summit, including an initiative of $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democracy before the physical democracy summit planned for the end of 2022.
Biden said, " Let all our countries implement our commitments and report on our progress next year " .

Education thinking: how college exams make the "student" "scum" each other - Xinhua Network
Three students from Lanzhou University of Transport wrote to the school leader reflecting confusion about the university exam and proposed to improve the difficulty of the examination, to change the subject of the examination, to make the examination truly reflect the actual level of the student's claim.
Indeed, college exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
On university campus, students come from the four seas of Lake Five, with different levels of competence, and the degree of learning varies, and learning is different.
There are different feelings for groups with such diversity.
Of course, if the test is single, the repetition rate is high, the subject is too simple, it will certainly create another very different feeling.
Students who are not good, they may pass before the test, and if you do something else, you can do it twice as much as you can.
So, "scum" can pass without input, even high points; "Student" never falls out of class, homework, notes, and the exams are not much "unusual status."
So, Lanzhou students reflect the problems in the university exam, and believe that this situation is not just a big deal.
In that sense, it's a compliment to the three students who wrote straight.
In fact, it's not surprising that people who went to college knew that they were ready to take the test from teachers to "sets" and to get "focus counselling" before they get a test, even with a little copy of the exam, and it's not surprising to ask teachers to raise their hands.
In the view of the author, as a quality assessment of teaching, measuring the eligibility of a university exam, is more about the full knowledge of teaching and learning by teachers and scientific propositions on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate level, the profession starts to be broken down, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that the basic point of knowledge of a subject is the content of the university exam.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the subject, and the space for change is not large in terms of knowledge, and it is largely fixed.
As teachers say, " Basic knowledge of university mathematics 20 years ago, is still studying, or is it the focus ... "
But the knowledge point is largely unchanged, does not represent a single test type, and the test is repeated.
In many universities, examinations usually form a group of topics, then a combination of senior teachers in the subject, and the examination papers are also involved by all teachers who bear the section, so that it can overcome the repetition of the test to some extent.
However, a set of topics that are consistent with teaching and learning, the subject is difficult to be distributed according to the overall student learning situation, and a comprehensive analysis of the level of student learning, thus making the examination proposition difficult and dynamic, which highlights both basic knowledge and capacity-sensitive, while innovative design of the subject.
The exam is the baton of university education, and the students will have the corresponding preparation programme, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
The student proposal letter, Lanzhou has given great importance to the school and has deployed a whole school-wide programme.
The teaching units are required to organize teachers to conduct a comparison of seminars and courses, to develop the subject of examination papers and related systems, while strengthening monitoring and inspection of examination papers and audit sessions, fine-tuning results, and strengthening the overall appraisal of the various courses.
The problem of addressing the single type of test subject from the mechanism, the issue of the issue that university examinations need to face, of course, the corresponding system is needed, but kung fu is expensive and requires a full knowledge of teaching, not only through the teaching content, but more than learning, but more than learning, and learning will be better compatible, and the examination will be more realistic, so that the "student" and "scum" are more realistic, so that the "student" and "scum" are more realistic.

Sabah 3,200 newborn babies have no paper, cut off in special anti-false paper.
The Sabah National Registry said that due to the light of the special anti-false paper inventory, it was unable to issue paper to the primary baby since early October, and that 3,200 people had accumulated so far.
However, the director of the Bureau, Karu Aminus, promised that all babies who had applied for paper had been recorded in the system, and that the anti-false paper would be re-issued when it arrived next week.
He explained at a press conference about a 10-month report on the printing of paper from the Sabah newspaper.
He said that the problem had emerged two months ago, and the sand was facing the same problem.
"One reason is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-false paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in my country ... "
He explained that the anti-false paper used in Sabah's paper was different from other regions, so it was not possible to borrow the inventory of other states.
Kello Aminus revealed that the latest collection of anti-false paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on 8th for partial printing.
" The Bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods and return to Sabah for the final printing immediately, with an estimated two more working days (20 December) to be handed over to the applicant ... "
"We'll inform applicants to go to the local branch to get paper. "
He added that Sabah has issued 24801 newspaper paper this year.
From 7:00 to now.
Is that almost there?
I mean food.
I'm waiting across the street from the PRS_ORG.
Okay, thanks. Because the restaurant says it's ready.

48 hours of nucleic acid negative, with a "buff zone" by the State Council for the United Nations Control Mechanism, which called for the strengthening of the urban epidemic control at the port - Xinhua Network
Xinhua, Beijing, 11 December, issued a circular on strengthening the control of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic in the city of the port (except for Hong Kong, Macao, where there is no exception to the port of Hong Kong, Macao, where there is a port of Hong Kong, Macao) to hold 48 hours of negative evidence of kernel acid testing and to conduct at least one nuclear acid test after the arrival of city personnel at the land border port.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is to determine the scope of the port from the provinces and municipalities and to the date of the announcement, until 15 March 2022.
In addition, the notice suggests that conditional port cities can study the establishment of epidemic control buffer zones within the jurisdiction.
The head of the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Agency described cross-border trade as the main economic pillar of the local economy and frequent traffic between the two sides.
The implementation of a divisional differential management policy, which has been transformed from a control spill line to two lines, is expected to achieve a front shift, compressing the risk of spilling from the epidemic, with a minimum social impact, with minimum social costs to achieve the greatest effectiveness of disease control.
In recent times, there have been many local gathering epidemics in the country, which were entered by the city of the port.
The above-mentioned notification indicates that this exposes the lack of timely warning of local epidemic surveillance, and that the closed ring management of high-risk posts is not implemented, regular nucleic acid detection flows are in form, cold chain items are not in place, central isolation sites are not regulated, and that the outbreak emergency disposal is not sufficiently scientificly accurate.
Notification requires that nine areas, such as the improvement of the urban epidemic control mechanism at the port, the sound of the early warning system for epidemic monitoring and early warning systems, the implementation of border control measures, to accelerate the filling of the city's short-board weaknesses at the port, without relaxing, scientific precision and precision in the control of the prevention and control of the protection of the protection line.
The circular emphasizes that cities at ports need to synchronize research on epidemic control with civil security efforts, deploy, publish and access to the civil security hotline, regular screening of the risks of basic living supplies, prices, etc., and to address and respond in a timely manner to the prominent issues reflected by the public.
According to the notification, the port cities referred to include open land, waterways, air ports in the counties (municipal, district, flag), the municipalities (areas, states, coalitions) and the municipalities directly under which the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) are identified and announced in a timely manner in accordance with epidemic control needs.

The oil pipeline video has been on the ground for 20 years of bloodthirsty killing the truth.
(Video source: pipeline)
On December 11, a microdocument from the pipeline platform called "The Killing Machine" attracted widespread attention.
The film describes the American war in Afghanistan, which has forced the export of American democracy through war, 20 years of poor soldiers, bloodthirsty, killing innocent people and committed crimes against humanity.
Misuse of drone air strikes hospitals, schools and other civilian sites, distorting humanity and establishing killing groups.
For 20 years, the United States forces have killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. Army has tortured and humiliated the suspect.
A crime against humanity has provoked more Afghan hatred.
As the video says, the more afraid of the American war on terror.
The war did not bring peace democracy, hope for prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a country full of scoundrels and countless killings.
Poke video, let's expose the false face of American democracy in the name of "terrorism" and bloodthirsty killing!
I accidentally saw the following article, from a commercial perspective and the preservation period, why is the logistics company in the tax zone helping to make cans, although the cans are deep processed and not within the scope of the tax logistics company, and here may explain why the client wants to do so?
I went to a lot of milk powder factory, and I went to contact a lot of milk powder production lines.
The bag is exactly the same as the milk powder they're listening to.
Then you will certainly ask: "Why is the bag-packing period of one year and the duration of the hearing is two years or longer?"
Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening to the loading and the bag so much?
It's actually a lot of consumers, or Mom's class thinks it's better in quality because raw materials are different.
It's just that the raw materials are just good.
And there are consumers who react out of this mentality and say that the taste or taste of listening is different!
Now let me tell you why it's expensive.
Why are their raw materials so different?
Because most of the manufacturers when pricing, considering that if the bag price is too high, consumers are difficult to accept, which means that the manufacturer produces low profits, or without profit, what does the manufacturer survive?
So they have a huge increase in the price of the hearing to protect their profit space.
So most manufacturers push the suit, not the bag.
And what's the cost of advertising for so many manufacturers every year?
You know what you want.
So as society develops, market promotion costs, such as salesmen, mall display costs, product gifts, advertising costs, etc.
So the manufacturers are increasing new products, and they're listening, and their prices are rising, and it's actually new as market costs increase.
The main purpose is to make higher profits, but their raw materials will not cost up to $3,4.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, to connect to hospital doctors, to assist in the promotion of the product, from $30 to $80 in the first hearing.
China's laws are absolutely not allowed to operate this way, but it's a pit to consumers.
It is suggested that you buy a bag of milk powder in a can at home, which saves costs while increasing the preservation and sealing of milk powder without having any effect on children.
And don't think that the shelf is longer than the bag, but if it's the same as the package after opening, it's just that it's not easy to save after the bag is opened, it's easy to get the tide.
The food is cold, it's dry and hard, and it's completely out of order.

I'll call the police if you don't refund.
Many times, this is the worst experience today.
It's totally unacceptable.
Okay, okay.
But remind the restaurant and the rider.
Avoid next time.
I want to know exactly when the meal is delivered.
That time was delayed.
I don't know when.
If you cancel the order, can you return the money?
How do you want to pay the rider for the service?

When you go to the book market, you can feel the fire of successful books.
Many of the successful books today are the best principles -- that is, assuming or implying you can do it, and tell you what you need to do."
It's like saying that it's the most important, fundamental part of how to do it.
And that's why these books have a common feature -- either the best, or nothing; it's 100 or zero; either you go to Tarzan or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle" makes everyone look at it and admit "right," but 99% of them are scared in front of the start line.
Because this theory is about the path of "you have to be determined, to be a 180-degree shift," which is exactly the deadly weakness of many.
For those who follow old and refuse to change, you're going to shout, "You're going to change" in his ear, no doubt you're lying to yourself, playing the bull.
Most people will be afraid in front of the word "change," and they're hard to decide; or they're going to be able to make a difference with a moment of impulse and bravely take the first step, but often not long, and they can't hold on to a long time.
The famous voice of Mr. Ma's famous "from tomorrow" is the most divine expression of this classic of "general humanity".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often beyond the limits of the ability of ordinary people to make the vast majority of people "sniff."
Perhaps the "sub-principle principle" is a way to get more ordinary people on a relatively successful path.
The core of the "sub-prime principle" is "lowing the threshold" -- it encourages a theory of "a small win-win" that if 100 can't be done, only one can do it: because one is always greater than zero; if you can't get to Tarzan, it's just a little sand dunes at your door, because it's always better than it was.
Anyway, as long as you do something, it's better than not.
Because of the significant decline in the threshold, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to hold on, and if you insist, the probability of success increases.
It's just a little longer to follow the path of success of the Second Principles.
In short, the "best principle" is a few, although on the surface, it can eventually inspire, actually a few; and the "sub-principle principle" can effectively inspire more people and benefit as much as possible.
So, do I need to reorder now?
The phone's not answered.
It's been delayed.
Not yet.
Excuse me, when will it be delivered?
How can we get in touch?
Please cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer. Thank you.
He's two meals short, but one order is over.
I'd like to ask you how to contact the rider.

Qinghai Lake Naked Wall Resources increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua Network
On December 11, Xining, Xinhua News (Reporter, Zhang Hongxiang) was informed from the Agricultural Rural Department of Qinghai Province, the latest monitoring results show that the storage of the Qinghai Lake nudity wall resources increased by 0.71 million tons this year to 10.85 million tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared to the beginning of the protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake Naked Carp, known as "Squidfish", is a valuable species of fish in Qinghai Lake, which is important for maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai lake basin.
In the 1960s, the number of naked walls fell sharply, with a sharp decline in the number of nudity walls in the Qinghai lake, with 2592 tons of naked walls in 2002 in the Qinghai Lake.
In 2004, the Chinese Red List of Chinese Species was listed as a endangered species in the Qinghai Lake.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake-making fish, prohibiting the sale of naked walls by any unit, collective and individual to the main rivers and tributaries of the Qinghai Lake and Lake Area, and the sale of naked walls and their products.
At the same time, measures such as the design of a reasonable "fish tunnel" through artificial proliferation and cleaning up Qinghai Lake mainly into the lake river lanes, and the storage of the Qinghai Lake Naked Carp resources has increased year by year.
The Deputy Director of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, Yang Lin, introduced that, to date, the Qinghai Lake Naked Wall has accumulated nearly 180 million tails, contributing to the recovery of naked walls in Qinghai Lake by more than 23%.
The Qinghai Sanjiang region is an important ecological barrier and water-based area in the country and Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification east in the west.
To protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiang and the Qinghai Lake waters, to protect aquatic wildlife and maintain the biodiversity of the Qingxi Plateau, since this year, the Qinghai has issued a ban on fishing circulars for the Yangtze, Yellow River, Qinghai Lake, and the construction of a comprehensive ban on the "A River One River One Lake".

The restaurant only brought me one bag. It's in the bag. It's cold.
Would you like to ask, is the takeout in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
Want to know if it's missing or did someone take it, thanks?
It's been an hour. It's not even here yet.
It's too long to see a fake article.
Give the male science you don't know.
Most girls suddenly experience their first official leave one day during the age of 13-15, closed down at around 50.
Then you'll be more regular every month if you're healthy.
But it's not a regular prediction, it's about a week or so, it's necessary to prepare early, and sometimes luck is going to turn over.
The length of time, the amount of blood, the pain varies from person to person, some for three days, some for a week; some people are bleeding less, some people don't react, some people are moving away from ambulances, and pains change over time, and they don't mean they don't hurt forever.
Menstruation is beyond control, and within 24 hours of bleeding until the end of the day, only blood can be used to prevent the flow of clothes chairs with sanitary towels or tampons.
The pain is mainly due to prostate, and it's not working to eat Broven when it's just beginning to get to the pain.
Before the biological period, it's too much blood and prostate release, and it's easy to have a stomach.
If it's about the cycle, it'll be a period in two days.
The sanitary towels are best replaced in two or three hours, or it's easy to breed bacteria, remove sleep time, and the worst is to replace six times a day, 7 days a month, that's 42 pieces, and if you add 50 pre-preparated copies, it's not one per month.
"Here, the tampons don't have to be changed, about five or six hours, up to eight hours."
Menstruation may be more grumpy, and the egging period is unstable because of the emotional instability of hormones in the body, which is bad luck, and the body gives itself a trip.
But official crime data show that women are still highly capable of controlling emotions and do not use emotional problems.
It's not just blood, it's got a broken womb.
The thinest inner membrane after the period, and then it gets thicker, and it can be understood that the womb is a house, building a house every month (heavy internal membrane) is ready to meet guests, and the guests are not here, and all of them will be built next month, and then they will be built again next month.
Menstruation is inconvenient, bleeding 24 hours a month for decades, 24 hours a month, and a stomach pain. Who would like to?
But a man was born because his mother had a period to prepare you to live in a house for 10 months when you first came to this world, and you would like to thank your mother for being a healthy period.
A lot of women used to be pressured, society brainwashed women as dirty, ashamed, and people thought it was like that, but times changed.
If anyone feels sick of menstruation and that the female body's preparation for life is disgusting, it should not be said in the public, the girls stand up, don't think so, never experience it, and they don't know much about men in their lives, don't be so ungrateful, how can this attitude be so good to face her mother and want your own child?
Finally, the sisters try the tampons. It's really good.
It's winter to holiday. It's more disappointing to send mistakes.
I'm gonna order another meal for the kids.
I hope the store is busy checking the product.
Is it a leak in the bath tub?
The choice of the right foot bath can be a good foot therapy, and today the U.S. editor will answer this question and hope it will help our friends.
As people become more aware of health care, the baths are becoming more popular with consumers, and a large number of different products have emerged in the market, from 100 to thousands of dollars in foot baths, giving consumers a lot of options.
On the surface of the data, health-care electricity sales such as foot baths are hot compared to traditional household electricity, but there are no specialized industry standards and therefore have some safety risks.
"It's too dangerous to bubble feet in the water with electricity!"
Mr. Lee told the press that he recently bought a bath tub for his father's birthday present, but his father felt numb when he made his feet.
Mr. Lee initially thought it was the vibration function of the tub, and he didn't think it was a vibration function, and my father felt numb.
Mr. Lee tried it with a pen, and Mr. Lee was surprised to find the water in the tub with electricity.
He contacted the merchants, and the merchants were doing well, and Mr. Lee was still upset despite the return of the bath.
Because he found out that this long-standing bath is now set at the highest temperature, and which applies to the population, whatever material is not harmless, etc., there is no clear and detailed industry provision.
But normally the bath tub is not equipped with electricity, but it does not rule out a few products that are not strictly shut down when they leave the factory.
So, when you buy it, you choose a split bath.
Water and electricity separation, no safety risks.
And you can take a pen.

Its review of ethics is not based on the theory of premonition, but from the investigation of the actual moral subjects and the true choices observed, which have contributed to all the moral factors of this choice, which is the ethical perspective held by the social community).

NUMBER's received. It's a missing food.
The sheep's twilight, born in the sheep's moon, the sheep's grass, the sheep's grass, they're called "Uncle sheep."
Because of the publication of the "Thai Spicy" series of "Thai Spicy" in the "Indian Insight" "Japan Insight Record" and "Korea Spicy" in the industry, he claims to be "good at a serious bullshit."
"The Black under the Light," also known as the Chinese Insight, "The Smuggler" takes you deep into the bone marrow of Chinese folk, and the legends that have been heard so far, how sad and moving love is so beautiful behind it?
The South Xiao Building, the Moonless, has once again opened a journey of death, and their life is about to be revealed.
The "Suspicious" sheep have made their hair white and accumulated millions of best-selling books!
The original edition of the Chinese Insight Record, the new work after the Alien Password, the same author, the same lead, continues the story of the "Thai Insight" "Indian Insight"!
That's less. You need money for a McLea chicken sauce.
You asked the restaurant to bring it up.
I just don't want to go downstairs and buy things to pay for takeout.
Ting Zi: To friends.
I sincerely thank your friends for their humanitarian assistance during more than 30 years after the death of our loved ones, especially since I sent humanitarian assistance to our friends and abroad in early 1994, in my personal name, and have not been interrupted.
Now most of the victims' old parents have been granted their lives, and the leftovers have grown up to work.
It's your duty to help our families through the hardest times.
The new coronary epidemic is now raging globally, and most donors have retired annually.
So I sincerely ask you to suspend the humanitarian donation of the Tiananmen Mothers Group, which should have been a perfect end for this humanitarian aid.
I will always remember your love and believe that your will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way. Please understand!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
The Taoist Press: Allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the history of 32 years of humanitarian assistance from the All-American Federation (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the course of humanitarian assistance, the All-American Union and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the implementers of the project often cross.
(Apple Daily: Tiananmen Mother's website is run by pottery.) Pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
The rescue money is often not delivered to six or four.
In 1994, Mr. Ding suggested that a specialized group was established by Mother Tiananmen to integrate and receive and distribute the assistance funds in charge.
In 1998, the MCDF established the Six Four Orphan Education Fund, which was implemented 11 years later, in 2009, after graduation from all six or four orphans, the MCDF subsequently established the "Six-four Lonely Poor People's Specially Poor Families Relief Fund" and has been implemented to date.
These projects are funded mainly from campus and social donations in the year of 64, generous contributions from individuals and supported by the Brothers University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labour Research Foundation.
Until last year, 31 years later, the six or four families finally received a portion of the donation raised in Hong Kong in the name of 64.
During this period, China's Human Rights also independently implemented their humanitarian assistance projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding called for a six-four donation to consider donors, and we are indeed retired elderly people who have not earned as well as they were before retirement, and I would like to thank Mr. Ding for his letter of "Friends".
We will respect the decisions of the hard-to-go, terminate the project within two years and recover immediately if needed.
Thank you and pay tribute to those who have been willing to deliver humanitarian aid for years, who have been taking risks.

How do I pay?
The re-transmitment has been delivered.
No rider's receiving it.
Now the restaurant clerk calls me.
A programming white that wants to share personal experience.
If you're going to go to this industry, you can choose to go to a place to train, but if you don't think about it, it's better to learn yourself, after all, and it takes six months to study.
But if training is intended to go into this industry is a very good option, especially those who are self-control and their weak, and training is a very good option.
If you're more self-control, you can choose to learn from yourself, but you're tired.
It's important to choose a good training institution, of course.
First of all, it depends on the strength of this institution, and if the teacher is not strong enough, the training institution is of no point, of course, and some new training institutions are not particularly strong.
Second, look at this training facility before choosing, and it's better to check out students from this institution, and only students in the institution know what it's like, and the course is good or bad.
Hello, I don't know how to answer that question, because there's no introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with the individual's own situation.
For example, professional, age, language to learn, even in which city, these have something to do with the industries you learn or want to do.
If you're a student and you haven't graduated, or a computer profession has graduated, then if I have enough time to recommend self-learning, this is the least efficient and cost-effective, and there are many sub-line training institutions that are actually good, but it takes more time to study, and it takes a lot of training for three to six months.
But if I say these things, self-learning is convenient, and now many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are many training resources to go to station b, and if you don't find resources, you can contact me by profile, get free resources, or detailed advice.
There are also more classic books that combine video-based learning.
If you're not a computer profession, but you can pay for some money and time costs, then it's recommended to study in training institutions, so it doesn't have to be hard to learn, and the teacher's talk is detailed, and there are questions that can be answered, and they can help with learning planning or supervision.
And now a lot of training institutions sign employment agreements, with internal push numbers, and then they're recommended to the company, so that the interview to find a job later will save a lot of things.
That's some of my ideas, and I'm not sure I know you, so it's not detailed, but if you have anything else you want to consult, you can contact me at any time.
I said, "One o'clock." I saw it in App.
What do you mean?
I'm not done yet. What are you doing?
I, take over (installation, cleaning, repair), wall-mounted water heaters, water purification machines, washing machines, air conditioning, toilet, stoves, smokers, lamps, glass polishing, professional stitches, domestic service
Thank those who gave me a little bit of praise, for their hard work for their lives, but for continuing.
Life doesn't fail everyone who works hard, watch me if you like it. Thank those who give me a compliment.

The Chinese Shatzers joined forces to organize the first biannual exhibition of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua Network
The first biannual exhibition of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia on December 12th, Riyadh, was officially opened to the public in the Direye JAX art district in north-west Riyadh, Saudi capital, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, etc.
The biannual exhibition was co-organized by the Saudi Direier Biannual Exhibition Foundation and the UCA Yurens Center for Contemporary Art in China, and the director of the UCA Yullens Centre for Contemporary Art in China, as director of the art director.
According to the team, the theme of this biannual exhibition was " Touching Stones across the River " , a metaphor for reform strategies in the transition of socio-economic economies, and reflected the current situation in Saudi socio-cultural development.
The biannual exhibition, which covers nearly 12,000 square metres, is located across six connected buildings, with six units: " Touching the Rock across the River " as an experiment " on the edge of thinking " towards the public " " " " " " " " " " " "The Spirit of the Art " .
Of these, 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40 per cent of the total number of exhibits, including various forms such as painting, device art and performing arts; 12 Chinese artists are equally concerned, and some artists use recycled materials in an innovative way, such as Xu Ice's endless map of the stream of the story series (2014), re-engineered a classic mountain water painting with waste.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Direier Biannual Exhibition Foundation, Buckley, expressed the hope that this biannual exhibition would establish an international dialogue to give global viewers the opportunity to understand the flourishing cultural industries and creative communities of Saudi Arabia and to strengthen their interaction.
Tanyu said: " The goal of the Biannual Fair is twofold, which allows Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and to integrate Saudi viewers into the contemporary world ... "
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the opening week of the biannual exhibition, artists, mentors and opinion leaders in creative industries will discuss cross-cultural exchanges, contemporary art development, etc.

Yunnan: Integrated regulation of rural public interest job management - Xinhua Network
On December 12th, Xinhua, Kunming, has introduced policies to promote rural public interest management to help promote rural public interest job management to help fully advance rural rehabilitation.
The head of the Yunnan People ' s Social Department described the current development of 4.483,000 rural public interest jobs in Yunnan for the placement of rural difficult groups such as the de-poor labour force and playing an important role in helping people out of poverty to increase employment, consolidate the results of the fight against poverty and effectively enhance rural public service capacities.
The new regulation was issued jointly by the Yunnan People ' s Society, Rural Renewal, Finance, etc., to regulate the scope of recruitment of rural public goods at the grass-roots level, financial management, job development, job management, etc.
In terms of job development, the new rules are clear that the principles of "one person, voluntary disclosure, unified management, total control " who develops, who uses, who is responsible for "one person, voluntary public, unified management".
Recruitment procedures must be conducted in accordance with the procedures, declarations, audits, publicity, recruitment, pre-service training and placement of entry.
In addition, the new regulations identify specific responsibilities of the main development sector of rural public interest jobs, the criteria for subsidies and subsidies for rural public interest jobs, which provide that rural public interest job development departments should purchase business insurance for rural public interest job placements; requires the authorities to monitor the distribution of rural public interest benefits on a regular basis.
Wrong address.
Hello.
Can you cancel the order?
I'll re-order it.
Is it cancelled?
Two, although the right side has a great age in history, it's not long, so it's short because it's bright and sweaty; it's a little bit of a shock, and it's a little bit of a blow.
But to be honest, the right side has played a positive role in social progress.
The positive meaning of the right-wing should not be rejected in ending the definition of truth standards, the development of the economy for science and technology and the promotion of administrative institutionalization and human rights guarantees.
Three, for me, despite some of Lee Weidong's statements, I care about his statement and respect Lee Weidong; because he's serious, he's serious about China, and he's serious about China's social problems.
But I object to his anti-communication theory, and I think that the counter-necess revolution is bound to lead to social unrest, damage to the lives of the people, and the political group is mixed with mud, and then foreign countries enter in.
Four, change or improve China's attitude towards patience and responsibility for the people, political speculation attempts to take chestnuts, not right, asshole.
Talk about the left.
Left, actually a bunch of times and politics abandoned children.
If right is positive about society, the Communist Party will listen to some right words and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left is not made of it, because the left is the worst that the Communist Party threw away!
Five, I've seen some friends who have been trying to fight their left, and they're pretty excited, and I don't think it's necessary.
Don't try to be reasonable with a traitor and a left. It's all a twilight.
And don't try to prove that we're right, let alone let the traitors and the left-hand admit it. Why?
I told my friends that when the traitor scolds you 50 cents, when the left is scolding your right dog, it proves that our middle path is right!
Many young people have ideals when they're old, they forget ideals, or pursue ideals, but they become paranoid.
And the ideals are moving away, even the dragons are the dragons.
I think it's usually restraint and freedom, and China should be left from the ancient genes of history and culture.
And the right-wing freedom in the country, efficiency and development, the left side strengthens regulation, more equity and security.
Now society wants to focus more on equity, while China and the United States are fighting, and the left is positive, and it's estimated to last for years.
I can't read it. It's over.
Nothing. Flowers are just like this.
In the last two years, the American Emperor's blockade and siege of the Chinese chip have not only caused China to an unprecedented dilemma, but also a huge loss to the American company.
The US Emperor has crushed the Chinese chip industry and requires its own and allies to block the chip industry at the same time, with the direct consequences of the impact of global chip suppliers' orders and profits, resulting in reduced research and development inputs from chip producers and reduced capacity, resulting in disorders in the global shortage of chip supply chains.
Now, the core shortage has reached all major industries around the world, such as the parking company, the price of mobile phones, almost all the chips used.
To master the ownership of the chip, more and more technology giants in countries are beginning to move towards "de-pretty".
To hold control of global semiconductor control, to hold the development of the semiconductor industry in China, the recent old American-American movement has been hosting the Chip Summit; it is also inviting 64 giants to form semiconductor alliances and to raise money to support the giants of American native technology, such as Intel, the old American technology giant Intel, to take back its dominant position in the chip field, to build two crystal round processing plants in Arizona, USA, and to open up chip substitutes.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on the power build-up and is likely to take away the "work" of the power.
It's so certain that Intel, as an old American technology giant, has been working deep in semiconductors for decades, with a large number of talent and technical reserves that must rise rapidly in the short term and defeat the power build.
However, with regard to Intel's decision, the founder of the power build-up, Zhang Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Z
At the 2021 Masters Think Tank Forum, held in April this year, Zhang Zhong was amazing, and it was ironic that Intel built the chip factory.
Zhang Zhong-sung is very unsatisfied about Intel's entry into the crystal circle because Zhang is still concerned about a grudge against the front desk power build and Intel for over 30 years.
Intel was the jewel of the American manufacturing industry in the '60s and 1970s, the world's top in the world's semiconductor.
By the 1980s, the world's semiconductor high-end chips had been controlled by a few strong people.
The semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip was designed, made to seal it by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
But this model has overburdened some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face huge production line construction costs.
With market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to work together, and in 1984 Zhang Zhong was told that there was a company dedicated to chip design, it was possible to establish a factory dedicated to crystal circle manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhong's idea became a reality, and the power was created.
The power build-up targeted the main camp at the single link of the crystal round processing, not designed, provided only the substitute services for crystal circle manufacturing.
The power just created was small in front of Intel's giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhong was looking for Intel, but when Intel heard that the power build was only made in the chip industry, it was clear that it was very self-righteous, despised the power build-up, and decisively refused to invest in the power build.
Zhang Zhongshu also found Intel despised the service of the crystal circle.
I didn't think I'd look down on the giants of the crystal circle manufacturing service, but now I'm going to start working on the crystal round.
So, Zhang Zhong-chul thinks Intel's entry into the Jing Rounder is ironic.
The market value of power is now more than Intel.
Intel is naturally afraid to hold itself in the face of a strong attack on power.
Now, the power has been sprinting at 3 nm chips, and Intel is still in 14 nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
I'm not waiting.
At 19:06, it's two hours.
I'm looking at some weird hot search today.
What's normal love?
Random selection of three heat searches: February 2nd, the price increase in the price of the good friend, the cargo lesbian event, the spread of the twilights form the peak, and then [indicative decline] (sliding curve) eventually faded, and if the second-born love is created, the camel peak will appear again.
They seem to be different from the web-based network of officials.
What's an unusual relationship?
Select six heat searches in the same event randomly, showing [unique peaks], [saw teeth], [crawling].
[Single Peak] is man-made, fast hot search, which is a matter of public concern; [saw teeth] is periodic heating, ensuring that the topic is hot search lists; [crawling] is a collective evacuation, which is "functional" and has received new tasks and runs towards a new battlefield.
Figure 9, the heat peaks of one event happen to be the valley of another event, the time in seconds, must be a unified batch of sailors to launch a new round of offensives.
The specialization of black PR is visible: dozens of hot searches are on the list, which attracts attention, which are responsible for science, what leads to war, what is the transfer of vision, what affects perception, what misled judgements, which incite emotions, which black-producing decisions, black-producing accounts in batches, finely fighting in nodes, taking into account almost all elements of the spread of the situation.
Dissemination is a science, a stand-off, emotional subjective factor, and black PR alone is invisible.
Whoever walks through, it's a trace, and we dig it out together.
Data source: Hot search time machine.
For the first time in countries like Mauritius, the Omikron drug plant infection was discovered - Xinhua Network
Xinhua, Beijing, 12 December, reported that the first time in Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi reported that cases of infection in the Omikron drug plant of the new coronary mutation virus were detected.
Mauritius first reported two cases of Omikron drug infection in the country on 10 days.
According to Mao Minister of Health, Kalesh Jagutpar, one infected person arrived in Mauritius on 27 November; the other infected was a local resident of Mauritius, who was positive on 30 November after contact with a person who returned to South Africa recently.
After hospital isolation, both infected persons have turned negative and are now returning to their respective places of residence.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced that the country had first confirmed three cases of Omikjong poisoning.
These three were students, who traveled abroad early this month, and were not admitted to hospital due to light illness.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omikron drug plant, the government has been increasing its control.
From 6 December to 10 January next year, passengers over 12 years of age who entered the air are required to be tested at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health also announced on 10 days that children aged 5 to 11 years of age in the country would begin to be vaccinated against Pfizer's new crown vaccine.
On 9th day, the Minister of Health of Malawi, Kunbize Chiponda, said that three cases of Omikron poison were first detected in the country.
The country ' s health sector sequenced 12 new coronary positive samples collected from 9 November to 2 December, and found three cases of infection.

First, a friend introduced it because of trust, so I chose to see that my budget was 70,000 for basic renovations.
Come to the store and start a series of tricks.
I first came to the store and showed them my household chart, and they didn't go to the field to measure the house, and they could offer me that my 135 million house was okay, and probably showed me their materials and they didn't know what brand they were.
Their second trick is that you'll drag you to pay the deposit if you get to the store.
When I hesitated to pay the down payment, they invite their so-called managers to tell you how much you can give you today if you pay the down payment.
This is a big pit, and I'm a living example of being deceived, and I'm paying more than 10,000 down payments when I'm impulsive.
He gave me a lot of questions about 70,000, not water and electricity, not any door and cabinet bathroom, and these three are the cost of the base.
Besides these service points, they charge higher than any other company.
I lost trust in this company, and I signed the contract without knowing anything.
When I went to them to return the money, they showed experience, and they had a special little team to deal with you.
They're not responsible for the client's problem anyway.
There's a lot of details about the responsibility, and I don't want to say tears, but I don't choose them because my friends find their houses that are not good, and they'll charge you all the costs later.
Father, they're the old liars, and now they're beautiful, and they're closed and they're going to be something else.
So don't choose the renovation company like this.
You'll have to look at these consultations when you choose because the renovation isn't small money.
If you want to ask the merchants, please log in or register first.
The publication of various forms of business reviews is strictly prohibited. See the business entry statement for details.
The public comment is that the Kunming Renovation Design Channel provides you with 360 integrated home-dressing addresses, telephones, business hours, etc., looking for a renovation company, and a public comment.
If you're so scary, cancel the order in 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? Like, change the address?
Okay, then don't cancel this conversation, and if you don't refund my money for five to ten days, you'll be held accountable.
I asked if it could be cancelled in less than 15 minutes.
The saliva chicken should be ripe, but it's raw meat.
The stars have about 14th of the twin meteor showers - Xinhua Network.
On December 12th, Xinhua, the expert in the Astronomical Science (Reporter Zhou Yun Jian) described as the last massive meteor shower of the year, and the twin meteor showers of one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere will be a great event on December 14, and friends who like meteor showers to observe the night after that day.
Beijing Astronomers, Angu, were filmed in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the meteor showers are periodic comets, but the mother object of the Gemini meteor shower is the same as asteroid 3200, a Apollo asteroid.
Gemini meteor shower is also known to be the second meteor shower that is not born by comets.
The director of the Astronomy Society of Tianjin, the Astronomical expert, Shuli Peng, said that, like the big picture of the age, the Gemini meteor shower usually appeared at the end of the year, and that the "show period" could last until December 17th.
The meteor shower, known for its high flow and stability, is known as the three meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, together with the walrus shower.
One of the saloon meteor showers is that meteors are slow, colorful, fire meteors are many, both visible and suitable for astronomical photography.
The Twin Star showers in Tianjin City, Yang Zheng, were filmed in Tianjin State on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini meteor shower will be at about 1500 hours on December 14, at a great time of ZHR (the number of meteors can be seen per hour when the radiation point is above the top of the head) at 150.
Gemini meteor shower recommended index map.
" Last year, the twin meteor shower of the "scramble" impressed people, but this year's Gemini meteor showers will be disturbed by moonlight, and a little discount will be a little bit of a discount.
On November 11, the moon is full of moons, bright moonlights can interfere with observations, so that the moon falls in the second half of the night, and the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower will rise even higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe the hours behind the end of the night, but be careful to keep the cold warm. "
How can more meteors be observed as much as possible?
"Not recommended for urban observations, choice of a high altitude, small light, north-east view can be selected in the suburbs or villages, and then wait patiently until the moon falls, and look at it.
It's important to note that Gemini meteor showers are in all directions, and they don't have to keep an eye on the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower.
Friends who like to shoot want to make a beautiful meteor shower, better choose the wide angle, the big arctic lens, and use high ISO and the maximum arctic.
Based on stability and continuity considerations, tripods, backup batteries and fast-door lines are also essential ... "
Shuli Peng reminds me.
What difference does laser and traditional television make in market positioning?
In my understanding, the subject's traditional television should mean LCD TV, while the difference between laser and LCD television in market positioning is two main points:
First, laser TV focuses on the big screen market.
Laser TV is clearly more focused on the big screen market than the full market of LCD TV, or laser television itself is a product of large screens.
Currently, mainstream LCD television sizes are 55 to 65 inches, while laser television is usually 75 inches or more, with a maximum of over 100 inches, fully meeting the user's demand for large screen colour.
In recent years, the global share of laser television exports and sales has increased, accounting for over 60% of the total television sales of 80 inches and above.
According to China's Econ projections, the laser and television market will grow by more than 140% by 2020, and continue to grow at a high rate.
The reason for having such good results in the big screen market is due mainly to the excellent performance of laser television in eye protection.
Based on the imaging of laser television, the light from laser light sources does not directly into the eyeball, and the imaging process is closer to the imaging of objects under natural conditions, and the irritation of eyes is smaller than the backlight of LCD TV.
The Chinese Institute for the Standardization of Electronic Technology, Cesi Laboratory and Beijing and the Beijing Association and Hospital ophthalmologists, have produced 144 sets of test data through strict comparison tests of laser television and LCD television under the same conditions of the population.
Data confirm that laser television does have a strong eye-protective feature, and has even some improvement in particular.
In the moment where visual health is increasingly valued, laser television attracts more and more users not only with eye-protective advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the colour market.
Second, laser TV focuses on the high-end market.
Contrary to the price of LCD TV, the price of laser television is mostly sold in over a million dollars, and prices are rising as size and light source upgrades.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It must be a good idea.
With the evolving level of light and technology, laser television has many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD TV and projection.
With ultra-short focal-range projection technology, laser television projection distance is shorter than traditional projectors, capable of achieving a 100-inch screen experience within a short distance, which requires little space and small host occupancy.
In terms of brightness, large-brand laser television can reach above 2,000.
And the heat is lower, the equipment is low, the TV has a longer life.
Besides, many high-end laser television machines carry a lot of front-line technologies such as real 4K super-high-resolution paintings, artificial intelligence systems, bioscreens, which can bring users more powerful audio-visual experience.
If you don't talk about false needs, it's a product that needs to be broken down, and laser TV is not a video player's dish, and if you want to balance the screen and watch the environment, you can try, everything is good or bad, and you can weigh your own judgment, and you're afraid of listening to the word.
In short, the super-wide angle near-focal projector -- laser TV -- had to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and mirrors to close the screen -- which does not fit the best optical design.
To block some of the environmental light, using microstructure Finnel curtains, it's expensive, and 80 inches of price is basically a 65-inch liquid crystal.
And one thing, I hate projectors for selling points with a reflection to their eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is a direct light for the eyes, and you can't see it on the ceiling, and you can't see it, and you don't have to be more real LCD TV, and it's not even lighted on the TV ceiling?
And, if it wasn't a reflection, it wouldn't be like it.
It's really hard to ignore the heat spots of the high-benefit curtain, and it's hard to reflect a lot of light from one angle to the eyes.
The best quality shop at the Visual Aesthetics Gallery has not yet had a branch.
With the date of the micro-mail appointment, the little sister sent me the optional schedule, and the response was more timely.
Before I went to the store, more outdoor wedding dress, beautiful, and it was a lot of style.
When I arrived that day, I had a simple exchange of ideas with my little sister, very patiently, and finally finalized the start of makeup.
But maybe because I didn't talk to me about specific filming ideas, so I didn't want the style, but it was supposed to be a nice twilight.
When the photographer is done, the photographer will help pick the photos, communicate later style, and feel very careful.
It's about half a month to fix it. Sit down and wait.
The second time I got a real-life meal, most of the clothes on the whole show could choose a shot.
Finally, a black dress was chosen to experience different styles.
The whole shoot takes about two hours, makeup plus shooting, and the photographer who's responsible for filming is a brother after 95, feeling a little bit green, hoping to give more advice after customer filming action guidance.
The best quality shop at the Visual Aesthetics Gallery.
It's on the front page. Let's see Queenie.
You fill out your name and call at the store, you can choose the dress, you can choose the dress, you can choose three or four clothes, you'll be patient, you've been making up for a long time, and you'll be able to do it.
[Environment] The whole thing is fine.
There's plenty of clothes to choose.
There's almost three makeup positions, and there's a studio in there.
[service] Very passionate and careful.
The modeler is patient.
The photographer will teach you how to move.
Unsatisfied, the photographer will also present a re-shoot.
[Experience] Maybe it's a little over-form, and the eyelids were put on three eyelids.
The eyebrows are shaved, a little awkward for the daily unpainted.
The photo was given for 10 days, but the P-chart didn't work very well, and it felt that the eyelids were still obvious.
Because I don't know what style I want, I tried two sets, and I picked it out, or did I pick up a black dress?
I've been working on my hair since I picked my clothes, and the hairdresser and the make-up sister are so patiently helping me get it, and it's very satisfactory.
I started taking pictures after I got my hair.
After the film, I picked four of my favorites as a fine one, and my little brother said it was 15 inside, and it ended with a very satisfactory ending.
No reply on 3rd day... because your system cannot identify my credit card, I can't join a monthly fee scheme!
The strangest thing is, I use the same credit card every time I pay.
I'm paying the freight every time.
You can get an exemption, and then you'll charge my monthly fee after your investigation.
Little umbrellas for insurance. Is that good?
The umbrella is an Internet insurance broker platform.
In terms of setting conditions: in accordance with the instructions of the Regulation of Insurance Brokers (revised 2015), becoming an insurance broker must meet three key words: shareholders, sponsors have no significant record of violations for the last three years, with a minimum limit of 50 million yuan to be established and must be agreed by the China Insurance Board.
These three are actually harsh, and it's about strength, with the approval of the State authority of the Silver Insurance Board (supervising insurance companies, banks) and shareholders need to be good, as small umbrella insurance for insurance brokers, and the insured have to question whether small umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, with these three thresholds, and not all insurance companies can reach.
It's good at this point, it's trustworthy.
From the insurance product: Small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies are sold on this platform, such as the latest top-up and Thai Super Marie 5, the claimant and the insured party are both Thai life, and small umbrella insurance is a third-party broker, without questioning its spectrometry.
In terms of the payment model: Internet platform products, which are generally expensive for Internet products because of the cost of operating networks and the cost of business staff, are generally expensive for Internet products and flexible payment methods, supporting monthly payments, reducing the pressure of the insured contributions while maximum leverage of insurance.
That's still very good.
I can think about it.
From the professional level of operators: this is particularly important, because insurance is a highly demanding industry where many Internet product clients can insurance themselves, which there are many errors in health notification and occupation, where non-insured practitioners tend to add their subjective consciousness when they are insured, feel healthy or consistent, so that there are many risks of compensation that may be rejected.
I've done insurance phone sales myself in "Telephones" and I've been very responsible for telling you.
Internet insurance is real, and it's true, and it's not human, there are no professional practitioners in Internet channels, and there are many misdirected sales.
For example, $6 million in insurance insurance, insurance for mobile phones, free of charge, 60,000 heavy disease insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they don't tell the insured person that the first month, the next month is a normal charge, dozens to 200, and many clients have a deduction for a year or two.
Thought it would cost me a dollar, and the insurance company paid $6 million.
Free cell phones, special policy sections like 6666,88888, and if the winning text message is sent, it doesn't exchange, and no one's reminded.
It's short-term, and if it's on this, there's no other business insurance, and if that's the case, 60,000 can't solve the problem, and if that's the only way to do it, it's not gonna work.
The country is also fighting hard on the misdirection of Internet insurance sales.
So, in general, the platform is fine, the product is not wrong, and the problem is the professional and professional conduct of the operator.
The main subject of the proposal is carefully considered that many underline insurance brokers have a wider range of products, and more opportunities and products that clients can choose, and some products have better value than Internet products.
I've helped 59 Internet clients myself, under-line products, and each premium saves 2000-3000 yuan per year.
If you have any questions, you're welcome to communicate and communicate with me.
I: Mingya Insurance Broker, with three years of business management training experience, served nearly 1,000 business users, working with over 100 insurance companies, and before I go into insurance, I will customize insurance products for clients, insurance products for customers, and try to get the best nuclear insurance results for clients, and after insurance, I'll host them from the client's needs, and keep the client safe.
Growing up with every client for life.
I hope my answer will help the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance is the insurance business that the insured person can do all the insurance operations of the insurance process after clicking on the insurance link.
In the process, the insured person does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign, and all steps can be done by the insured person.
Although Internet insurance insurance is not too "several" and may not even have a print paper contract, it does not affect the validity and legal effectiveness of electronic contracts.
This pattern is kind of like a "telephone sales" water line operation, but there's a fatal problem with buying insurance, which is that follow-up services may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract for decades, and when we buy insurance, should we think about whether this "intermediate" we choose is a "insured broker" that can be with us for a long time, and will we be able to provide services for many years?
How do I get to the delivery commissioner?
It's almost 3:00.
Is that for me?
I said knock on the door and deliver the goods.
But the rider put it at the door and the man left.
And it's wrong.
Your rider has already taken me a takeout, but still informs the waiting.
The rider received my takeout at 19:25, but he still won't leave.
I'll get it. Do you want another takeout?
What do we do?
Where's your rider?
You want to wait?
I'm sending the order.
Okay, I'll call the police if you don't cancel.
But my food is safe and healthy.

Just get back the discount code.
No problem. Remember if you don't have to arrange a re-transmit. I've bought another one. I don't want to waste it.
Thanks for your help.
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of contempt and scolding, and I have not accepted such physical attacks.
In civilized society, we can accommodate everything, but we can put an end to this villain.
If you don't look at parties and factions, you have to resist first, it's an uncivilistic style.
Since you started sending Facebook and friends' requests, and then you've been making a tactful post, and I've been trying to put my place and father's name on social media.
You've been working hard on me not only at the frequency of six meals a day, but also on Facebook and your so-called friends are talking about some of my hidden, humiliated statements, appearances, body, good-breeding, and any bed strawberries, or any messages like that.
I've received a lot of friends who later sent a statement about your Facebook friend's account with a picture and sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't keep quiet.
You're getting more arrogant when I put the news on the police.
I don't care what political background you are, and whatever status you are, in our society, you need gender respect.
Yes, you can continue to say that you can continue to say that you're just caring and watching me, and you can continue to think it's not harassment, and you can even deny that it's not your drawings or keep making all offensive statements.
Yeah, I can't, I can't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't know you, and I don't need your face and body to judge.
I don't even think there's a girl who's willing to let someone else humiliate themselves so much for being famous.
Friends ask me, are you okay?
I said yes, you wouldn't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay when she's so bullied.
In work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic character can choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is self-righteous.
I've stopped some of the messages for you.
I don't think anyone can pretend to be you.
I can only say you're a civil enemy.
I'll laugh.

The three American carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam 2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional coverage: China-American Relations Update: The latest satellite images show that three United States carriers are gathering around China; the media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the United States Navy's weapons bank has rarely visited Guam, releasing important signals against allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank, the South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform, on January 9, the satellite discovered the American Army carrier Carl Vincent near the Strait of Barab.
The Barabak Strait connects the South China Sea to the Sulu Sea, a strategic point in the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
The platform expects the Carl Vincent to deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the carrier Carl Vincent has deployed the F-35C and the CMV-22 Fish Eagle.
The American carrier, which is now rising Pacific, is now in addition to the Carl Vincent, the American carrier from the United States on January 3rd.
Lincoln also carried the F-35C squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th United States Marines.
In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan carrier, which is docked in Japan.
The carrier's battle group also includes missile cruisers, the Stokedar missile destroyer, etc.
On January 17, 2022, the South China Strategic Situation Awareness Platform published the latest satellite picture showing that three American carriers are gathering around China.
The three American carriers gathered the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam on January 17, 2022, the American ship carrier CMV-22B flight route.
According to CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the United States Navy's weapons bank was rarely visited Guam last weekend.
The Ohio class nuclear submarine, which carries 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, USS Neveda, entered the United States Navy Base last Saturday (15 January).
The three carriers gathered the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam, and analysed that this was a signal to allies and enemies in an increasingly tense situation in India-Pacific.
This is the first time that the United States ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three American carriers have gathered the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam, and China has built a large number of military facilities in the South Saudi Islands in recent years.
The map shows China's Young-sun Island in the South Sand Islands.
In its statement, the United States Navy stated that the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada had strengthened cooperation between the United States and regional allies, demonstrated the capacity of the United States, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly known as Boomer submarine.
The whereabouts of 14 Thundering Submarines in the United States Navy are usually strictly confidential.
The secret surrounding ballistic missile submarines made the Thundering Submarine the most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad, which also includes well-launched ballistic missiles located on the mainland of the United States, as well-launched bombers such as B-2 and B-52.
Talk to friends about the recent Meta drop of 26 per cent, market value evaporating $251 billion, and Zuckerberg responded to "to face unprecedented competition" for why?
Meta is essentially an advertising company that earns mainly from advertising, and today's advertising company has a flow channel.
Facebook, Instagram, whatsapp, etc., whatever functional location, is Meta's traffic channel.
Not only that, Meta is the largest "advertising union", and many Apps are on Meta's ads, and they're going to make it happen through Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, Meta has difficulty getting data from users because of apple privacy policy adjustments, affecting the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's privacy policy is now user-friendly, and it's obvious that users allow App to access their own information, and most people's normal reactions are certainly not allowed.
Next, if Google stabs again, it'll have a greater impact on Meta's income.
Second, the Chinese factor in the previous growth of Meta's income has also weakened (how high the weight of this factor is uncertain, but does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but that's not accurate.
Meta's income comes from China every year, mainly by Chinese companies that make maritime operations.
Meta has about hundreds of people in Hong Kong's office, and there are a few big agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is a big advertising channel, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, now byte TT is one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from bytes for the last two years.
All agents in the country are helping bytes to go to Meta, and Meta's doing a great job in the Great China.
I haven't been special lately, but I'm sure it's not better than before.
The Chinese company's stage of massive burning money abroad is over.
Third, the new traffic channels are not expanding well.
Facebook is getting older, and the new platform, including TT, is not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets are not just looking at middle income, but more importantly, what is expected in the future.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg told the universe.
The universe should be one of the future directions, but the universe's realization cycle is longer, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in two or three years.
So for the next two years, it's supposed to be Meta's more difficult time.
Don't look at Facebook now, and there's $100 billion to $200 billion a year in revenue, and Facebook is now very crisisy, and there's no safe moat river compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although his social software is now working more daily and mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has little confidence in Facebook, which is blinking between subversions.
And the vision of the universe, which is beyond the reach of the universe, has no hope of success in a short time, so Facebook is very dangerous, and that's why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company, and it's the root reason for the new track, but I think his track is wrong, and it's a little bit of my thinking, for information.
