A 28-year-old cook was found dead at a mall in San Francisco.
A 28-year-old cook who moved to San Francisco recently was found dead this week in the stairwell in a local mall.
But the victim's brother said he couldn't think of anyone who wanted to hurt him and said, "It's finally okay."
According to the San Francisco coroner's office, the body found at the Westfield mall on Wednesday morning was confirmed as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco.
San Francisco Police Department claims that the death case was found killed and was under investigation.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told the BBC radio station KGO that Frank, who was a waterline cook in Boston, found an ideal job for a water cook six months ago at Sons & Daughters' restaurant in San Francisco.
A spokesman at Sons & Daughters said they were "very shocked" about Frank's death.
The spokesman said, "We are a small team of close families, and we will miss him so much."
At this sad moment, we express our deep sympathy and condolences to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank was initially living in a guest house, but recently, "It's finally okay."
Louis Galicia told KGO, "Frank found an apartment while dating a girl."
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to hurt his brother.
Frank has a good heart and a wide heart.
Louis Galicia says, "Frank often cooks dinner for his family."
He never wanted to argue with his family.
He's a man of opinion.
Louis Galicia says, "All things in the world can go wrong, but Frank calls it a man who glows every day."
Any leads are requested to call the San Francisco Police Department report number 415-575-4444.
Primary doctor strike: calling for new labour action
The junior doctor's representative called on the Alliance to approve its new labour action against new contractual disputes.
The British Medical Association Junior Doctors Committee will require all its members to support more labour since early September.
The Junior Doctors Board stated that ministers had not resolved their concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical science were born in July to resist contract transactions with the British Medical Association.
Of the voting members, 58 per cent opposed the contract transaction.
Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Junior Doctors Committee, in a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, stated that the government was "stained" on the issue that led to the resistance of the contract.
She said, " In view of this, the Executive Committee of the Junior Doctors Committee has voted to reject the proposed new contract and called for formal consultations on all concerns ... "
In response to the silence of the Government, the Executive Committee of the Junior Doctors Committee officially requested today the Council of the British Medical Association to convene a special session to approve a long-term plan aimed at upgrading labour operations from early September.
The dispute has led to the participation of junior doctors in six strikes this year, including the first full strike in the history of the British National Medical Services System.
Dr. Johann Malawana, a junior doctor leader of the British Medical Association, resigned after voting resisted the contract agreed terms recommended by the British Medical Association.
In a meeting before 54,000 junior doctors and medical students voted, he said to members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should therefore be accepted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt stated that the contract would be enforced among English medical personnel.
Russia and Turkey: "No Union"?
A gesture ends a crisis.
Russia met with Turkish leaders on Tuesday, shaking hands and announced the official closure of eight months of saliva and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin met the Turkish President in a glorious hall of the palace of St. Petersburg, I felt strongly: this settlement was the most promising thing Ankara would like to see.
Yes, both sides did shake hands.
However, even according to the criteria of Mr. Putin's constant constriction, Putin is just a shallow smile, barely showing enthusiasm.
Regep Taip Erdoan reportedly mentioned Putin five times.
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would return to pre-crisis levels, even higher.
The next day, this newspaper wrote that Mr. Erdoan was acting like nothing happened.
But I think his passion suggests something opposite.
However, Mr. Putin's constant coldness means he didn't forget anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow was very responsive.
Mr. Putin has been slamming the incident and accused Ankara of secretizing Moscow behind his back.
Attacks from so-called friends are even more unacceptable.
It's hard for both sides to build real trust.
Since November, the Russian public opinion has also reversed.
For months, government-controlled media have launched an alarming and full attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
The most serious of these is the accusations from senior officials: Mr. Erdoan's family profited from illegal oil transactions in the so-called Islamic State-controlled Syrian region.
He's already denied that.
However, news from St. Petersburg shows that it's time to move on.
After all, this meeting is provided that Putin received an apology from Turkish President Erdoan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of truce are obvious.
First, Erdoan was thrown off the stage after the coup failed last month, so he needed the support of all his friends.
The constant terrorist attacks have apparently hit him.
And there's economic motivation.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey very much, especially the ban on charter services that can transport millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
As the flight recovers, Russian travel agencies and charter companies will be relieved.
They'll be on the Mediterranean tour at the end of the season.
National television even predicts this week that once Turkish agricultural imports are re-enacted, the price of fruit and vegetables will decline.
A report by the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti says, "The tourists are gone, the tomatoes are back."
For Moscow, the visit was also of additional political value.
Ankara is angry at the weak reaction of the Western world to the intention to take over.
Moreover, Ankara is dissatisfied with the slow progress of accession to EU negotiations and Putin's long-standing involvement, and Putin is keen to take advantage of political colds and weaken Turkey's relations with the Western world.
As a result of the failure of the coup to support elected authorities, Russian leaders will be given a score of Ankara.
Note that this is a gift for Moscow, who has always been deeply afraid of regime change.
So, the meeting in this glorious seaside palace led Russia and Turkey to become allies between two countries that were rejected and abused by the Western world, and an analyst described it as "unincorporated."
However, despite public reconciliation, there are significant differences between the two sides.
Moscow has recently played a role in Syria, while Russia and Turkey support the opposite.
It is predictable that after almost three hours of initial conversation, the two presidents said at the launch that the topic had not yet been discussed.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the issue of differences between the two sides, while Putin stressed it.
There has been no clear consensus on how to agree on how to agree on Syria.
It is certainly a good thing that the leaders of the two countries are re-opening dialogue with months of open hostility and causing a major disaster caused by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states Turkey to shoot down Russian warplanes.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve outside Scotland.
According to the CEO of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the Bank will be simplified to a logistics department.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve outside Scotland.
Ross McEun told BBC Scotland that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand was committed to its global ambition.
But eight years ago, it was nearing collapse and had to receive help and then gave up that quest.
In that time, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other consumer finance brands.
The group used millions of pounds to sponsor the football six and the Wembleton tennis championships, Andy Murray, and so on.
But now, the right thing to do is to make more national brands visible.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will use it for Scottish clients, but will not respond to the same.
In England and Wales, all references outside headquarters and stock exchanges will be changed to the National Westminster Bank.
The Alst Bank brand has been used for customers of the Republic of Ireland and the Autonomous Region of Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller and more prominent private bank brands, such as the Bank of Finance, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEun was interviewed on a tour of Inverness County clients and employees.
He told BBC Scotland, "The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand and one of the employees' hired brands, because we are now a bank with many brands."
Because the bank itself became an international brand, RBS became a global brand.
Now, what I'm saying is, we're not focusing on the world anymore, and we've turned our eyes to the mainland.
Each brand represents a difference in their respective industries, and our employees serve their clients through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has shown that it will not continue to sponsor the six-country championship; at the same time, efforts have been made to raise the image of different brands in sports events.
The CEO said, "Now it's time to become a multi-brand bank, because in private we've been looking for how to become a better bank for clients."
If we were to be a big bank with many brands three years ago, we would be mocked.
We're focusing on client needs and I believe you've noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands and it's time right now.
Deturi won 3,000 in New Markit's success with Prediaction.
Two victorys in Newmakit, Daturi, won 3,000, and then he sprayed champagne to celebrate.
Friday, the professional horse rider Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th victory in Newmarket.
He managed to run from John Gosden, who was in a hurry on the track, and he won two victorys that night, and he won 3,000 in his career.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional horse rider to achieve this milestone in the field of flat ground.
The first five are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion rider who won Ghayyar earlier said, "This is special."
I'm excited because my family was there.
I'm happy with what I did in New Markit, because I started here 30 years ago.
This is not a big race, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's just a regular Friday night with 20,000 viewers.
I'm glad and humble.
Deturi brought in after winning, and it caused the whole time to cheer.
In the area of barriers, two riders have achieved this achievement, namely, the champion rider Richard Johnson and Sir Anthony McCoy, who are now retired, of which Sir McCoy won over 4,300 in his record career.
Burger was the winner of the 9th German competition, and won 4,493 games in his career.
It's not surprising that Deturi was one of the best riders of the day, so it was not surprising that he had achieved it before him.
He's fashionable and strong, but what really made him out of the heavy room is his tactical reason.
He's a great horseman, and for years his passion and charm has attracted a lot of fans to the movement.
A few weeks ago, I told Deturi that if he wasn't just a weekend with a race rider, he should have won 6,000!
Seriously, Daturi is the best horseman in England in 30 years, and that's too important.
He's a lively man, and it's good for a British racer, but besides, he's an incredible rider.
Deturi celebrates this milestone with its landmark jump-down.
From jumping lines to jumping down horses, Deturi has been a typical representative of the British flat field for 20 years.
His career is like a roller coaster.
He won several championships, including the famous "seven-time victory" won by the Royal Asco Racer in 1996, but he was also hit by a crash and was banned from taking drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned to the game after the six-month ban, he had a hard time, but he showed a remarkable personality advantage and finally returned to the top, and he was the first to be a suspect.
He may not be able to do it too long -- Daturi said before he wanted to be at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putin dismissed Sergei Ivanov ' s post as Director of the Office
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov's President's office.
For years, Mr. Ivanov has been part of the core group that Mr. Putin has trusted.
Ivanov, 63 years old, is now appointed as Special Representative on Environment and Transport.
A statement by the Kremlin stated that Mr. Putin had "declared his post as Director of the Russian Presidential Office of Ivanov," but did not give a reason.
Anton Vaino, Deputy to Mr. Ivanov, has been appointed as his successor in 2012.
Mr. Vaino is 44 years old, a former diplomat.
He was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, and graduated from the famous Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he managed the President's draft and government staff, the Kremlin website (in Russian).
After his appointment, he said to Mr. Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the Government is to support the drafting of laws and control instructions by the Head of State.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr. Ivanov had asked for resignation and recommended Mr. Vaino to take over.
Is that a convincing smile?
Moscow is confused about this.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Putin's closest assistants, and, like Putin, worked for the Soviet Security Agency (KGB).
As Director of the Office, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on national television, both of them claimed that the director of the office had asked to resign.
Although smiling in front of the camera, almost no one believed it -- especially at this time before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the result of a defeat in some kind of power struggle?
I don't know yet.
But the official statement -- a man who was once considered a presidential candidate suddenly chose to take over Russia's environmental policy -- raises many doubts.
The Kremlin website quoted Mr. Ivanov's dialogue with Mr. Putin, and said, "Yes, in early 2012, I asked you to give me a difficult position, even a difficult position, a four-year term. "
"As a result, I've been Director of the Presidential Office for four or eight months. "
Mr. Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
Before that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.
He's a member of the Russian Security Council, and he's a former member of the NSA, like Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Mr. Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly the National Security Agency), Mr. Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Mr. Putin came to power, he appointed Mr. Ivanov as one of the five most trusted.
The outside world once thought that Mr. Ivanov might be President of Russia after Mr. Putin's second term, because the three re-elections were constitutional.
But this position was eventually attributed to another close assistant to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Before three and a half years later, Mr. Putin served as Prime Minister of Russia.
Mysterious fish are amazing, Buff. A garden.
A resident of Buff found fish in his garden and then sent help.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be a sand eel from the sea tornado.
Mr. Bain lives about 500 metres from the sea, and he posted this strange scene video on Periscap, hoping that someone would explain why these two inches of fish were there.
The Quince Ferry Bridge has now reached Fuff.
The project, which cost Pound1,35 billion, is scheduled to be completed in May 2017
Engineers have connected the North Bridge of Queensferry Crossing to the high bridge, which means that the bridge is now reached to Fuff.
The bridge windmill, located near the three bridgeheads of each bridge, is now near completion, and the project is the first bridge.
The bridge started with Fuff 600 meters long and weighing 30,000 metric tons.
It uses 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 tilt lassors.
The project, which cost Pound1,35 billion, is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
The Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the scene today and became one of the first people to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic moment in the construction of the Quinceferi Bridge."
We all witnessed the engineering work on such a huge project, using over 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel in this section of the bridge alone.
Although the bridge is large in size and weight, the dragon between the high bridge and the bridge needs fine work and requires very precise assembly.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge is now installed, and the concrete bridge on the last bridge is pouring in Rosyth today, which means that all the bridge is ready.
Michael Martin, Project Director of the Quince Ferry Bridge Construction Company, said, "No matter which bridge project, the first dragon is a major milestone."
In terms of this great project, the Dragon shows the front-line civil engineering technology.
After installing the last road panel and connecting it to the extended North Bridge Fort panel, the remaining gap dragons on the north side or near the land side.
The completion of this operation requires 700 mm south of the northern high bridge.
It's a huge operation, and it's a very sophisticated job.
It's huge because the high bridge is 222 meters long, weighing about 6,000 metric tons, and needs to pull out a slope of about 3%.
It's sophisticated because the engineering team needs to make sure the deviation is very small, and it's only a few millimeters each.
It's a relief that everything's going well.
Simon Bayers won the female gymnastics champion.
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the charade.
Simone Biles is not affected by all this.
When you jump, you're alive.
There's more to balance the upper edge of the wood.
Free gymnastics is amazing.
The whole thing was wonderful.
Now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won a full-time champion on Thursday, showing her talent in gymnastics leading the world in gymnastics.
She's got a total score of 62.198, the final Five team, Aly Raisman and the copper winner, Aliya Mustafina.
Simon Bayers from the United States performed a balanced wood performance at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Byers helped the American team win four-time games in the Olympic women's gymnastics, and she won five medals personally at the Olympic Games, and further confirmed that she was the generation, or the best gymnast in history.
When she saw his total score, Bayers couldn't help but cry, and she finally ended this long journey.
Byers was therefore among the same as Michael Phelps, who raised sports projects in their respective fields to a new height:
Byers has been in charge of the game for the last three years, winning 15 World Championships, including 10 gold medals. She's been training hard every day with her desire to achieve higher accuracy. Mary Lou Retton, the Olympic champion of 1984, said, "Byers is the best gymnast I've ever seen."
There's a last game in Brazil, but it's not like Bayers' competition with other gymnasts, it's a fight between her own and huge expectations.
If Bayers hadn't returned to her home in Spring, Texas, you'd be very disappointed.
Simon Bayers (left) from the United States hugged each other, who won gold and silver medals at the 2016 Summer Games, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August.
Byers won his first gold medal on Tuesday, giving a surprise gift to the upcoming national coach Martha Karolyi.
Although Byers insisted that he had no plan for the future in the process of taking over the championship for years, it was not exactly the case.
The part of Bayers' free gymnastics -- including the part of her landmark retrenchment, with Latin music, which she hears in a street away from Rio Olympic Hall.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl who was adopted by grandparents during the baby and discovered by the mother of the coach Aimee Boorman on a field trip to the gym, has grown into a strong force.
Byers hasn't missed the All-powerful game since summer 2013, and she'll win if he wants to win.
Mustafina's little lead after two rotations was just an illusion.
The world champion of the two projects balanced wood and free gymnastics, Bayers, is ambushed.
Her balance wood score 15.433, free gymnastics 15.933.
When waiting for the final score, Lesman took Byers gently, and when Byers learned what he wanted, he left tears.
Lesman's performance was kind of like revenge four years ago, when she was third, but she lost to Mustafina in the finals.
But this time, this 22-year-old captain, known as Grandma, was a long way ahead of the American play.
She flew to the crowd after her free gymnastics and declared her return, but sometimes there was doubt.
Since earlier this week, the news has spread like a virus on Twitter, and his life has been given a whole new meaning.
Mahaj Brown, six years old, was spared the shooting in Philadelphia.
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child who was shot was Mahaj Brown.
They say Brown's abdominal ditches, legs, arms and abdominal parts have multiple gunshot wounds, but the child is awake on his way to the doctor.
"He suffered a lot, and a little body was shot in a lot of holes," his grandmother Delores Melendez said to the TV station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has been operated on several occasions.
His family told the TV that the child was expected to recover.
He was going to start first grade in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Two of the other three were shot, 29 years old, 32 years old.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims is in critical condition; two other victims are stable.
According to the TV station, the child and the 29-year-old victim were found in front of the car.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police were investigating whether the wounded were shot.
The investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like a couple of shooters had a fire.
A lot of offensive weapons were found at the scene, so they could infer that they used different offensive weapons.
And it's certainly a constant war.
There's shell on both sides of the street.
"So, it shows that there were a number of armed men at the scene at the time, "The police chief of Philadelphia, Anthony Ginaldi, said to the TV station.
There are a lot of houses and vehicles damaged in the area.
No capture has yet been carried out, and the police are said to be watching the surveillance footage.
Tuesday, there was a six-year-old, who was shot in the arm when playing at the door of the West Oak Lane community.
She's recovering. The police are still chasing suspects.
Why do we need Simon, Gabrielle and Larry?
That's how I evaluate this year's women's Olympic gymnastics for more than one reason.
First, since 1984, I've been to every summer Olympics, but the United States has never been so dominant.
Second, the gymnastics team has three excellent gymnasts - Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, who have been inspiring many colored girls.
The formation of this team is proud of everyone, because it contains the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
This team finally looks like the American team.
It also consolidates the peak of black and Latino women in this movement.
For the last four years, the first female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabrielle were number one, second.
This is amazing.
Last Olympic Games, Gabriel Douglas, "unexpectedly" became the Olympic champion, which was a great cheer for America.
Today, the world can witness the remarkable performance of three world champions Simon Byers, Douglas and Larry Hernandez, who have played regular gymnastics into God.
Thursday, Simon helped the American team achieve four crowns on the Women's Personal Power Project.
Her teammate Ali Lesman won the silver medal.
We're at the top of the campaign, but not in the American gymnastics class.
Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie are on the Olympic team the same way as Ali and Madison.
They're the Final Five, because the next Olympic gymnastics will be made up of four gymnasts, which is Marta Karolyi's last year of teaching.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, where gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastics clubs, and their parents need to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions and hotel costs (including the associated costs of coaches and gymnastics and family), and the cost list is increasing.
Most gymnastics clubs are located in rich suburbs that support the industry.
All gymnastics' training is done in these clubs, and it's a long-term expensive cost for gymnast families.
The coach of Bayers, Aimee Boorman, and the coach of Hernandez, Maggie Haney, have been teaching them since these two gymnasts started practicing gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to young girls affected by Simon, Gabrielle and Larry.
Twenty years ago, I founded my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we provide free, cheap gymnastics to over 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Spanish Americans) in black residential areas and to develop national and world champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this learning opportunity and benefit from this great Olympic movement.
Gymnastics helps to develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, and also to develop a spirit, self-regulation and determination.
These can bring lifelong benefits to a person's health, study and success.
Inspired by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in sports is important, especially for girls.
It's an exciting moment.
Thank Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabrielle and Madison for the wonderful "girl power" in winning the Olympic Group gold medal, and for inspiring young girls with so many different backgrounds to open the path to health, strength, success.
After rejected Jeremy Hunt's offer, junior doctors plan to launch further strikes.
Ministers initially wanted to end this change-induced dispute by accepting a contract amended by the British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58 per cent of 37,000 junior doctors who voted against the contract.
In July, Mr. Hunt revealed that the plan was mandatory, saying that the British National Medical Services System (NHS) was currently in a "vacuum zone" and that a slight delay would undermine the interests of employees and patients.
The new contract first refers to changes to the working practices of junior doctors overnight and weekends to improve care for irregular working hours.
Last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Junior Doctors Committee, said in a statement: "The junior doctor still has serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially fear that it will exacerbate the current labour crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly. "
It's only eight weeks before the first doctors sign a new contract, and we need to make progress. We don't have much time.
BMA works to settle disputes through negotiation, but people are reluctant to participate, sometimes governments respond in silence.
Nevertheless, just last month we got Jeremy Hunt's promise that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, cancel enforcement and solve the concerns of junior doctors.
If he doesn't, the junior doctor has made it clear that they're ready to take further labour action.
The last strike took place at the end of April, resulting in nearly 13,000 regular operations and 100,000 appointments delayed, as nurses and consultations were covered by doctors on the line.
The ministers initially wanted to end this change-induced dispute by accepting the BMA modified contract.
BMA wants to get a better weekend salary for 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract.
NHS Employers CEO Daniel Mortimer called on junior doctors to stop playing any strike.
Mr. Mortimer said, "The effectiveness of labour operations will put pressure on the already dedicated team and service, leading to concerns, concerns and confusion among patients, nursing staff and their families. "
Over the past two months, we have been negotiating with the Junior Doctors Committee and have been actively responding to their concerns about the role of guardians and reports with the Ministry of Health and other departments.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics — deployment, training flexibility — other training costs, training costs, common awareness of the curriculum, further training leave and gender wage differences in the field of medical care, which indicate the importance of employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health for the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds a day of drugs can reduce the threat of heart attack.
Officials suggested that a drug of 2 pounds a day be extended to more patients and to extend their medication, and that thousands of heart disease patients would benefit from this drug.
Anticondensant for ticagrelor reduces the risk of re-emergence of heart disease patients.
This drug lasts 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Optimization (NICE) under the regulatory body of the British National Medical Services System (NHS) recommends that patients continue to take medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now, NHS regulatory agency NICE recommends that patients continue to take medication for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people have heart disease each year, one quarter of them continue to have a heart attack or a stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by fat matter to form spots in the artery wall.
If the spots are broken, it causes a blood embolism, and then it's blocking blood flow into the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the embolism moves, it goes into the blood flow, blocking the flow of blood into the brain, causing a stroke.
Patients who have experienced a heart attack are more risky.
The British company AstraZeneca was manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca, sold as a trade name, which can reduce the risk of disease by reducing the formation of a blood embolism.
The NICE draft, released today, recommended that patients take 90 mg for 12 months for 12 months, and 60 mg for Cage and two aspirins a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: " Despite effective secondary preventive treatment, as many as a quarter of patients with a history of heart attack will have serious consequences. "
Fear of re-emergence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that taking with aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of heart disease and strokes for patients who have experienced heart attacks.
We are deeply pleased that the temporary recommendation for Kagray will provide more treatment options for thousands of beneficiaries.
Since there is limited information on the efficacy and safety of the treatment and safety after three years, especially the risk of bleeding, the draft guidance does not recommend that its treatment continue after this period.
Computer culture has spread the Muslim region of electoral fraud.
The former mayor of Tower Hamletts, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed last year for corruption and prompted the publication of a government report.
The "political correctness" culture has blinded the widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, as this lethal government report revealed today.
Sir Eric Pickles, former Cabinet Minister, accused the police that the election regulators and the city hall were blind to evidence of abuse of elections because of "oversensitive to racial division and religious issues".
The former Minister of Community Affairs, who is now anti-corruption, has stated that the practice of threatening voters with religious positions has a bad impact and that the police should be allowed to set up a alert line outside the polling station to protect voters who are in a state of shock.
He suggested that voters vote with their IDs to confirm their identity.
For now, voters need to give their names and addresses.
This report even recommends that ink that cannot be wiped off on the voter finger to prevent a second vote.
Sir Eric said that protection of the reporting should be increased.
He called for increased media access to conference documents and decisions made by unofficial committees or working groups.
"It's not just to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect local governments from widespread culture of corruption and the poison of financial fraud closely linked to them," he said.
This report was released on Downing Street after the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that there was a series of corruption and violations in the current mayor, Rahman, and should be dismissed.
The court found that Rahman "very ridiculously abused" the religious feelings of the Muslim community and closed his allegations of racial discrimination and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have claimed that his vote was a religious duty of loyal Muslims in the campaign. "
As many as 300 votes have doubts, probably the voters faked others to vote.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of electoral fraud all over the country.
He warned in particular about mailing electoral fraud, which was said to put pressure on voters by senior members of the Muslim community to force them to vote for their designated candidates.
Sir Eric (in the photo) made a number of suggestions for the clean-up of voting mechanisms, including with identity documents to confirm his identity.
In his report, " Evidence suggests that senior members, particularly senior members in Pakistan and Bangladesh background communities, put pressure on vulnerable groups of ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote according to their wishes ... "
" Because of excessive sensitivity to racial division and religion, they fear that State institutions will ignore such acts ... "

Since his picture of Wolf of Wall Street was released on Twitter, American man archer Brady Allison has caused a huge riot in social media.
In fact, the archer noticed social media and admitted to being young, and someone said he looked like a plum.
"I don't think it looks like a gill, "Breddy said to Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome dude, so I think it's a compliment to me."
One of the most popular comparisons at the London Olympics in 2012 will undoubtedly find more similarities this year: the British jumper Greg Rutherford looks like Neil Patrick Harris.

The BBC Olympic lecturing apologizes for the comments of Chinese swimmers "slow as pigs."
Wednesday, Byron MacDonald, a 14-year-old, had provoked the fourth audience to watch the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Olympic live.
A Canadian BBC lobbyist said that 14-year-old Chinese swimming would be "swam faster than stinking" in the game, and finally "slow as a pig," and then the CBC was forced to apologize for it.
The interpreter Byron MacDonald made his own views at the end of the 4x200-metre free-swam relay final, when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
The audience heard Byron, a 14-year-old Chinese girl who was wearing a colored glasses commentator, said, "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake."
It was so exciting to start swimming faster than the stink, but then it was as slow as a pig.
Thanks to her.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, Avy, is the second best, using 1 minute 57 seconds to 79 -- Taylor Ruck of Canada, 1.61 seconds behind, and then narrowed the gap with China by Canada.
The entire Canadian audience was shocked by the tone and wording of the speaker, and then they reacted quickly on the Internet.
Emmett Macfarlane sent the saying, "The Cuban lecturing says that a 14-year-old swimmer in China is slow like a pig?"
This idiot didn't realize it was live.
The Chinese young general, who was at the 4x200-metre free swim relay final, was described as: "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter quickly came on Twitter, and many asked for his withdrawal.
When Twitter users heard Byron MacDonald was retarded, they didn't stop it.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "Wow, Byron MacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and your words and actions make us all sound like a bunch of racists.
Shortly after, the BBC radio host Scott Russell apologized on Byron's speech on the live broadcast, and he said, "We apologize for our comments on the performance of the swimmer."
"We're sorry about the inappropriate wording. "
CBC apologized to Twitter users who responded to the statement over 90 times.
Another interpreter, Scott Russell, apologizes on behalf of Byron.
The BBC then pasted their apology to over 90 other Twitter users who protested by Byron.
The channel soon apologized and issued a statement.
We're so sorry to say something like that and get it out of the air.
Last night, we took action quickly to apologize to the audience who watched us live and the audience watching us on social media.
It's important to explain that Byron's explanation is about swimming players, but not personally.
So, it's not the right language. Byron's sorry about that.
Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized for his words on the air, saying he didn't mean anything to attack and tried to get out of his own words.
"I want to take some time to apologize for what I made last night after the women's relay," he said on the BBC O'Run.
"I'm just commenting on the swimr's performance, not against the individual."
"Of course, I don't mean disrespectful, I'm sorry."
Primark, the customer was angry at a woman who tried her underwear in the center of the store.
A woman took off her underwear in the middle of a Primark shop, and the customers in the store don't know where to look.
Worse still, she looked at how she looked when she put it on and put her underwear off and put it back on the shelf.
She went through the shelf and finally tried four underwear in this store at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
The woman was trying to wear underwear in the Primark store at the Bouvery Place mall in Folkestone and put it back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson, who was in the store, said, after trying to wear underwear, the mysterious woman "Get dressed again and then walked out of the store and bought nothing."
She said, "Everyone can't believe what they see."
She stood in the middle of the store, took a pair of underwear off the shelf, took off her tights and underwear, and then she put it on.
"She didn't try to find a hidden place to try it on -- she was just standing there, and it was shameless."
"When she took her underwear off again, everyone was shocked. Apparently, she was not satisfied because she put her underwear back on the shelf."
And then she tried three more like it, and then she didn't like it, and then she went out of the store again.
"She doesn't seem to care about someone looking at her -- or she didn't think who would eventually buy the underwear she tried through."
Ms. Davidson (33 years old), who lives in Kent, said, "It's disgusting to think that someone else would buy through and never cleaned underwear."
This happened Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "When she left, the clerk obviously had to do the bottom of these underwear, and it's good to be so good."
"I hate to buy a new underwear home, but I find another woman who tried through and never cleaned it."
A spokesman for Primark said, "Primark already knows what happened at our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9th."
All the problematic goods are down.
How to use Maga to protect yourself in a gun attack.
The world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com might give you a little sense of safety.
We ask the master of Krav Maga Federation in New York, Rhon Mizrachi, to learn how to deal with the gun-held killers at close range.
Whether he comes from the front or the back near you, the video will teach you how to lose.
Mizrachi said if the shooter comes near you from behind, all you have to do is turn around so you can see the assailant and "clean the line."
Then, grab the gun with your forearm and shoulder and hit the assailant with your elbow.
Then he'll use his knee to his belly ditch, and when the assailant bends down because of pain, turns his gun in his hand, hit him in the face with a barrel and a backup gun team, and keep his weapon on him.
If the shooter approaches from front, you use similar techniques -- to keep your body out of the line, take the gun and turn the gun around so that the shooter can't fire.
Meanwhile, press the weight on the gun and hit the assailant's chest and reverse the gun from his tight hand, and then point the gun at him.
Sounds complicated?
Look at the video, see how Mizrachi did it.
But remember, if you're not Master Maga, the safest way to get out of the robbery is to pay the gold.
A gangster family destroyed a cheap rental house in Soltash, Cornwall County before being deported.
A hooligan family expelled from a gangster who was expelled from his neighbours had damaged his home-based rental before leaving, causing a loss of Pound50,000.
After a long series of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and his husband Shaun Trebilcock were expelled from a rental house in Soltash, Cornwall County.
After being forced to leave the residence, the housing association officials were surprised to find that the site was severely damaged.
There's holes all over the wall, the floor is broken, the garbage is thrown out, the walls are all over the place.
After being deported, the family has been moving and is said to be living in a private home.
Donna McEvoy, the house manager of the Cornwall County Housing Association, said she was worried that the house would no longer be saved.
She said, "For people who live here, it's a nightmare, and I don't think people can live like this."
There are a lot of things to weigh now, because this house is likely to be a bad element in Cornwall County.
The family is notorious, and their names are also notorious.
The couple had three sons who would live here from time to time, and the police said that the horrors of the family included fighting on the streets using baseball bats, threatening the residents, drugs, drug trafficking, yelling, arguing and cursed.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant, Skeldon, received an antisocial act resolution.
In this house that could be dismantled, many rooms were placed in garbage for a long time.
In this room where drugs were traded, the floor was lifted.
Neighbors say they often see them fighting on the streets, and they call the police for that.
After giving an extension of 11 weeks to make them move voluntarily, the Cornwall County Housing Association forced her from her husband this week.
Finally, the neighbors were cheering for it, and they said that life was hell on earth.
A neighbor said, "They don't care about anyone."
We've been living next door for 20 years, and we've been so bad.
We've seen the police come in a million times.
"This morning, we couldn't sleep."
We're up early because it's too quiet here -- we're not used to it!
They're finally gone. That's great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, community executive manager of the Cornwall County Housing Association, said that the family had not been able to cooperate with the local government.
The family lived in this house for 20 years, and the police visited him a lot.
Garbage and old toys are thrown on the side of the weeds.
He added, " Unfortunately, the tenant did not have any responsibility for her and her family's actions, and the expulsion was the last practice considered by the Cornwall County Housing Association. "
It's a very difficult case, because they're acting very extreme, and what they do must scare the neighbors.
I thank my team for his work and for the community members who bravely provided us with information.
I hope this will bring some comfort to the neighbors and send a message that we will not tolerate antisocial behaviour.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said their three sons lived in this house at different times, but also said they were in their 20s.
After they were driven away, one of the bedroom floors threw a dirty mattress.
Housing Association workers will soon clean up the garbage around the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house, found more than 70 grams of marijuana, and found scales, drug use and Pound1,700 in cash.
After plead guilty, Skeldon was fined for holding B-type drugs and drug trafficking.
She claims that money was used to buy gravestones for Lee Skeldon, son of a car accident in 2013.
It is understood that after being homeless, Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of the house are full of graffiti.
Police say they're going to expel tenants who disobey the tenants' rules.
Angela Crow of Devon County and Cornwall County Police said that the expulsion had issued a clear warning to other tenants who continued to disobey the rules of tenants.
"This warning is directed at those who think that their actions will not be blamed, and those who are destroyed by such acts," she said.
Devon County and Cornwall Police will not tolerate crime and antisocial behaviour, and they will continue to work together to protect our communities.
Reed: Hilary will nominate Garland for the Supreme Court if elected President
Harry Reid, Senate Democratic Leader, said he was convinced that if Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, she would nominated Judge Merrick Garland to enter the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have prevented confirmation of Garland since President Barack Obama nominated Garland in March.
Mitch McConnell, leader of the Senate majority, said that the next president would choose this man to replace the late Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia.
Reed said at a teleconference on Thursday that he predicted Hilary would choose "some credibility" Garland.
A woman spokesman for Reed then said that Reed would not have nominated Garland for direct dialogue with Hilary and said he was just guessing.
He appreciated Garland and said Hilary's team didn't want to "smuggle" because of the new guy.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the Federal Circuit Court of the District of Columbia.
Reed said that Republicans who stopped Garland from nominated were Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "pity" and "Accomplishor".
He said Trump wasn't fit to be president.

And we're looking at women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is the same.
"We need to show the eternal and classic nakedness that makes women and men feel comfortable, and that's what Shaw said at a calendar presentation.
Women will be happy to participate in this film because it's a beautiful art.
Models can submit photo offers online or go to public recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York.

The French courts rejected the petition for the demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camp.
A French court rejected the petition of the Galle government to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, which currently lives in thousands of refugees.
At the court hearing this week, the Galle Government argued that the French Government should have the right to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops in the camp. People sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks in refugee camps, provide hairdressing services, and also selling tea at a price of 50 cents (40 pence) in a temporary restaurant or at a price of several euros.
The Governor's Office of Galle believes that these places should be dismantled because they are not tax-paying parallel economies and still have fire and health hazards.
Humanitarian groups have indicated to the courts that these shops and restaurants are of great importance, as State-supported associations and other groups provide free food that cannot meet the growing refugee needs of the camp.
They say these temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
A Reel court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the operator of the 72 temporary shops, but stated that the Governor of Galle's concern was "a perfectly understandable".
Judge Jean Franz Molla said that the role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants was much more than simply providing food to refugees living under extremely dangerous conditions.
He said these places were peaceful points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the areas threatened by the demolition was the Jungle Book Kids Cafe in the camp, which provides 200 food, English and French classes per day and provides asylum advice for hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed petitions to protect this cafe.
A letter to Guardian wrote that closing the cafe would be a disaster for these children (many children are only eight years old).
Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, two charitable organizations, predict that the number of refugees in jungle camps has exceeded 9,000 on Friday, which is the highest level since the surge in the number of refugees in the summer.

"Environmental problems are in the atmosphere, water, soil pollution, but the roots are still in the production lifestyle."
For example, the land development in Jiangsu Province was 21 per cent in 2015, the highest in the autonomous regions of the country.
As a result, the problem of high pollution, large energy, multi-areas has not been fundamentally addressed from a shift from a productive lifestyle.
On the one hand, the creation of various ecological environments at all levels in Jiangsu province is the highest in absolute advantage; on the other hand, the resource environment is under high pressure.
A solid promotion of ecological environmental protection and governance requires a fundamental shift in productive lifestyles and building eco-civilization for people ' s lives.

Qingdao is the twelfth and first pilot city in Shandong Province to use and trade in reimbursable use and trading.
On 11th, several companies came to the Qingdao City Sewer Trade Centre to submit claims for sewage rights, and the requisition will be paid for use.
The first list of transactions that is about to be completed also a sign of the official opening of the pilot project on the Qingdao sewage rights trade, which will also be the first list of the provincial sewage rights trade and the national urban-level trading list.
On the morning of 11th, Zhao Su-ping, General Manager of the Qingdao Precision Chemical Company Ltd., came to the Qingdao City Sewer Trade Center to submit a requisition for sewage rights.

The project belongs to a mechanical processing enterprise with the initial right to discharge as a chemical oxygen requirement (COD) 0.514 tonnes/year, nitrogen (NOX) 0.052 tonnes/year.
The right to discharge of atmospheric pollutants is a priority industrial enterprise for the supply of electricity throughout the city.
Existing sewage units that have received an environmental assessment by 1 January 2016 are not charged for reimbursable use.
" Reimbursable access to sewage does not equal access to illegal sewage and does not release pollutants at will ... "
The Deputy Director of the Qingdao City Environmental Protection Agency, Han Hongyan, described that the excess sewage would still be punished in accordance with the relevant regulations and could not allow illegal enterprises to circumvent them by buying sewage rights.
That is, by legal means, to combat environmental violations and severely punish enterprises for over-standard sewage, thereby protecting the environment and ensuring public health.
Now companies have increased their motivation for their own benefit, valued limited sewage rights and reduced pollutants emissions.
With economic benefits driven, reducing emissions from government forced behaviour to corporate conscious market behaviour, thus truly achieving environmental protection, nature, and public health.
The right to discharge, also known as the right to emissions of pollutants, refers to the right of the person to release pollutants to the environment within the Government ' s assigned amount.
This right is essentially the right of sewage to have access, use and benefits to environmental capacity resources.
Next, with the total amount of pollutants emissions not exceeding permitted emissions, the internal sources of pollution are transferred through currency exchange.

If the transfer department is determined to "war" on driving mobile phones, it will be a normal measure, and this violation will be contained.

Miss Zhang Binbin: "Beautiful Hand" started shooting a few times in her career.
Zhang Donghong, East Park Village, Xiamen Shang An, just changed his home 29-inch old TV to 65 inches of television.
The daughter of this ordinary farmer, Zhang Binbin, who won the 50-metre rifle of the Rio Olympic woman on the night of 11th.
On the night of 11th, just before this new TV, the Zhang Donghongs and dozens of relatives and friends witnessed the daughter's marching straight after, from almost pre-election to the amazing process that almost reversed.
In the game of the day, Zhang Binbin ranked down, and seemed to be far from the finals.
But parents and family and friends didn't give up, and they kept writing the text, and saw Zhang Binbin raised his name and finally locked the final seat, and his home was cheering from a moment.
In the finals, Zhang Binbin was once behind the ranking, the more steady the last few shots were played, and only won the silver medal with the 0.2 ring behind the champion.
Zhang Binbin, 27 years old, actually, in 16 years of shooting, almost passed with this hard silver card.
His mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told the reporters that Zhang Binbin had found a few novelists in the village when they hesitated.
These novelists were recommended to attend the same village kids who were also recommended for training, and Zhang Binbin's cousin.
Soon after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once returned to Shang An's school for reasons of family difficulties.
But after his Enlightenment Coach Zhang Yajie repeatedly did his job, Zhang Binbin returned to the Xiamen team.
After entering the provincial team, Zhang Binbin returned home again because he couldn't get in the country because he couldn't see hope.
This time, not only did Coach Zhang Yaji, the leader and coach of the Xiamen Shoot Arrow Sports Center and Fujian province come home, but finally advised Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team.
Like yesterday's game, this girl's insistence has turned a reverse on the path of shooting.
"Every coach picks the team differently, when I saw Binbin's hand look beautiful, and it was just in one way."
Zhang Dong-hong also recalled that in the training test, the daughter, although not the best, had a stable number of rings, which was also an important reason for Zhang Binbin to attract coaches.
In training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yaji was most impressed by the investment of this farmer girl.
He recalled that Zhang Binbin entered the Xiamen shooting team more than a year later, and that the team was trained to shoot for more than a year, demanding that the team not move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told the reporters that her daughter was a quiet, good boy, and since she was a kid, he liked to paint and make his own hand-made toys.
"I'll make clothes at home, sewn up, and Binbin will pick up some of the horns and make dolls themselves."
She said that her daughter used to sew her own hand-to-hand toys, and she was good at painting, from the five officers of the doll to the dress, and she could always do it.
As athletes, Zhang Binbin and his family are less than we can go home on holidays, and they can be contacted by telephones.
Parents say that Zhang Binbin rarely talks about his hard work, and more about having fun with his parents.
I don't usually see my daughter, my parents keep their daughters' paintings and their honors at home.
Zhang Xiaolong showed his daughter's comic book to the press, "If she hadn't been a shooter, she would continue to paint."
And in the second floor of Zhang Binbin's living room, there's a locker full of medals, medals and certificates she won.
Zhang Dong-hong put the medals and medals together, and the certificate was kept in the folder, "These are the honors that Binbin has changed for over a decade, and we value it."
Recently, the Hebei Province Tzu Hyo Foundation sent $16,000 in condolences to six families in the village of Ii Yi County, Tai, Guiquan and others.
This is another condolence to society after the Fund's search for children and children who lost their children and lonely elderly in the floods of 7.19.
7.19 Heavy rainfall caused multiple disasters in Hebei Province, causing floods and deaths and disappearances in parts of the province.
Good man Iron, who died in helping the district's duty to drain, left two-year-olds and six-year-old wives, and the touching story of the good man "old iron" touched the city.
On August 4, Hebei Province's Tzu Hyo Foundation staff and Hebei brand volunteers came to the good man Iron's home to hand over $3,200 to the family of Iron.
When the Vice President of the Brand Club, Yelly learned about the status of the Old Iron family, it was decided to run a "love sale" campaign in the brand club to help the Iron family get into trouble.
Hebei Province Tzu Hyo Foundation, known as the Hebei Volunteer Foundation, was launched by the Hebei Brands Preparatory Committee and established in August 2015.
According to the Hong Kong Daily East Daily, on August 12, there are currently three major problems in the sale of diamonds in the interior, including the netness of false diamonds, the weight of the diamonds, the unsafe after sale.
Antwerp, one of the largest diamond trading centres in the world, is known as the diamond cutting techniques of local craftsmen, and the diamonds sold were strictly identified and welcomed by the Mainland ladies.
"A small bag, a small group of light-floating, worth nearly a million dollars," a mother Liu, who was involved in the purchase of diamonds, described to the interior media her experience in Antwerp this June.
She means she hid the diamonds in her underwear, went to the bathroom for days in a row, taking a bath, and she was nervous walking and sleeping.
She called the diamonds purchased in Antwerp at about $55,000 per carat, and the retail price of the same quality diamonds at the gate is about $11,000.
She sold all the diamonds for the purchase, making $200,000 at a time.
According to the Customs of the Mainland, diamonds are not goods or essentials in the journey, so they are in the category of goods and are subject to declaration at the time of entry and exit, otherwise they may be listed as smuggling, which may be severely sentenced to prison.
According to foreign media reports, on 10th local time, the British Prime Minister's Office Downing Street announced that British Prime Minister Teresa May would spend the summer vacation in Switzerland, but did not reveal the specific place of leave.
According to the media, after the British referendum, the new British Prime Minister chose to go to the "neutral country" Switzerland on the continent, with some kind of policy symbolicity.
The British Guardian commented that the symbolicity represented by Switzerland, a neutral country, played a role in the choice of the first British Prime Minister's resort.
The British Daily Telegraph commented that Teresa May chose to go to Switzerland for a vacation, the first time since Mrs. Thatcher had been on vacation in Switzerland.
The choice of the two female prime ministers and the two male prime ministers Blair and Cameron liked to go to hotter places to create a contrast.
According to the information received, the new British Prime Minister Teresa May will return to London on August 24th, and then waiting for her is a series of important jobs and activities.
The British Parliament will resume its meeting on September 5, on the subject of debate, including the second de-European referendum requested online.
On June 23rd, the British referendum decided to de-European, but the new British Prime Minister was reluctant to launch section 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on De-European States by the end of the year.
The existing intangible cultural heritage projects in Huangshan City are 1325, with the first type and quantity in the province.
Because of the non-genative heritage of the emblem culture, many non-relicts are essential to preserve and protect using digital technology.
According to the main organization of the work of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People ' s Congress this year, the Standing Committee plans to hear a special report on its work and conduct a thematic consultation on the implementation of banking supervision and management laws to serve local economic development.
In mid-August, the Standing Committee will organize two research teams to some municipalities to prepare thematic queries.
Hana Jian Hui noted that the Standing Committee of the Provincial People ' s Congress heard and considered a special report on the work of vertical management and conduct thematic queries, which was the first time in my province, and was an active exploration for strengthening and expanding the oversight of the people.
In Xinjiang Kash's exercise director's department, with the voice of the director-in-chief, the military police units in Kash, Wada, Aksu, quickly followed the instructions of the guidance, to carry out mobile assembly to the field of exercise.
China's Mars Project is here.
Our Mars exploration mission is to be surrounded, landing, patrol, never abroad.
Our Mars detection launch target is to move around, land, patrol, and this mission is quite difficult.
Because Mars detection takes 26 months to meet a time window, experts are working closely to launch our first Mars detector in 2020.
According to Xu Da-chul, while our aircraft have entered deep space, the Mars detection mission remains indispensable, and the detection of Mars means that China is really entering the era of deep space detection.
" Every two or three years, Mars is the closest opportunity to launch Mars detectors at this point, which is the most energy-efficient for launch vehicles ... "
" Taking into account the quality of the Mars probe, our Long March Five launch vehicle will be completed by our launch mission ... "
Our Mars detection mission is to be surrounded, landing, patrol, a form that has never been abroad and has been proposed to achieve a round and landing abroad, but landing failed.
Mars detection involves a lot of technical areas, particularly, although the Mars vehicle is a space detector, it has a distinct feature compared to the general space detector.
That is, the Mars probe needs to have the ability to determine the route and detect the danger of the barrier.
Pang Shiho, a researcher at the Chinese Space Technology Group, said that humans were so fond of Mars exploration because the detection of Mars was of great scientific, technological, etc., and even about the future of mankind.
Mars has now become the highest human research planet except the Earth, and humans have used space detectors to detect Mars almost throughout the history of human space.
So humans want to build a residential base on Mars one day, eventually emigrate to Mars and turn it into a second home of mankind.
There are many signs that Mars was likely to have been like the current Earth, only after billions of years of evolution became a thin atmosphere, low temperature, water depletion, etc.
Therefore, detection or manned landing on Mars can predict the second Mars that prevent the Earth from becoming a difficult human being.
As of June 2016, 114 moon detections were conducted globally, 43 Mars detections.
However, since the 1990s, humans have conducted 18 Mars detections, while the Moon has only conducted 14 tests.
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars Rovers working, but only one Moon Orbital and 1 Moon Lander are working.
The world's largest space countries have developed a detection program targeting Mars systems, which shows that today's Mars detection is hotter than the moon's detection.
On November 5, 2013, India launched its first Mars detector, Mangarian, the first country in Asia to successfully detect Mars.
Mangarian is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars, to find out if there are methane and signs of life on Mars.
The hardest part of this mission is that the probe has only one chance to slow down the aerodynamic shape and parachutes after Mars atmosphere.
According to Sun Zechu, the general designer of the Mars probe at the 5th College of Space Technology Group, the Mars exploration mission faces many technical challenges.
Mars atmosphere pressure is low, only 1% of atmospheric pressure on the Earth's surface, with high uncertainty.
Scientists have not yet understood anything about its changes and the characteristics of the storm.
Mars often forms duststorms like the Earth's dust weather in summer, which will lead to a sharp decline in solar light energy received by the Mars vehicle, and must design a hibernation model for the Mars car to make it patiently waiting for the dust to pass.
Meanwhile, the Mars atmosphere has a reduction in solar light, which poses a challenge to the energy supply detected by Mars.
This requires a larger solar wing of the probe and needs to be adjusted to try to point the sun in the direction of the sun.
And, in addition, Mars surface gravity is only 38% of the Earth, but more gravity than the surface of the moon, so the probe needs greater power.
"The most difficult place for this Mars detection mission is the process of the probe entering the post-air-gas shape and parachute slowdown in Mars, with only one chance and must ensure success ... "
Sun Zezhou said that because the Earth is far away from Mars, the whole process cannot be controlled in real time by the ground, so it must be done by detectors.
Because there are not so many thrusters to offset the speed of the speed, the slowdown depends on the Mars atmosphere when landing on Mars, but the Mars atmosphere is difficult to simulate on the ground.
Pang Ho said that, in general, the way Mars is detected in a similar way to the moon, it's also "round, down, patrol, back," and eventually achieves the goal of human landing on Mars.
Because Mars is much further from Earth than the moon, detection of Mars needs to attack a series of more complex technologies.
According to Taiwan media reports, the "Administrative Director" Lin announced yesterday morning that the Political Parties and its accompanying organizations had been in force for property processing regulations since today.
The Vice President of the National Party, Jian Kai-hyun, said, "A national party of over a hundred years of history, with social commitment and responsibility, will not be so closed."
Lin has stressed that if political parties, accompanying organizations or trustees, etc. violate the prohibition of punishment under the regulations, the Commission will investigate in accordance with its mandate and be punished by law.
Lin also announced that he would be elected as Deputy Chairman of the Party Production Committee and would be the Deputy Director of the Department of Integrity, Hong Bacon.
He said that the main committee of the party production committee by Gu Li Hung would be the basis for the Committee ' s identification of relevant cases by using the experience of the Hong Bacon in the past to examine major cases.
Jian Kai-hyun believes that no one will give you a social donation today, and that if the party is confiscated, the National Party will be able to ask for social support and sponsorship, "Today really has no chance to ask for it."
Jian Kai-hyun also stressed that even after the bad party regulations went on the road, the National Party had not been fully confiscated and confiscated, the rest would be donated as promised to make the party zero, and the party had to start from scratch.
Original title: "Doctor of Corridor" Lanhwan v. Zhi An, the host of the court of honor, lost the first trial.
The legal evening newspaper, Wang Chi-Ann, made a statement in Sina Weibo about the corridor doctor's incident, and Lanhong Feng has brought Wang Chi-Ann and Beijing Wei Dream Creative Network Technology Ltd. to the court.
Yesterday afternoon, the Haidian Court sentenced the case, which found that Wang Zhi An and Wei-Mong did not constitute a violation and rejected all requests for action from Lantung Feng.
In early 2014, the journalist Wang Zhi An investigation found that despite the fact that the media had been sitting in the hospital corridor for over 600 days as a sad hero of institutional pressure, there was a lot of false information about these reports.
On March 29, 2014, the corridor doctor's show was broadcast by the news survey.
The so-called overmedical information reported to the media by Lanhu Feng has no evidence to support it.
Wang Chi-Ann also described in the real-named microblogging that "the point of Lanheng is a character, with a clear paranoid personality, etc.."
Lango Feng asked Wang Zhi An to delete the tweet, apologized to him and to compensate him for mental damage to $100,000.
At the time of the trial, the parties argued whether Wang Zhi An violated the reputation of Lanhwan.
12: The Chinese team is busy with the four bikes to break through.
The bike is expected to achieve the Olympic gold medal "zero breakthrough", and the female foot girl will challenge the German team twice and expect to blow into the four.
Wang Jin has been in a state of excellence in nearly two seasons, and last year the Beijing World Championship has been awarded silver medals, and in May this year the group won the World Championship.
According to foreign media reports, 27-year-old Korean archer Zhang Hui-jin won gold medals in the female archery personal race, and then the Olympic gold medal after the group, became the double crown king.
Zhang Hui-jin was considered a late-time player, and she regretted not getting tickets to the London Olympics, but now she is proud to be on the highest stage of the Rio Olympics.
Zhang Huijin beat Lisa Onlu, Germany, in the final finals of the women's arrows at the Rio Samba Avenue Stadium in Brazil, with a total score of 6-2.
She didn't shoot arrows for the first time in fourth grade, and she didn't get the first personal gold medal in 2014 at the World Cup, a late player.
Zhang Hui-jin recalled, "There was no level before high school that could not be able to compete in the national competition.
Zhang Hui-jin won only fourth place in the London Olympic competition four years ago, and lost tickets to the Olympics, and only two gold medals for his colleagues and friends, Chift.
Zhang Hui-jin spoke of her gold after the Women's Arrow Personal Award ceremony, "until the end is as much as possible, and it may have brought good results and satisfaction.
28-year-old Korean Arrow One Sister, and the winner of the London Olympics personal gold medal, Chiftbe, won the copper medal.
Chivbe lost to Zhang Huijin in the semi-finals and fought with Mexican player Alexandra Valencia.
Chivbe's crying field after ensuring the copper medal, and the gold burden is known.
First, the team has gained extensive experience in continuous research, followed by scientific training methods, which require long-term accumulation.
The Arrows are trained by military training, night crossing through graves, etc. to help the team concentrate and keep their normal hearts.
Although not yet confirmed, many sources have indicated that Apple's fall 2016 launch will be held in September, and iPhone7 is coming.
Although Apple did not respond, the configuration of the new iPhone has been released, even the iPhone7 "real machine model" picture on the Internet.
The new generation of iPhone is called "the crowd of eyes", hot, tight, rich and rich... if you want to buy it first, you have to choose a good channel, for example, Sunin.
This exacerbates disappointment with the new phone, "It's longer, but it can't project hologram images! This generation of iPhone is terrible."
The iPhone7 was like any other iPhone, with countless secrets before birth.
In addition, there are several sources that the new generation of iPhone will cancel 3.5 mm earphone interfaces and switch to bluetooth connections and charge interfaces, which will provide space for apples to add a second speaker.
Another evidence of this information is that apples were allowed to produce earphone products connected through the charging interface as early as 2014.
These messages are either real or false, and the answer will not be revealed until the Apples release in autumn 2016.
But that doesn't prevent industry from looking at the iPhone7 prospects -- many people think that iPhone7 will probably be the last major upgrade of apples to the iPhone series.
Although data published by the recent market research institute IDC, the iPhone market share has declined.
Of these, Goldman Sachs maintained the "buy-in" rating of apples, while BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will reap a historic sales achievement.
And the CEO Hock Tan of Chase also said that the future revenue of apples would be likely to increase by more than 20%, which was entirely due to the launch of iPhone7.
Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to buy iPhone7, compared to 4% of the number of people planning to buy iPhone6 two years ago.
It is understood that 20% of the user group currently holding iPhone6 or 6Plus is planning to buy iPhone7, a considerable proportion.
Second, there's an expert analysis that most of the powder likes to replace their iPhone phones.
According to statistics, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones in two years, i.e. the iPhone of almost 120 million users has been in use for two years.
According to the media, Taiwan suffered several earthquakes during the iPhone7 production period, "the level of damage to power production facilities is beyond imagination and may have an impact on the initial iPhone7 supply. "
The supply and demand conflict affects ordinary users, and it is time to choose a good channel, and it's time to start with the iPhone7.
According to sources, recently, the Sunning High-level met with Apple to prepare sufficient sources.
The operator has already agreed with Suning, and it is predictable that as the parties work in depth, they will certainly bring lower prices and more caring services to users.
"The lowest price, consumers may buy iPhone7'. "
Adequate supply and a variety of concessions to make the purchase of iPhone7 no longer "pressure mountain", and Sunin's logistics will turn this beauty into a more visual experience.
Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night, "Hello, Suning Yee, your iPhone7 is here."
The sponsors want to make local people more aware of the ancient Chinese culture through the exhibition of cultural objects, thereby enhancing mutual understanding and friendship among the peoples of the two countries.
Barcelona's Ming Dynasty Exhibition is part of the European tour, which will last until early October.
The Bank of Wahsha, the Bank of Puffa released the 2016 semi-annual report yesterday, and the mid-term certificate was re-enacted in the second quarter.
Of these, China-Certificate has increased its share of 2929.31 million shares at the Bank of Wahsha, and by the end of June, the number of Chinese cash holding shares increased to 387 million shares, representing a share of 335% to 3.62 per cent.
It was also measured by the solicitation of securities, with the increase in the number of shares held by the Bank of Pufa in the second quarter, increasing its share to nearly 600 million shares, or 2.77% of the shares of the Bank of Pufa.
Recently, the Hobo Park of the Lion of Jung Fook Village, Zhejiang Province, is officially open to villagers and tourists.

The rural flower industry, which is both visible, leisure and economic efficiency, has become a highlight of new rural development in the country.
According to external media reports, the Rio Olympic Green Pool incident has recently received attention from blue to green from the pool.
However, in the morning of the 10th, the waterball pool, which was adjacent to the dive pool, turned green.
After the Australian waterball game, he said his eyes were stinging and crying.
Previously, Rio Olympic officials confirmed the greening of the pool and stated that the coloring of the pool was due to the weak alkalineness and did not affect the health of athletes.
But after winning the game with Japanese representatives in the pool, Australian athletes said that their eyes were stinging.
The first time after the pool got greened, the host of the competition worked overtime on the night of 9th, but the color of the pool changed rapidly in the morning of 10th.
During the Australian team and the Japanese team, the environmental conditions of the pool deteriorated, but officially stressed that they would restore the water quality of the two pools to the original colour on 11th.
Mario Andrada, the spokesman for the Rio Olympic Games, said, " Yesterday afternoon, the water-alkali level in the pool first got weaker."
"We have learned a series of reasons why the water may cause the color change of pool water and the alkalineity of water quality. "
The Water Sports Centre conducted a series of tests on water quality, with hundreds of divers and swimmers using swimming pools to determine water quality conditions to meet standards ... "
"We have been following normal procedures these days, but we may ignore the more athletes may have an impact on water quality. "
"But changes in water colours must have no impact on physical health, especially for athletes. "
"This independent team confirmed our assessment and confirmed the measures taken to restore the pool to normal colour and normal chemical state. "
"We wanted the pool to return to normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected by rain. "
According to Taiwan Central, an explosion occurred yesterday in a prison on the outskirts of Manila, wounding the warden and 10 prisoners died, reportedly including two Chinese.

Urumqi regulates the business order travel agency of the tourist market must sign contracts with tourists
Xinjiang has now entered the tourist season to regulate the business order of the tourist bulk market, and the Urumqi Tourism Law Enforcement Unit, the Urumqi City Tourism Enforcement Unit, which was not regulated yesterday, was investigated by travel agencies and tourists.
Yesterday morning, about 10 buses full of tourists were parked around the Kebinski Hotel, mostly a day-long tour of the Skypool.
"Hello, I'm from the Urumqi City Tourist Board. You signed a contract with this travel agency?"
Yu Bin, staff member of the Urumqi City Transport Authority, described: " The alien tourist vehicle and the bus run a tourist passenger project in the Urumqi market, which is not qualified to practice ... "
"Extra-range operation fine for this fine of 30,000 to 100,000, and the driver does not have a qualification of $2,000. "
It was understood that the tourism law enforcement authorities in Urumqi had previously examined the concentration of tourist dispers such as West Park, Red Mountain.
In combination of two inspections, Deputy Chief of the Urumqi Tourism Law Enforcement Unit, Maggie, said, "First is safe, second is regulation, travel vehicles are small, and if the problem is, the problem is dead. "
"We and the pipeline jointly conduct continuous market inspections to regulate travel agencies ' car behaviour to ensure the safety of tourists ... "
On the morning of 12 August, the State Council Press Office held a press conference on the functioning of the national economy in July 2016.
According to the Director of the National Bureau of Statistics, the Director of the National Economic Integrated Statistics Division, said that in July, some national economic indicators slowed, but still operating in reasonable zones.
Data released by the National Statistical Office show that data on fixed assets investment in July have fallen back.
The Chinese government has said that with regard to the July national economy, I would like to use the phrase "like fluctuations and still good" that the Prime Minister had said, which would better summarize the characteristics of the economic operation of July.
He explained that "shaped fluctuations" means that some economic indicators in July are actually falling back.
Export pressure is still high because the domestic and foreign economies are still in deep adjustment in July, the international situation is complex and the recovery of the world economy is not as expected.
In the domestic context, the economy is at a critical stage of adjustment, and the adjustment pain is released and the economy is under considerable pressure, so some indicators are volatile.
The campaign noted that there was a special situation in July, where floods were more severe, and that the heat and heat weather had had some impact on production operations in some regions.
According to the recent release of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people in the country were affected, with direct economic losses exceeding $200 billion.
In terms of industry, investment, transport-related indicators, these areas are affected to different degrees.
In July, the turnover of goods increased at a rate of 3.6 percentage points last month, and floods had a certain impact on traffic in these areas.
From these factors, the volatility of some indicators in July is also normal and expected.
He said that "the momentum is still good" means that, despite the economic growth rate, the economy is generally stable, steady, and the steady trend is still unchanged.
In July, the CPI rose by 1.8 per cent, the ring ratio increased by 0.2 per cent; the CPI rose by 2.1 per cent in January-July, so the price situation was generally stable.
According to the Chongqing City Meteorological Service portal, high temperature benefits are available in the rest of our city, except for the Sunyang.
At least 28 provinces in the country have identified the standard for the payment of allowances, although the criteria are not the same in the provinces and municipalities, while Chongqing receives high temperature benefits according to the high temperature working day allowance.
For less than 35 degrees C or more, it is issued at no less than $10 per person per day; and not less than $15 per person per day.
A maximum of 20 yuan per day per month for high-temperature staff or more (except for workers who have received a high temperature job allowance in accordance with the law).
According to this standard, the largest number of high-temperature weather days in the last month was $330, with the lowest number of days at 80 dollars, while the highest temperature in Zhongyang was not met, so there was no high temperature allowance.
Many units have previously been able to hit the high temperature allowance with cold drinks, and the City Security Board has indicated that this is not in line with the current approach.
If the working hours are suspended due to high temperatures, the employer shall not be deducted or reduced by the worker ' s wages.
According to the City Social Council, if employees are exposed to high temperatures without receiving high temperature benefits, they can seek legal rights and interests through the labour dispute mediation agency in which the enterprise is located or by calling 12333 complaints.
If useful units refuse to pay high temperature benefits, workers may complain to human resources social security authorities at the district level and above where the worker is located.
At the same time, because the high temperature allowance is part of the wage, not the benefit, the total wage is included and the tax is reduced.
Therefore, the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage and must be paid in cash and cannot be replaced in kind, such as beverages.
The newly built Urumqi station is located in the high iron area of Urumqi City, with a total building area of about 100,000 square metres.
The first floor of the ground is the entrance, the waiting room and the office, the commercial room, the first floor of the ground is the exit floor.
At present, Urumqi Station is the largest integrated transport hub in Xinjiang, which combines high iron, orbital traffic, public transport, rental, etc., to achieve seamless docking in various ways.
There are three ticket offices on both sides of the station and north of the north side of the station, with 39 manual ticketing windows and 34 automatic ticket pickers.
In terms of ticket checks, there are 30 channels on both sides of the waiting lobby, and passengers can conduct quick checks, waiting for vehicles according to the ticket number.
If you need help, you can choose 41 call buttons set within the station, and you can get timely services.
From July 1, the old passenger station, the passenger train at Urumqinan Station, walked to Urumqi Station.
That means all cars and 30-to-country trains can park at Urumqi station.
Now both stations can buy tickets by car, and the train between them is about 10 minutes, and passengers need to pay attention to the exact name of the ticket and terminal.
The official operation of the new Urumqi passenger station will be an important platform for building a national integrated transport city in Xinjiang, promoting the Silk Road Economic Belt and the construction of a new zone.
Gracia is a cute female-mouthed bird with a smell of tropical rainforests.
In Costa Rica, the giant mouth bird Gracia and its stories are well known.
At the press conference on August 10th, Gracia, who recovered after the surgery, finally showed people its brand-new 3D print plastic bird.
This giant bird, who was broken a year and a half ago, was finally reborn.
This day not only announced that it was 100% healthy, but also the day it moved into the luxury birdhouse and met with human friends who cared about it.
Gracia, who first entered the new house, became a little bit more lively, playing in the water basin, eating grapes with new tarts.
To remind people that it had suffered, technicians did not color it, but kept the original white of 3D print materials.
The bird's twilight is a thin horny stairwell, which is empty, and only some fine bone support poles are interlocked.
Although with this internal reinforcement, the twilight of the giant mouth bird is fragile and broken when hurt.
Animal rescue centres, bird scientists and a 3D printing company in the United States, have worked together to make several "test twilights" for Gracia, and finally made the perfect twilight that was best suited to it.
Now Gracia is good at drinking water, eating, even pecking small grains.
"The final product was designed for about two months, and it took four or five hours to print it out. "
"3D printing is not future technology, it's really coming into your life. "Thomas Lange, Chairman of SG3D Printing, USA, said in an interview with Xinhua International Reporter.
In January 2015, a farm in Gracia, in central Costa Rica, a blood-sniffed giant, was discovered.
It was brutally broken by a group of young people, and it was completely uneating, life was in danger.
After the tragic media coverage of Gracia, there was a wave of anti-abuse of animal abuse in Costa Rica.
People are demanding stricter animal protection laws to increase penalties for abusers.
People come here on their own, doing their best to help Gracia recover his life before she gets hurt as much as possible.
Even Chuck Hull, an inventor of 3D printing technology, was involved in the design of Gracia's top.
"The situation in Gracia is special, and its upper part is less than 1 centimetres, so it poses many difficulties for the installation of the new twilight. "
"We scan Gracia first, then design, produce an extended prosthetic that is slightly longer than the rest of it, and we'll stick it on it with glue. "
"This will reduce further intrusive harm to Gracia... " Lange said to Xinhua International Journalists.
Before the prosthetics are installed, staff clean up the tatters for Gracia every day to prevent infection.
A thousand miles away, the story of the giant mouth bird Gracia touched the famous documentary director Paula Eredia and the exploration channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded the drops of Gracia's installation of the new twilight, recording a documentary, "The Country of Big Mouth Birds", which was broadcast on the Animal Planet Channel this month.
The documentary "The Country of the Big Mouth" shows people how a little giant mouthbird changes a country and how to involve people in the fight against animal abuse.
Core tip: Japanese oil companies are particularly vigilant about the rise of small independent refineries known as the "coffee pot".
The news network reported on August 12th that Japan's largest oil company, JX energy, believes that "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the depression.
Japanese oil companies are particularly vigilant about the rise of small independent Chinese refineries called "coffee pots".
China's oil quality is gradually approaching Japanese oil because the Chinese government has strengthened environmental regulations.
Before obtaining a licence to import crude oil, the Teapot Refinery usually imported heavy oil with high sulphur content from Russia and others.
The high sulphur content of the oil produced and poor oil products became one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining a licence to import crude oil, the Teapot Refinery was able to import Oman's crude oil and Russian-producing crude oil, and the quality of its petroleum products has also improved.
East Flaming General Oil Company said, "As the quality standards of petroleum products in China continue to improve, the capacity of refining equipment has also increased.
As a result, China's foreign exports of petroleum products are gradually at the same level as Japan."
JX energy says, "after the end of 2015, China began exporting high-quality light oil to Australia", competing with Japanese products in the Asian market.
Although Japanese oil is facing a crisis, the Japanese oil company's response is only "exporting to profitable areas while focusing on markets".
Because of the enormous impact of Chinese-exported petroleum products on Asian markets, attention to teapot refineries is also increasing.

An Indian uncle just landed at Dubai International Airport last week, and this week he won a $1 million prize in the same airport.
The Indian Mohamed Bashir Abdul Hadal, a long-standing Dubai, has a habit of buying lottery tickets every time he returns.
His 21-year-old son was paralysed by an accident crash, and he worked hard to repay his son's medical loan.
"The escape from the crash was God who gave me a second life and gave me the money to do good," Hadal said.
It's a fall, but Autumn Tiger seems to be a little bit worse than summer.
How can the skin be smoother not only makes the skin blacker, but it's more tanned, how can it be successfully passed through military training, not to get sunburned?
The sunscreen packaging is usually marked with SPF and PA, SPF means sunscreen index, for UVB ultraviolet light, and our common SPF index is 15, 30, 50, etc.
The product marked with PA is directed at UVA, so that sunscreen can play a more effective role, and normally the strength of PA is expressed in +, and one plus means an extension of effective protection.
Oily skin should choose a more permeable water sunscreen, and sunscreen spray is a good option.
Dry skin should select sunscreens in frost; neutral skin is generally not strictly regulated, and sensitive skin is a burden, and it is recommended that pure physical sunscreen products be selected.
Remember to put sunscreen half an hour in advance, because it takes time to fully infiltrate the skin.
The military training is longer, and sunscreens can last every two hours. Don't be lazy.
Because the skin is just getting sunburned, the military training comes back and doesn't use white products immediately.
After military training, if you have a towel, you can use ice to get burned skin to slow down the local heat.
Farmers who purchase agricultural machinery during the fair continue to apply a cumulative subsidy policy, and farmers can receive up to 40 per cent subsidy for agricultural machinery.
The show was for global business fairs, especially to increase invitations to countries along the "Away" and target market countries.
The fair seeks to complete 60 projects for the offer, introducing $22 billion, and has entered into more than 160 trade contracts, with a contract of $3.2 billion.
According to the information received, the "Shot Fair" has been in the bottom of the market for seven years in a row, and is a long-standing industrial development in the city of Ludei, Hunan Province.
As host of the Fair, Ludi has established trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world.
The Fair became an important platform for local development of the specialty industry and promoting the exit of the country.
On some nights, the ionosphere is full of free electronics, which means that radio signals can go further.
According to the U.S. Mass Science monthly website, August 11, the U.S. Air Force is interested in copying this effect.
Although the ionosphere with a stable number of free electronics can help people listen to the radio station on the edge of the broadcast range of a university radio station, this may not be the interest of the U.S. Air Force.
Electronic ionosphere means that the radio used by the military has a greater range of transmission and it may provide some protection for GPS signals from solar storms.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of cube satellites based on demand that can strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
But first, these teams that contract with the Air Force must prove that the scientific principles will work.
Industry data show that coal capacity is close to 6 billion tons in 2015, and 1.8 billion tons of coal production in the country.
In the last decade, the State Department has issued five notifications of phase-out surplus and backward capacity.
Although the first four times were not targeted in the coal industry, the target industry had a direct relationship with the coal industry.
Last November and January this year, the price of 5500 large card-powered coals on Qin Emperor Island wandered at a low level of 370 yuan/tonne, and 90% of coal companies were lost.
Since February, coal prices have risen gradually, and the price of power coal in Qin Emperor has recently risen four weeks, rising to 16 months, climbing to $436 per ton, nearly $70 from the beginning of the year.
As prices rise, the world fears that it will produce: will a group of small coal mines return to their production?
In response, the Director of the Economic Institute for Reform and Development of China (Hainnam) has analysed and interpreted it.
Quan Hyun Ming: The ability to produce has attracted high attention, and the report card for the coal industry released today is a source of concern.
These three surface factors reflect the relative delay in our growth patterns in the past, the government-led growth approach that has not yet been fundamentally transformed.
Secondly, this is also directly related to the advancement of local governments, and in the process of de-capacity, the financial and corresponding measures are in place, and in this regard, the differences between different regions are indeed significant.
Third, if some provinces are currently slow to catch up in the second half of the year, they may be at greater risk.
In such cases, the process of using central awards to advance the process of productive capacity may have some negative impact.
First, it's not easy to control the total amount of capacity.
Our aim is to re-establish the new business of the entire coal industry through the phase-out of backward capacity to optimize the structure.
In the deployment of capacity, local governments must combine the transformation of de-capacity with the coal industry and to develop the relevant services.
Secondly, to complete this year's production mission, we're going to have to fully exercise the power of administrative oversight and administrative inspection.
Finally, we need to strengthen the bottom of social security.
Because the market is directly involved in employment, we need to strengthen employment skills training for employees and employees.
"The decline in ranking is due to the deterioration of foreign investment in GDP development in Brazil in the medium term ... "
Brazil ' s participation in global direct investment in 2015 was 3.7 per cent, down from 5.7 per cent in 2014.
The Swiss Bank International Investment Attractive Index includes four sub-indexs: infrastructure, economic prospects, business environment and direct investment volume.

"There are 288 Greenfield Investments in Brazil, compared to 314 annual averages for 2003-2014."
However, in the first half of 2016, international direct investment in Brazil reached $38.3 billion, an increase of almost 10 per cent over the same period last year.
Original title: Canadian police killed IS supporters: Home-made bomb attack and city preparations are nearing end
Taxi company said the taxi was transferred to Dreyffer's house before the police arrived.
In a press conference on Wednesday, the Canadian police said that the information received by the FBI included the "Runnel Video" provided by the FBI about the attack on the young man.
According to German voice, a man in the screen with a black Baraklaw hat is reading the Koran, referring to crimes against Muslims and vowed to attack a city in Canada soon.
He said in the video that the attack would take place in 72 hours and at peak time.
The incident was the first time that the police killed a terrorist suspect before the incident, when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came to power last year.
The upgraded Kyoto Canal branch route, the old Manfook River, charged a pass from September 1st.
The two tributaries are being modified in a social financing manner, at a fee approved by the relevant provincial government departments.
The old Manfook channel flows through the Golden Village, the Fish Station, entering the main channel of the Kyohang Canal through Nanyang Lake, 32.5 km long.
According to the need for navigation, the old Manfook route has been modified in a way that has been dredging the local depth, and the local emergency bends are being cut straight, etc., and the conditions of flight have improved.
The channel flows through the Golden Village County, the city of Nangyang, entering the main channel of the Kyohang Canal, 19 km long.
Construction of the two routes began in February 2011 and completed the delivery and acceptance of work in January 2015, with investment in construction and operation of the Anping Canal Logistics Service Centre in Jinning City.
In accordance with the principle of "credit construction, fee-paying", the Anping Canal Logistics Service Centre in Jeenning City collects a route at the rate approved by the Shandong Price Authority.
Of these, the basic toll is charged at 1.75 yuan/heavy tons, and the mileage ton is charged at 0.05 yuan/km.
The fee is charged from 15 June 2016 to 14 June 2019.
Journalists learned from the Jinning Port Authority that there are currently four toll lanes in Jeenning, the Su Shui River, the White Horse River, the Hokka Slipway, the Old Manfook River.
Four routes are the tributary lanes of the Kyohang Canal, which are upgraded in a socially financed manner.
The upgrade of the Su Shui River channel was the first project to adopt the "Government+market" model for the construction of the river port infrastructure in Shandong Province, with the government taking over the main investment, the social fund supplement.
The white horse, the old Manfook, the North Sluice, and so on are the way they operate in pure market.
The State's financial allocation does not meet the needs of construction, limiting the progress of the course upgrade.
The construction of social funds for public infrastructure is in line with the requirements of national policies and is also a way to break financial bottlenecks.
Ning Zetao's performance in the 100-metre free swim semi-finals has left many Chinese viewers silent.
But in the 50-metre free swim pre-swam, Ningzawatao has once again refreshed people's bottom line.
In fact, 50 meters of free swim is not the main Ning Zetao, his performance and best performance at the Kazan World Championship, and has determined that he is unlikely to make a breakthrough in this project.
It's true that the Hong Kong Authority Media's "Big Bulletin" revealed that the biggest reason for Ning Zetao's loss is that he's lost interest in swimming.
Many of the factors outside the field may have had a great impact on his future ideas, and he may now be more interested in entering the entertainment business.
After the Kazan World Championship, Ning Zetao became a net red with its super-high and good grades.
So, the names of "national husband", "Sweet meat", "Face Man" and so on, they're always labeling him.
All kinds of business activities come to the door, a good way to money, and become a golden path.
In this case, Ning Zetao, even if he chooses to retire at this time, not only his freedom, but also a path that seems feasible.
After all, he's 23 years old, and after a certain study, he can do one or two TV shows with his human spirit.
But Ningzawatao needs to see if he has enough qualifications compared to these elders?
The 2000 Sydney Olympics, 21-year-old Liu Xian, have arrived at the end of the sports career.
Liu Xian's beautiful appearance quickly made her remember and laid the foundation for her future entry into the entertainment business.
After he retired, Liu Xian played several TV shows and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tan-Lang participated in two Olympic single-two-metre games and won two gold and two silvers.
But after losing to his teammate Hu Jia in the 2004 Olympic single-person 10-metre race, the race went down and was fired from the dive team.
And he and his daughter went to the "Where Dad's going" show, and he made his eyeballs.
The old gymnastics generation Yang Wei, Li Xiao Peng and Chen Yi-Chi are high-profile in a variety of art shows.
It's worth mentioning that Yang Wei Li Xiao Peng led China to win the 2008 Olympic Men's Championship, and Yang Wei won the personal gold medal twice, known as the Almighty King.
Chen Yi Bing, while leading China's 2012 Olympic group championship, became the Ring King.
And after the miscalculation of the gold medal at the London Olympics, Chen's ice was a big deal of money.
But the main energy of these athletes is still on the field, and the show is just like a dragonflies -- and they're leaving.
But whether retired and active athletes, they need to be guaranteed by the entertainment industry.
After all, athletes are entering a new field, both in power and human connections, a blank state.
Even the old man who's been in the entertainment business for years, and the average audience has been talking about them, and more thinking about their performance at the Olympics.
And Yang Wei, Li Xiao Peng and others, introduced the show, without exception, the Olympic champion.
The name of a swimming world championship in Ningzawatao is a little thin compared to the above.
Besides, Ning Zetao, if he was 23 years old, he was in a state of shock, and the negative impact on his image was probably incalculable.
After all, when you talk about athletes, people are asking for "no battle, but not to be afraid of it."
Ten thousand steps back, Ningzawa-tao is so handsome and can be supported by a thousand brain-drained powders.
It's harder to train to find a response.
The path to life is based on the will of the individual, but how it should be in Ningzawa-tao.
On the surface, the social platform on the Internet has expanded the circle and reduces people's loneliness.
The wider power of Internet socialization, not only gradually replacing traditional telephone contacts, even in the real life circle below the line, changing the social life of the current people.
The benefits of online socialization are obvious, such as convenience and speed, so it's particularly vulnerable to young people.
A survey of university social habits shows that 57% of university students use their phones for more than five hours a day, and that daily life is basically "the machine."
" Social networking has low-cost, fast transmission, multi-person communication, etc., in line with the needs of contemporary university students ... "
Expanding the human circle, talking more equally, avoiding social concerns is the main reason for our growing love line.
New people who just got into the company love to communicate online with their colleagues, "Because we don't know each other well, they're much closer to the social platform."
Friends are also used to communicate online, "I haven't been in touch with friends for a while because of some mistakes, and then we're talking in a big group to get hot."
IT engineer Wu is a deep online social lover, and most of his social life is online, and Internet contacts are multiple times more than the number of online friends.
Wu says he's more like fish on the Internet.
"You can answer friends when you can easily, because there are many time to think about words and more clearly. "
"You come under ID and I avoid face-to-face human collisions, not only have room for spin, but even give each other more time and space to think about each other. "
" People in different identities have the right and efficiency to speak the same, social concerns in real life, and seem to be eliminated in cyberspace. "
But Wu's friend Peng thinks that Wu's words in life are "a boring houseboy".
Peng and Wu Zheng met in a big group because they were both active speakers and soon met.
Peng thinks Wu and the Internet are just saying, "Oh, okay, yeah," or "I'm gonna check this online."
The mausoleum police are now involved in the investigation and the mausoleum water transport department will also strengthen its efforts to manage illegal vehicles.
"The conflict police on 4 August have not yet found a survey, and on 11 August, two other drivers' taxis were hit again at the residence. "
"The tricycles are now operating illegally at night, hoping that the authorities will also strengthen their efforts to fix them ... "
South China Sea Network journalists learned from the Public Security Bureau of the Mau Shui-Li Autonomous District that the police have currently received reports of both cases, the causes of both cases, who did it, whether or not the connection was further investigated.
Wang Wenyi, Chief of Transport and Transport, the Maung Water Transport Department, said that the Maung Water Transport Department had begun to operate illegal passenger tricycles at the beginning of this year, and had banned 613 illegal passenger tricycles.
Next, the transport department will apply to the county government, and the joint multisectoral will strengthen its efforts to fix illegal vehicles such as tricycles, motorcycles, black cars, etc.

On August 11th, when the journalist called back to Wong Elin, Sichuan's house, she said, "It was too urgent, and I had only one thought of saving people!"
Wong Elin is a student at the 2015 class of the Grand Landscape College of Central South Linco.
Huang Yilin, a student in urban and rural planning, went to Sichuan to study local architectural designs, and a family was able to travel.
On August 8th, around 10:00 a.m., Wong Elin's father took a break at the hotel and the mother and daughter were ready to go to the city of Central City.
Just walked away, and suddenly I saw a bunch of people yelling and walking up out of curiosity.
"The little boy is gone, the little girl is in the water, and the river shows her little head and sinks from time to time," and Wong Elin, who learned to swim, jumped down in a hurry to save people.
After the water, Wong Elin, 165 centimeters tall, found out it wasn't going to end!
It looked calm before, and it was a current!
But she still swims to the little girl.
Wong Eileen said that the river was so gruesome, anxious, less than five meters away, almost spent all her strength.
She did everything she could to push the little girl to the dyke, "The slope is so smooth, I'm afraid I'm not strong enough to sink."
So Wong Elin called her mother for help, heard her daughter's call for help, and Ms. Yoon, who was not well watered, stopped by the tourists next to it.
On August 10th, following the spread of the rescue of Huang Yilin, Ms. Yoon received a lot of condolences and friends and friends and friends, while being praised by a lot of family and friends.
"Now it's really scary to remember! To be honest, my heart is breaking when the child is dying on the river embankment. "
Ms. Yoon said that, despite her danger, she would still support her daughter's choice if she was in such a scene again, and she was proud of her daughter!
Because of being forced, Wong Elin rarely went in after learning to swim, "I didn't think that skills were really useful."

Sun Fu is a party leader, with a loss of ideal faith, a serious violation of party discipline, and after the 18th year of the party, he will not stop, he is in a bad nature, a serious situation.
After the case, after many media reports, it became a focus case, and society had a very bad impact.
After the case, the head of the Public Security Bureau of Haikou City Police was highly valued and immediately organized a team of good police forces to launch a investigation.
The police immediately followed the suspect online, took a variety of measures to control and contact the field police to identify the whereabouts of a country by contacting the field police.
As the suspect was a common prisoner, it was repeatedly addressed by the public security authorities, with a strong anti-detection capability, combined with his long-term drug use, questioning poisoning addiction, and interrogation was very difficult.
Greenland sharks, also known as small head sleeping sharks, are widely located in Greenland and the North Atlantic Sea around Iceland, with an adult capacity of 4 to 5 metres.
But they grow at a very slow pace, sometimes about a year, which suggests that Greenland sharks may have a very long life.
Traditional annual methods usually use animal calcium tissue, and some sharks can use fin ridges, but this calcium tissue is rare in Greenland sharks.
New research led by Ulius Nelson of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, and the use of Greenland shark eye crystals for the year of radioactive carbon measurements.
This method was previously used to determine the age of whales, but it was the first time to determine the age of fish like sharks.
Their analysis shows that the largest shark life in this head is estimated at 392 years and an error of 120 years.
That means the shark is at least 272 years old, and it's probably 512 years old.
In addition, the female Greenland shark is said to be mature by about 4 metres long, converted to age at least 156 years old.
The researchers therefore wrote in their paper that Greenland sharks are known to be on Earth, the longest-lived vertebrates, exceeding the former long-lived champion, the spinal whale (211).
Since a year, the exchange rate of the renminbi has remained largely stable and has also laid the foundation for promoting the internationalization of the renminbi.
In terms of market performance, the two-way floating characteristics of the renminbi exchange rate have been evident over a year, with increased exchange rate elasticity and overall stability of exchange rates.
So far, the renminbi has been more volatile than 100 points in the middle price of the dollar, but the process has increased and depreciated.
Last year, the last re-entry measure before the re-remitigation of 8.11 was implemented in 2005 and the renminbi has appreciated significantly over the United States dollar over the decade.
Since the new transfer was implemented, the renminbi changed its previous appreciation, with an average exchange rate of about 8% in a year.
On October 1, this year, the International Monetary Fund will formally accept the renminbi as a heavy currency for SDR.
This week, statistics published by the China Customs Administration show that China ' s total import and export value was 13.21 trillion yuan in the first seven months of this year, a 3 per cent decrease from the same period last year.
In July, China ' s total imports and exports declined by only 0.9 per cent over the same year, especially exports by 2.9 per cent over the same year.
Experts believe that despite signs of stability in July, there should be no high expectations of imports and exports.
In July, China ' s total import and export value was RMB 20.9 trillion, a decrease of 0.9 per cent over the same period.
Of these, exports of RMB 1.22 trillion grew by 2.9 per cent; imports of 8.73 billion yuan fell by 5.7 per cent; trade surplus of $34.2.8 billion, an increase of 34 per cent.
Despite the decline in total imports and exports over the same period, export data have increased, which has also been growing for the fifth consecutive month since March this year.

According to the Chinese Voice News Night Summit, in late August, Japanese Prime Minister Abe will travel to Kenya to attend the Sixth African Development Conference.
The African Development Conference, led by Japan, was held in Tokyo, Japan or Yokohama, and will therefore be the first transfer to Africa.
In this regard, officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan have indicated that local meetings in Africa have helped to raise concerns about Japan by African and European countries.
In order to cooperate with Abe's visit, the Japan Self-Minist Party will send members of Parliament to the countries concerned.
It was a coincidence that the Japan-sponsored African Development Conference, which was launched in 1993!
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations and is a major United Nations ticket warehouse. How can Japan abandon Africa if it wants to be "unusual"?
There will also be an exchange of views with interested persons on extremist organizations, the Islamic State and terrorist activities.
The Western Group will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau.
Wen Hsiung, Japan, has recently explained its intentions at the United Nations Security Council about the African Development Conference.
Abe announced in this regard that, for the stability of sub-Saharan African countries, it would provide 100 billion yen (approximately RMB 6.1 billion) in five years.
Observers generally believe that Japan ' s generosity to Africa has been for two main purposes: one is to increase Japan ' s sense of existence in Africa; and the second is to gain support from African countries on a regular issue.
According to the Japanese expert Yang Bojiang, "In political terms, Africa, although relatively lagging behind, has a large number of countries, so Japan has always considered it the so-called "large ticket field".
Japan will not give up in the future, and its work for Africa will not end and will continue to strengthen.
Economic aspects, because Japan has a strong productive capacity, but the domestic market is relatively limited, especially in the context of the ageing of young children.
But from Shinichiro Koizumi 10 years ago to Abe 10 years later, Japan has launched many times, but the usual "scramble" has returned to the feathers.
Japanese expert Yang Bojiang believes that Japan's common intentions are clear, but the road to normality must be difficult.
Japan ' s goal is to achieve its goals first and foremost with the surrounding countries, where Japan needs a right attitude, whether geopolitics or ethnic disputes and historical awareness issues.

The introduction of traditional practices to the opening of the Hong Kong Park of the 2016 Luang Cultural Festival
The music of the drums, the traditional snacks, the fancy decorations, the crowd's raging scene.
The 2016 Zhulan Cultural Festival, hosted by the Hong Kong Tide Association, was held in Victoria Park from 12 to 14th, the largest award in Hong Kong.
Besides continuing the existing Lonely Competition, the family has added the "child basin for the stacking."

A couple from France stayed at the scene for almost three hours and experienced it in the mini-flower mobile classroom.
"I found this special holiday online, so I decided to look at it, and it felt fresh."
They say that while France has a similar holiday to commemorate its predecessors, it's a heavy atmosphere, unlike here, there's music, food and traditional crafts.
She said, "This busy financial city in Hong Kong can see the ceremony of worshiping ancestors on such a scale, organized manner."
"This is not only a reflection of the diversity of Chinese culture, but also allows more people to understand these traditional crafts and inherit them. "
The President of the event said, "We don't want to put the Zhulan Cultural Festival in a scary place, and it's too scary to approach, especially children."

The passion of the Mexican audience has impressed the white lady's role, the young actor.

On the morning of 12th, Liu Chiu hosted a symposium to hear reports on the advancement of the pilot work of the Twin Cities in Sanya City and the recommendations of the relevant departments.
Liu Chiu has given full recognition of the results of the pilot process and the good experience that has been created.

Dun Yaping won 18 world championships in 14 years of sports and became the first to win four Olympic gold medals in Chinese Olympic history.
She's got the world's top eight years in the ping table, the longest female athlete in the history of ping-pong.
26 September 2010, Under-Secretary-General of the People ' s Daily News and General Manager, People ' s Search Network Shares, and cadres at the main office level.
She will work with Yu Min Hong to build the country's first platform for innovation in the sports industry.
There are also a group of star coaches on the Chinese body: they have won countless glory for the country in the age of athletes; they have taught the rest of the years after retirement, and they have raised the championship.
As the first world champion of Chinese man gymnastics, Huang Yubin retired and chose to take the whip.
From the female team coach to the male coach, to the chief coach, Huang Yubin built an Olympic gold group, and the team achieved 9 gold 1 silver 4 copper myths at the Beijing Olympics.
Since then, Tani Liang has been advertising, and has played important roles like "Cow" and "Ray" in recent years.
A lot of NBA players have proven their strength, but someone who's making progress is falling.
Whether it's because of age or time for appearance, some players are moving back every season.
Of course, some of the "repeated" may be just a shrink of data, and the players may not have fallen.
Even if Wade was one of the best points in the league, he wouldn't be as hot as a bull.
He and Lundo have limited rear range, and the three-point hit rate of the star Butler is only 32.8%, which will make their attack crowded next season.
When he comes to Wind City, the Flash will give the ball more to Butler and Lundo, and probably choose to feed in the regular race.
The situation in Okaf is more embarrassing, and as the first option for 76 people last season, he had to compete with Simmons and Enbid in the new season.
This competition may not come soon, Simmons needs to adapt to the NBA field, and Enbid will recover completely from his injuries as soon as possible, but Ocafo's position is still a problem in the 76-person long-term formation.
Last season, 32 per cent of Okaf scores came from low-level attacks, a higher percentage than Cosins, Vuchevich and Brooke Lopez, while his usage rate was high in the top 40.
As Simmons has shown a great control front potential, Enbid has a better body for NBA, and Ocafo's position is probably so strong.
Thompson's usage has been stable in the last two seasons, and this is the two best seasons of his career.
But the problem is, as Durant comes, Thompson's usage will decline, which will affect his performance.
This impact will not only be the impact of the number of hands, but the Tom God's ball attack will certainly decrease significantly next season, which in some ways will also reduce the difficulty of his opponent's defense against him.
Durant's arrival will make the warriors' data shrink, but the worst of them is Thompson.
But that doesn't mean that the soup god's level retreat is more like he's sacrificed for the whole team.
Parker did better last season than the data reflect, not only because his basket had the highest efficiency, but his chemical reaction and Aldrich benefited the sting team.
Duncan retired, Ginobilly announced another year, and the GDP mix ended up at the end, as the youngest of the three, and there was not much oil in the French racer tank.
After getting the third champion ring, only Jabal, Jordan and Russell had won more regular MVPs than James, and Jordan was the only FMVP more than James.
Oh, by the way, James just brought Cleveland's first professional sports championship in the last 52 years.
James, who came to the 14th season of his career, needs better physical strength to prepare for the post-season race.
So, in the regular race, James' data is likely to decline further, and he'll share more weight to Owen, but he'll still be the top three players in the League.
"You must spread the talent learned from the country in Russia."
On 12th local time, Huang Jing, President of the Moscow Federation of Chinese Expatriate, was excited to see a journalist on the Chinese Net.
A few days ago, she participated in a training course on Chinese talent (calligraphy, painting) hosted by the Office of the Chinese State Department of Foreign Affairs and South University.
When I first attended the training course, I had no idea where to start books, and they could draw and write their own work after the course.
When you return to Moscow, you must contribute to the spread and promotion of Chinese culture with the knowledge and skills you have learned.
The Secretary-General of the Russian Cultural Promotion Council of China, who also participated in this course, felt the same way.
She said she had made great progress with the help of the teacher in the course, and felt the heavy responsibility of being a Chinese culture overseas distributor.
The Yen Wei said that he would spread and promote Chinese traditional culture among Chinese and Russians who loved Chinese culture.

The British won silver medals in the seven-man football game. Fiji won the gold medal.
In the seven-man football finals on Thursday night, the British team failed to continue his outstanding performance before the Fiji team, defeated by the Fiji team at Rio Diodoro Stadium by 43-7.
Fiji won the gold medal with the unfailing performance of controlling, breaking, avoiding, co-operation, running and power, and this is the first Olympic medal in the country's history.
Silver is also a great comfort to the defeated British team, the third silver card that the British delegation won that day. This is enough to make the British football team proud: they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on their first seven-man football game.
Earlier that day, the British won the South African team with seven to five, which could affect their state in the finals.
But anyway, the Fiji team is enough to defeat a full 15-person team.
Tomorrow, at least one British will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort to the British team, but it may not.
It's hard for the British team to get what we're doing today.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's teaching, they didn't taste the winnings at the seven-man football game in Adelaide.
And now they're only one step away from the champion.
They've been hit hard, but they've made remarkable progress.
Fiji has the advantage of the opening of the game, making the British no power.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like hitting a series of buses that were on the way, and when Osie Colliniso ran into the corner flag area, the world championship team was already ahead of five to zero.
The game was only four minutes later, and Jerry Tuway scored on the right wing.
Twelve to zero, the British team barely hit the ball.
Mitchell's strong resistance has left the giant Leon Nacarava without a third score, but it just slows Fiji's score.
In seven minutes, Yasa Willemaru touched the right corner. 17-0, the British team was worse.
The Karava gets another point, and the first half of the game is one minute left.
Then Wattmo Lavovo broke down the British defense and reached the score line.
At the middle break, the score is 29 to 0.
Fijians are born to play seven-man football, and the British are still the first to be born.
That's what happened.
The British team made a huge change in the second half of the game and hit the Fijii line in four minutes, and this was already good in the first half. But then Fiji made a great deal, and Joshua Tuesova scored again.
Dan Norton created a chance to score for the British team, and he changed the score to 36-7 on the left corner, but the game was already under the control of the South China Sea Island, where their fans sang, waved the flag and danced.
Fiji's great performance is a quick one.
Marta William stopped a non-called attack by Fiji at the last minute.
The final whistle was ringing, and the Fijians hugged together, and the lost British team had to regret leaving.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated the Japanese team in the semi-finals by 20 to 5, while Britain won the South African team in a fierce semi-finals.
Kyle Brown helped South Africa to lead the first half, but Dan Norton scored with a great foot break.
Then the England team Anthony's brother Marcus Watson made sure the team won with a wonderful intercept, and eventually the British won the silver medal.
Helen Graf and Heather Stanning were inspired by cancer coaches, winning the gold medal of the boat.
No exaggeration, it's the most moving gold medal.
Helen Graf and Heather Stanning have been trained 220 times since the first row, and the gold medal they won in Estacio da Lagoa has more extraordinary significance.
Although the only two of them were rowing, there was a man on board, Coach Robin Williams, who was accompanied by their second consecutive female double oar Olympic gold medal, the first British team to reach this height.
They've kept 39 undefeated records, with absolute advantages.
What we see is that these two genius athletes are on the surface with grace, but that's not all of this victory.
There are many voluntary help behind each boat gold medal, which is the one whose constant dedication has created different things, and the greatest of which is more than a coach who learned that he had cancer 30 months ago and didn't know if he could see the day alive.
As he said, death could come any minute.
I had bladder cancer. They had surgery for me.
If you don't have surgery, cancer cells will spread to the whole body.
So, it's gonna be worse.
It'll change your mind a little.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he started treatment in early 2014 and minimized the impact, although it might not be appropriate in such a case.
I need to get my pay, so I have to get better.
It's an incentive for me.
I live in a hospital, and although they say a few steps is enough, but I walk 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet each time I go around the ward.
That's the beginning of everything.
The boat movement itself is a journey, which makes it a little longer.
At the moment of gold, they first thought of Williams, a little bit more talk about this morning than usual, to overcome his anxiety.
Stanning, former leader of the Royal Artillery Team, will travel to Afghanistan, and she said, "I'm in a bad mood this week and may be a little extreme, but this gold medal is really very interesting."
It told me how important it was to me, how much I, Helen and Robin did.
This is Helen, Robin and I worked hard for three years.
Without Robin, we're just nobody. Thank you very much. He's the best coach in the world.
I can't find a better trainer and coach than him.
Helen Graf and Heather Stanning haven't lost in five years.
The punishment set for the combination is beyond their rivals.
Even at the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Danish teams were approaching, Stanning and Graf had a lot of physical reserves.
It was amazing.
Helen screamed, "Stand the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It's really important not to be influenced by the opponent.
We have a good start, and we don't expect anything amazing.
We didn't think about the glory of today, we just wanted to draw every oar and win this game, and we did it.
It took a year to decide your future.
Graf will marry Steve Buckshar next month.
But now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don't want to say it's my last game.
It'll put too much pressure on me.
In London, it took me about six months to realize I was an Olympic champion.
It's a whole new experience, and I'm very nervous.
It's been about four minutes.
She said, "I feel better."

Snapchat's "magic" effect is ironic to Asians.
Snapchat says the filter is inspired by the animation, but some observers think it's racial.
The 150 million daily users of Snapchat can change reality through their filter tools and make people funny.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a role in Roy Lihitenstein's painting.
These lenses have passivation, bending features, producing over 30 million modified self-portraits a day.
Any mistake will be immediately noticed by the public.
Snapchat lenses were criticized and the application was accused of playing black or white skin.
So when the application provides some users this week with a filter that can create tilt eyes, weird teeth and face effects, some commentators call it racial irony about Asian yellow people.
They even think that these repeated problems mean that the company has a greater diversity problem.
After Snapchat said it was deleted, Wednesday's report by The Verge and Motherboard provoked anger.
The company explains that the filter salutes the role of the animation, not the irony Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of harmful stereotypes in reality.
Others are also strongly opposed to these animation images.
An Korean American artist who tweets these photos and widely shared said in an e-mail that these filters were "at least painful and uncomfortable".
She also said, "It's hard to distinguish between the effects of the extremely disgusting Asian sarcasm image and filter."
Although the filters are not just yellow, but yellow people are extremely devalued.
Snapchat is not the only company that touches these cultural lines.
From the company board to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusiveness.
Snapchat's large young group may be sensitive because of more racial diversity than the old generation.
When a filter in Snapchat created an insult to the user, 25-year-old Juketti said in an interview on Thursday, "This kind of thing is harder to escape people's eyes than before."
On Thursday, Ms. Chu, who was a product manager and engineer in Mediam, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article written by Mediam and a telephone interview, she said she felt that racial disputes reflected Snapchat's lack of racial diversity in the recruitment process.
Ms. Chu criticized the company's majority of its employees for being white, and the leadership was all male and added a label at the end of the article:
As a Chinese American, Ms. Chu said, " Either they don't have all kinds of people among their employees, so they can make such decisions, or some colored people among their employees, but their positions cannot make them speak freely. "
Other observers shared the complaints she had not responded by Snapchat.
The company did not publish data on the diversity of employees and indicated that it was a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of its employees, but one spokesman stated that the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on lower internal populations and to promote internal inclusion.
Ms. Chu said she would close her Snapchat account number: "I wonder if they needed more users who are against this act like us."
The congressional team said that military officials distorted ISIS intelligence.
In a report released on Thursday, a panel of Congress noted that officials of the United States Central Command had changed their intelligence reports to describe the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than the reality.
This interim report comes from a dedicated working group organized by the Military Committee of the House of Representatives, the Intelligence Committee and the Republican Chairman of the Defence Sub-Commission of the House of Representatives. The report states that the Central Command intelligence analysts have "a wide-ranging disgruntled" that their superiors were tampering with their assessment of the war between the United States and the Islamic State.
The Central Command in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for regulating United States military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news report on the report, " intelligence reviewed by the Central Command senior leaders is more optimistic about the United States counter-terrorism operations than the actual situation and is always more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies. "
The Republican representative of California said, "The central command's actions are unacceptable... and our fighters suffer from war, and the other is the wrong analysis by high-level policymakers."
The leadership of the Central Command has extended to the top of the agency.
The report details the long-standing problems of the Central Command in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analysing the training of the Iraqi army in the United States.
Although there is no evidence of certainty that the Obama administration's top officials ordered changes to these reports, according to the description of the report, these analysts feel under pressure from the central command leaders to make more optimistic views on the threat of the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
The report states that " in the first half of 2015, many central command press releases, statements and parliamentary testimony were much more optimistic than the actual situation. "
For example, an official of the Central Command publicly stated that he might take a large military operation in April or May 2015 to take back Mosul.
The second largest city in Iraq is still under the control of the Islamic State.
In a statement, Mike Pompeyo, a Republican representative of Kansas, said, "This result is clear after months of investigation. "
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most senior intelligence officers of the United States Central Command have manipulated the command intelligence products and hide the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq.
After learning from analysts that information about the Islamic State was manipulated, a dedicated task force was established.
As the investigation continues, more will be found after this report released on Thursday.
The Attorney General of the Ministry of Defence has also conducted a long-term investigation into the Central Command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their findings on Thursday, consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
In a statement, the Democratic Leader of the Commission ' s Democratic Party, Sheanda, stated that between 2014 and 2015, the Central Command had developed an too narrow process for the intelligence assessment of the Islamic State and Iraqi peacekeeping forces ... "
Mr. Sheanda said that the process "prohibited the release of information", reduced the morale of analysts and "unacceptable to disagree."
But Mr. Sheanda and Democrats also stated that they had not found any evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on the Central Command analysts, so that their conclusions were consistent with "preset or political narratives."
The Beast Daily reported the preliminary results of the Congress investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported a complaint from the Central Command analyst, the Pentagon Attorney General began an investigation.
In a statement, Major Patrick Evans, the Pentagon spokesman, stated that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the report of the Congress until the Attorney General ' s investigation was not completed.
But he said, " Experts sometimes disagree about the interpretation of complex data, while intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security themes. "
The impact of this investigation has exceeded the success of the United States-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria (a growing number of defence officials claim).
But last year, these claims enabled the public to question how much President Obama could trust the military operations assessment issued by the Central Command in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of information about the Islamic State reminds the controversy of more than a decade ago, when the Central Command intelligence analyst Gregory Hook wrote a research article stating that George Bush's government insisted on sending small troops to Iraq, despite the opposition of many analysts and had little consideration of the post-invasion situation in 2003.
Mr. Hook played a key role in this opposition to the Islamic State's intelligence.
Last year, officials stated that Mr. Hook ' s team concluded that the air strikes against the Islamic State Refinery did not significantly reduce the economic revenues of terrorist organizations, as the terrorist organization had built the temporary refineries continued to sell oil on the black market, which was quite different from the statement published.
According to Times in September, the Central Command did not publish this discovery.
When several lawyers reviewed the Senate testimony about excessive optimism about the war, the Central Command Commander Lloyd Austin III was criticized last year.
General Austin retired in April and is currently being replaced by Joseph Waterer in his position at Central Command.
America wins four times in the women's hockey game, and it's going to win with England.
Katie Bam, who won Japan in the 6-1 game, took the lead in the American women's hockey team twice on Thursday, helping the American team beat India with three to zero.
Two games, five goals were amazing, but 27-year-old Bam said she didn't know she had such a great performance.
She said, "I don't know anything about it."
I'm not the kind of guy who remembers how many balls I've ever had.
All she knows is that the American team has won four times at the Olympics and will compete first with the team who won the Japanese team on Thursday by 2-0.
Britain and the United States met in the last round of Saturday.
Both teams will be a quarter final, and this game will determine who appears as the first of the team.
The first team to get the team will avoid meeting a strong Dutch team, so that it can go further.
In the Saturday game, the American team made miracles with amazing performance, and you know, at the London Olympics four years ago, the American team laid the bottom of 12 teams.
Bam was in the team.
Bam grew up in Brubel, Pennsylvania, and first picked up hockey bats when she was three and joined the National Team at 16 and became the youngest national team ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she failed to get to the final list.
In 2012, she and her teammates were not treated well.
The following year, the British Craig Panam was the coach, and everything started to change.
Bam said, "This is a cultural, mental and material change."
We didn't reach our current level in London.
We're here to turn around.
Thursday night, Barm pulled his head in the first half of the game with a close backhand shot.
India has not yet tasted the winner in this game, but this team showed amazing tenacity and kept the score of 1-0 to the end of the third section, when Bam broke out.
She led the ball along the left side of the field, then cut inside to the middle road, shot into the net, two to zero in the U.S. team.
Melissa Gonzales shot the last shot in mid-section four.
The U.S. versus Jackie Briggs for the first time in this game, and in the first three championships, each hit one.
She's playing a lot this time.
So is Bam.
Panam says, "We're in good shape," but it depends on the results of the Saturday game.
The sour food in the Great Depression.
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was just elected President, sat in the President's office for lunch.
As a predator, President Roosevelt likes the food on Fifth Avenue, like foie liver sauce and Maryland stew.
That day, his menu was simple: ketchup devil eggs, mashed potatoes and fruit pudding as snacks.
Jane Zigman said, "This is for food with the suffering."
Her husband Andrew Co. added, "This also reflects the way Americans eat."
These couples living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Mr. Co.'s last book, "The Scramble", was about American Chinese food, and Ms. Zigman told the story of the slum tenants through food in her book "97 orchard".
The new book "The Great Food" they co-authored will be published on Tuesday by Harper Press, which presents the history of American food during the Great Depression.
After showing some common views on food, they met a journalist at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a simple lunch counter in the ironing area, which has been open since the economic collapse in 1929.
Ms. Zigman, 54, ordered a cream cheese with a broken olive sandwich, while 57-year-old Mr. Co. ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable platters.
The reporter ordered a meatloaf that the couple thought they were suitable for the Great Depression.
Ms. Zigman said, "The bread was very popular."
There were peanut bread, liver bread, soybean bread.
They're all made of a raw material and a cheap head that can be watered on the raw material.
Imagine, your dinner was peanuts.
Mr. Co. has a weird picture.
He said, "They must be like lead in your stomach."
In the years before the Great Depression, Americans were buffets, especially in the suburbs.
A bunch of women cook for male farm workers, breakfast, lunch and dinner with pies that have just been tested.
In World War I, it was the Americans who gave food to hungry Europeans.
Mr. Coe explained why he and his wife were writing this book: "It was the main topic that made Americans unhappy."
Another unpleasant topic is the new food of cold acid: "Face food" like bread and stew became the main dish, and the stew was the best way to cook leftovers, and Ms. Zigman said it was because the cooks could use cream in the sauce to cover up the bad food.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dry fruit.
The meat that has been leading the American table for years has become a rare luxury.
Strange twilight is only about calories, and people think about nutrition than taste, even basic cooking common sense.
In the study of the book, including recipes, Ms. Zigman produced a roasted onions filled with peanut oil.
Mr. Ko said, "This is not common at dinner table."
Ms. Zigman said, "This is weird."
peanut oil and roasted onions can't match.
It's a feature of many family economic meals.
Family economists influence the country's eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, chef of the Federal Family Economics Agency from 1923 to 1943, which is the most unique in history.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to "precision" and to turn bad food like cream pasta with carrots into food.
"Big meal" is a great "History treasure".
Especially fun is the government's response to hungry people, like the President's citizen Herbert Hoover, "I can't handle anyone else's business."
Although he publicly praised his childhood for a simple Iowa farm, his diet was as sophisticated as a millionaire.
Mr. Ko said, "He likes to eat European Western food, like caviar sauce."
He's wearing a tuxedo, eating in a gold-plated restaurant.
He's obviously out of the people.
If his wife Eleanor encouraged him to set an example on his diet, President Roosevelt might make the same mistake.
As the book says, the housekeepers hired by Ms. Roosevelt are not interested in taste, so the White House is not only the hardest food in Washington, but the worst food in cooking.
When America returns to formality, many ways of cooking during the Great Depression are abandoned.
Ms. Zigman said that our concern for calories and nutrition and applied science to cooking.
The couple said that when writing this book, they learned more about Ms. Zigman's mother's diet, like how she didn't throw away food.
Mr. Ko said, "She's very afraid of wasting food."
Ms. Zigman recalled, "She actually made many people sick."
Like there was a cream puff.
After removing the plate, she and Mr. Coe took out a dessert they had at home: this is the fruit pudding that President Roosevelt at lunch took.
Ms. Zigman said, "It's called cream fruit," and added that a new tide for a normal dish is called "the usual trick."
There's no cream in this dessert, only fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and Cinnamon.
Everyone's been trying to get it into the sticky brown paste.
Surprisingly, this dessert tastes good.
Mr. Cole ate the second spoon, the third key.
He thought it was an acceptable dessert, and he told his wife, "It's better to add some broken walnuts."
Unfortunately, the latest OPEC monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, with Saudi production even higher.
The report does not prohibit market doubts about the credibility of OPEC, and the path to oil price recovery is still full of thorns.
This Monday, the Chairman of OPEC and Minister of Energy of Qatar, Sada, stated that OPEC would hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on 26-28 September.
The monthly report published on Wednesday by OPEC shows that the entire OPEC organization, including Gabon, increased production by 46,000 barrels per day in July to 331.1 million barrels per day.
OPEC also stated in the monthly newspaper that low crude oil prices had led global refiners to produce more refined oil, thereby increasing the level of market oversupply.
As a result of this information, the United States has increased crude oil production expectations and an unexpected increase in crude oil stocks, international oil prices have fallen for two consecutive days.
As of Wednesday, the price of light crude oil futures delivered by the New York Commodity Exchange in September fell by 2.48%, and the price of the London Brent crude oil futures in October fell by 2.07 per cent.
Reuters believes that the proposed oil-producing country conference is unlikely to tighten the supply significantly, and that data published by the US Energy Information Agency have also crushed market people.
The Iranian official news agency Fars quoted the Iranian oil minister Zanga on Wednesday that Iran had a maximum production of 3.85 million barrels of Japanese crude oil, the highest level since 2008.
The news of the meeting just came out that Russian energy minister Novak had indicated that there was no need for a new round of frozen negotiations under oil prices.
The last meeting of the oil-producing countries was in April, and the OPEC member States failed to reach agreement on any measures.
BMIResearch Oil and Gas Analyst Emma Richards said that markets and media might overreact the meetings that OPEC would hold.
Helima Croft, head of the Royal Bank of Canada's bulk commodity strategy, said that OPEC had changed the market by releasing the signal they would contribute to the agreement.
It's like a smoke and mirrors that distract people.
According to Eugene Weinberg, Director of Large Commodity Research, German Commercial Bank, it was believed that OPEC was considered to try to stabilize the market through September.
It's likely to further undermine market confidence in OPEC, after all, this organization has played "The Wolf."

According to the media, as a result of the massive surge of capital into Internet medicine, the current problem of congenerization of products is serious, investment booms are declining and capital entering the watch period.
According to data from the Centre for Management Research at Al-Alipi Hospital in Hong Kong, Internet medical companies have died in a year, and about 20 per cent of start-ups have ceased to exist.
However, as most Internet medical companies struggle on the A or B financing road, several leading companies in the sub-area still have access to capital.
It seems that Internet medical start-ups cannot be "a bee" but rather depends on market demand, sinking and doing deep.
Fish leaps cost $1.20.00 million, 40 per cent of registered capital, $1.80.00 million from Kyushu Tung Tung, 60 per cent of registered capital.
In recent years, with national policy support in medical information, electronicization and integrated supply chain management systems have gradually entered hospitals at all levels.
The cooperation between the fish leap and Kyushu is aimed at market demand, helping hospitals build advanced supply chain management systems and to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet medical companies, iBaby has been focusing on the vertical field of Internet obstetrics, deep-drinked pregnant mothers and doctors from the beginning.

Internet companies, data companies lack professionalism, and are not uniform in writing on the same note.
Ali is currently in three parts of the health sector, Ali Health, Skycat Medicines and the Future Hospital for Pay.
Wang Qian said that medical health start-ups would be harder than any other industry, "It's not just how much it is, it's just a lot of things, but it's just a lot of money, but it's just a lot of money, but it's just a lot of money, but it's just a lot of money, but it's just a lot of money, but it's just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more.
It's easy to see the Olympic Games all night.
The Brazilian Olympics are as hot as the fire, and even when the event is broadcast in the country at midnight, many citizens will stay up late to watch.
In response, the doctor specifically reminded that there are health risks to stay up late and could cause cardiovascular disease.
If you stay up late, the hormone will still be in a state of great deal, and the body will continue to be nervous and excited, and it cannot be restored, it can cause blood vessels, and increase blood pressure, and thus cause cardiovascular disease.
Han Ji-won specifically reminds groups with high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood resin, smoking habits, family history, and other cardiovascular risk factors, such as family history, which are more likely to cause cardiovascular disease if they stay late.
If you stay up late, not only is the cardiovascular function affected, but also the gastrointestinal function, the immune system, the neuroenocrine system will be affected, and even the risk of tumors increases.
For older friends, Han Ji-won suggested not to stay up late to watch the Olympic Games, especially groups with a history of cardiovascular disease.
During the last World Cup football game, Han Chi-won received a 60-year-old patient whose heart infarction triggered or related to staying up late to watch the game.
Han Ji-won introduced that since this year, its department has received some of the 25-year-old heart infarction or brain strokes, largely due to the patient's long-term night lifestyle.
1. Do not stay up late every day and watch your favorite sports project occasionally, and other projects may wait for the next day to watch the replay.
2. To fill water at night, eat more fruit, prevent blood vessels and enhance body immunity.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union brought missiles into Cuba, almost led to a nuclear war in the United States and South.
This incident was seen as the peak of the cold war, called the Cuban missile crisis.
But it's not known that during the Cold War, a strong solar storm had also caused the United States to launch a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, which was not first published by researchers until August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused strong interference with radar and radio communications from the United States military in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the U.S. ballistic missile early warning system for monitoring Soviet missiles.
This paper, completed by researchers at Colorado University in the United States, interviewed American military personnel who were involved in forecasting and analysing solar activities and looked at non-confidential literature.
The paper wrote that in the 1960s, in order to prevent the sudden nuclear war of the Soviet Union, the United States Air Force had a part of the aircraft carrying nuclear warheads flying in the sky.
The U.S. military commanders didn't know that the cause of this interference was solar storm, not the Soviet Union, and ordered the warplanes to be ready for battle.
Fortunately, the solar activity of the United States military began in the late 1950s and its research on Earth electromagnetic interference, which eventually prevented this potential military conflict.
Later, he summarized the information provided by the Air Meteorological Service of the United States Air Force and submitted a detailed report.
The direct consequence of this solar storm is that the United States military has since seen space weather as a operational concern and has established a stronger space weather forecast system.
In their daily travel, citizens found that the car love car was blocked by strange vehicles, and that without access to strange vehicle drivers, they could use the "micro-move" function to solve this problem.
From August 11th, the Sian Traffic Police Micro-service, the Sian Traffic Police, launched the Micro-Trucking Service.
After the launch of this service, in everyday life, citizens can solve such problems by using the "micro-move" function when strange vehicles are not present.
This new service function is one that saves administrative costs; the second is respect and protection of the privacy of citizens; third is 24/7, full-time service.
As long as citizens have micro-credit, they can operate on their own very easily, which is relatively friendly and easy for both sides to move cars, to ease parking difficulties and reduce car-related security cases.
On the other hand, the Sian Traffic Department stated that the traffic police would take different disposal measures based on the actual situation, as appropriate.

On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly published a new version of the American-Japanese Defence Cooperation Pointer in New York, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more aggressive role globally.
This was a press conference in New York by US Secretary of Defense Carter, Secretary of State Kerry, Secretary of Foreign Affairs of Japan, Wen Hwada, and the Secretary of Defence of Japan, Nakaya Won, attended a press conference in New York.
This is the fifth Japanese military assessment report published by the Chinese Civil Think Tank and the fourth launch of the English version.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including overall policy adjustments, military strength, defence budget, military deployment, weapons equipment, institutional development reform, military training, foreign military security cooperation, military security relations in China.
The report states that 2015 is the year of the phased admission of the Abe Government to advance major policy adjustments for several consecutive years in the area of security.
Since then, Japan ' s initiatives in the field of security will be primarily at the operational dimensions of the rule of law, strategic implementation, policy implementation, rather than the significant adjustments and changes in the framework, mechanisms and policies.
The report emphasizes that the Abe Cabinet is trying to reach the "normal nationalization" of Japan through the three breakthroughs, and the Self-Defence Forces are out of international security, strengthening the Japanese-American alliance and the protection against China.

Filling the short board of public sports facilities
Black coalfield warehouse, turning into a football field of "green grass like in"; the factory at the top of the red bricks became a modern stadium.
On the national fitness day, the South Falling Camp Sports and Culture Park outside Hangzhou opened up the mysterious veil.
This was a coal farm, and it was idle more than a decade ago, leaving a lot of illegal buildings and life trash.
After the rehabilitation, it became a sports and cultural park and will be officially open to the public in November, providing free sports spaces to citizens, and undoubtedly opening up a new fertile land for all.
It reminds us of the Hangzhou Chen Yuen School, the Chinese swimming platform's Huang Po Military School, which swims out of many world champions.
The swimming grounds will be constantly produced and vividly interpreted the relationship between competitive sports and sports for all - a rich mass base provides good conditions for the selection of professional players.
The level of competitive sports is closely linked to the foundations of sports for all, and competitive sports depend on sports for all in a sense, and universal sports depend on the conditions of the site.
It was reported that as of 2015, the country ' s per capita stadium was 150 times the size of the new China, but still far behind the sports power.
In June this year, the State Council issued the "Gymnasium for All" programme (2016-2020) to focus on the development of mass sports.
To fill this short board, on the one hand, the relevant departments take full account of the layout of the stadium in their urban planning.
On the other hand, the public stadiums, including in schools, should be as open as possible and as efficient as possible.
The Rio Olympics, which are now on fire, have inspired people's passion and a sense of participation.

In June, after the United States judge discovered that there was a violation of Merk, including perjury and other immoral acts, Giled was exempt from payment of $200 million resulting from the violation of the two patents of Sofibwe and Hawony in Gilid.
In the proceedings on Thursday, United States District Judge Beth Ramboson Freeman stated that Gilid had not to bear the costs incurred by the defence.
Merk is trying to catch up with Giled Giled Giled, who ruled the new generation of hepatitis C drug markets, can cure more than 90% of hepatitis patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilid and Merk sued each other, both claimed to be the owner of the lab work of Sofibwe.
The US-supported forces announced that they had taken Manbydy back from the Islamic State.
The army spokesman said on Friday that all remaining Islamic State soldiers in the city had left, and that United States-supported forces had fully controlled the northern city of Manbiji near the Turkish border.
After the radicals who hide in the city leave, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now sweeping the city.
The Syrian Democratic Forces Alliance, Sharon Darwish, told Reuters that they had saved more than 2,000 civilians abducted by militants.
He told Reuters, "Manby season is under our control, but we're still cleaning."
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent federal taxes.
Hillary Clinton released its 2105 tax returns on Friday, indicating that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent federal taxes.
In 2015, the Clintons charity contributions amounted to $1 million, most of which were contributed to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton had a speech fee of nearly $5.3 million, while the former Secretary of State earned $3 million from publishers Simon and Schuster on a book on her tenure during her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's campaign partner, Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, and his wife Annie Holden, published a 10-year tax returns.
Two men paid 20.3% federal taxes in 2015.
In a statement, Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri stated that Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane would continue to be a financial and transparent pole. "
In contrast, Donald Trump covered up false reasons and took back his previous commitment to publish tax returns.
Although the law does not require, as usual, candidates for the President of the United States should disclose their tax returns.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyer used the IRS audit as a reason to refuse to publish tax returns.
Clinton campaign assistant Ian Sams tweets you're in charge and attached a link to the tax returns for Democratic candidates.
Thursday, Michael Cohen, Special Legal Adviser of Trump, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax returns until the audit was completed.
Those who criticized Trump, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mit Romney and other Republicans, said that Trump's refusal to publish tax returns would raise questions about their net capital, charitable donations, business transactions and other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton caught the issue and released a video on Friday, highlighting the high profile Democrats urged Trump to publish his tax.
On Thursday, she raised this question in a Michigan economic policy speech.
She said to the people, "For decades, he refused to publish his tax returns like other presidential candidates."
According to Politicians News Network, Trump had barely paid a penny tax in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnists quoted several tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, saying that the situation might still be the same.
Federal taxes have become a major problem in the presidential campaign.
Clinton named it after Warren Buffett, a billionaire, who guaranteed at least 30 per cent of the annual income of over $1 million.
President Obama also supports this proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, Birkhel Khasaway, where Buffet asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffet said he was also being audited by IRS, and Trump was not a tax authority, but a voter.
The first tax returns published by Clinton's campaign team were in 2007.
The Clintons currently living in Chabak, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014, and the combined tax rate was about 40.5 per cent.
The Clintons' tax returns in 2015 show that unlike most Americans, their salary income is only $100.
Their main investment is a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons share and interest income is $109,000.

Jewish filmmakers criticized the Berlin Hotel for deleting Israeli phone code according to the Arab client's request -- Reuters News.
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin revealed to the media that the Kebinski Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli phone codes and that the hotel staff said it was in accordance with the requirements of the Arab client, which triggered public opinion.
Claude Longzmann, author of the Jewish Holocaust documentary "The Big Bang", expressed his disappointment at the Kebinski Hotel and published an open letter in Frankfurt, Germany.
During the recent stay, Longzmann wanted to find Israel on the list of telephone codes offered.
But Israel is not among the countries where guests can speak directly from the room.
Israel disappeared in 2016 in Dublin, Germany?
Longzmann wrote.
Instead, guests can call Israel through the call center of the Kebinski Hotel.
To find explanation, the filmmaker asked the hotel front desk.
In his letter, Longzmann said that his answer at the front desk was "shocking him."
Hotel personnel say it's "the decision of the Kebinski Hotel management deliberately."
And the reason for doing this is to make this filmmaker angry.
Longzmann quotes the employee: Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand that the Israeli code be deleted. "
According to the Nande Daily, the Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas Handersman, called it "the shame of shame".
We were surprised to know about this.
This is a great shame in itself.
And it's even more embarrassing in Germany and the hotel chain.
There's no need for any explanation.
"We hope the hotel will draw the right conclusion," the official said.
This incident has triggered a debate online, and everyone thinks it's a scandal.
Some people think the Kebinski Hotel is a "low knee" to meet the demands of Arab clients.
Another post pointed straight to the hotel, "What a shame" and pointed out that the street on the famous Kudam Street was near a synagogue.
According to the Mirror Weekly, the hotel quickly clarified all charges, claiming that everything was "unnegligent" and "pologies" to Longzmann.
The Nande Daily quotes the representative of Kebinski: "No direct command to remove Israel from the fast dial list."
The report also indicates that the Israeli code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to expel Brazilian students who protested
Thursday, in St. Paul, Brazil, students clashed with the police in protesting the reform of the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesters.
The incident was due to the attempt by law enforcement officials to break up students, so the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students participated in the parade and expressed their dissatisfaction with these programs.
To save money, Governor O'Kming of the State of St. Paul plans to close 100 public schools and 300,000 students will be transferred to school.
Some of the students who participated in protest expressed their dissatisfaction with interim President Michelle Temer through graffiti on the wall.
Just a few days before the recent protest, protesters went to the streets to support President Dilma Rosev, who was impeached by the National Senate.
The Scottish biker, Kalm Skinner, won the bike gold medal and returned.
The Scottish biker Kalm Skinner helped the British triad successfully defend the Olympic gold medal after the 2012 London Olympics.
The 23-year-old Glasgow biker replaced his Scottish fellow man, Sir Chris Hoy, became the center of the team. When young Skinner defeated the winning New Zealand team and returned, even the legendary biker was proud of him.
Four years ago, the British team was amazing, and Hoy won the fifth of the six-dollar Olympic gold medal.
The British team is only sixth in the World Bicycle Championship in London in March, and Hoy has been retired since then the British team was brilliant.
During the Beijing Olympics to the London Olympics, the problem with the British team was to replace Jamie Stav, the first round of experts.
That's what the convoy did when Cinders showed up.
Hoy's retirement left a gap, and Chin Imadi and Matt Clapton wanted to fill it.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the British men's team insisted on getting him into the national team, and Skinner finally didn't lose his expectations.
Skinner's partner was Cinders and Kenny who won the gold medal four years ago with Hoy.
And these three British bike races eventually beat the opponent and won the gold medal.
Although Cinders is a little behind, Kenny's leading the team, Skinner kept this lead to the end.
Strategic change is the key to this reversal, and Cinders chose a larger wheel, and therefore slows, which allows Kenny, especially Skinner to keep it up.
Skinner, Kenny and Cinders saw him on the stage.
23-year-old Glasgow biker Skinner said, "This is a shock to me."
I'm just doing my best to make myself famous.
We created the Olympic record in the finals and defeated the world champion.
This is incredible.
Nothing better than this victory.
After winning the gold medal with Kenny and Hoy at the London Olympics in 2012, Cinders admitted to falling on the track in a bad start.
Later, he withdrew the comment, and the British rivals were unable to appeal.
And this victory has no such problem.
Cinders said, "It's like London, on the platform, all British flags."
We just got in formation three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world champions, so it's amazing to be able to defend the Olympic champions.
This is just a game for the seven British team who won 10 bucks in the Beijing Olympics and London Olympics.
If this symbolizes the progress we've made in the last five months, we'll continue to succeed in the bike house for the next five days.
According to Kenny's state, he's not unable to recreate the three gold medals that Hoy won at an Olympic Games.
If that's the case, 12 years younger than Hoy and is also on March 23rd.
This is the same as Hoy.
Kenny's going to start today for a three-day race.
The 28-year-old Bolton said, "I'll focus on this game for a while.
Team games are always the best.
You can win the game with your teammates.
Frankly, a little lonely to win.
Cinders said, "If he can win two other gold medals, he should be awarded the jazz seal."
It was the only game to produce medals that day, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wilkins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doyle, four-km group chases with the fastest grades.
Their grades are 351.943.
The world record of the 2012 London Olympic gold medal winner is 351.659.
The first round and finals (10:42 p.m.) were held today's second game, and Wilkins will undoubtedly be the focus of attention.
Yesterday he had a fight with the competition officer before the qualification, when the competition officer made him measure his height.
In the women's group competition that will end tomorrow, Laura Trot, Joanna Russell Chand, Eleanor Buck and Kate Archibald from Mirgae were promoted to the new world record 413.260.
The British team relies on its powerful field bike team to take the initiative and won several medals in the middle of the Olympics.
After showing its absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British bike team was a little disappointed in the journey to Rio.
During the period, many waves occurred, including the resignation of April technical director Sean Sutton for gender discrimination and bullying charges and the retirement of legends such as Hoy, Victoria Pendton.
But the first night of the bike house is enough to prove that the British team will be at its peak at a critical moment.
After little life comes to this world, parents are responsible for this life, not only in the health of the child, but also in spiritual development, i.e. education.
If the child fails in education, even if the career is successful, it cannot make up for the lack of life, the family's failure.
When a new life comes, the new parents need to spend time looking after and educate their children, responsible for him.
And responsible, in addition to physical conservation, health, and spiritual education, that is, to let children learn how to be human, how to be adults, how to succeed.
Good family education means that parents need to be accompanied by their children, care for their children, patient care, and to teach children to develop civilized words and deeds, to better learn and improve their intelligence.
Parents' words and deeds affect their children's growth, and they'll imitate their parents, which they often call dragons, Phoenix, rats' sons, and their parents are like children.
So parents need to be an example in front of their children, regulate their words and deeds, and develop their own good character, which can indirectly help children shape good hearts and make him better.
Amy's a smart and beautiful girl.
She's a lively person, she's very good with her friends, and she's very well adapted to the environment.
But Amy has a little secret in her heart: she can't focus on her studies, work tasks for a long time.
This secret has been with Amy for a long time.
Even through decentralized, modular time, she can basically do her job and achieve good results.
But when the mission is heavy, time is tight, Amy feels very painful and tortured.
Individual resistance to self-exposure and its emotional experience is not to threaten individual self-awareness and self-esteem.
There are also behavioral psychologists who understand resistance as individual insubordination to their behaviour.
I tried to get Amy to do a practice to calm herself down by breathing and relaxing and feeling that suffering.
And once she leaves that trapped situation, she feels relaxed and has been free again.

Original title: 2,000 chickens at Jiangsu I farm were arrested by the court to sell their sentence without permission
After the verdict came into force, Wang applied for enforcement in the court of Xianyang, because Li had failed to perform its obligations as determined by the judgement.
On 16 October 2014, the Xianyang Court ruled that 2,000 egg chickens in Li ' s farm were seized and not allowed to transfer and sell without permission.
Li, after receiving the detention decision, sold some of the egg chickens seized in the farm without permission from the court of Xinyang.

The head of the Industrial Coordination Division of the National Development Reform Commission today points out that excess steel capacity is a global problem.
Our production capacity utilization has been higher than the global average in recent years and above countries and regions such as Europe and Europe.
Our country has taken firm and effective measures to resolve excess capacity and its effectiveness is gradually emerging.
The head noted that the party Central State Department attached great importance to the global issue of steel overcapacity.
The departments, regions, are actively implementing the deployment of the State Council and are working hard, and this year they are about 45 million tons of crude steel capacity.
From our national circumstances, our country does not encourage steel exports, but rather a series of practical measures to control steel exports.
The director stressed that international trade in steel products was essentially market behaviour, which was an autonomous choice after the demand of importing countries, and that consumers had combined consideration of product value factors.
The implementation of trade protection measures does not help fundamentally address the development of the global steel industry, but rather only further impact on the international trade order.
Turning to debt, the head stressed that debt resolution was an important issue that needed to be properly addressed in the resolution of excess capacity.
Because of the size of the steel enterprise ' s assets and the wide range, some enterprises have complex debt relationships and may cause regional risks if the disposal is inappropriate.
According to the head, in recent years, as economic pressure increases, total social demand has gradually weakened and some industries have reduced capacity utilization and increased business production difficulties.
Some enterprises are not adapted to changes in the market environment, and production operations are difficult to continue or even collapse, but are subject to institutional institutional factors, with more market-based exits, becoming a zombie enterprise.
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces the efficiency of the use of essential resources, increases the cost of social management and hinders the establishment of a fair competitive market environment.
The main cause of the loss is the same as the dilemma facing the global steel industry - market demand is weak and low capacity utilization.
Our country is mainly using market mechanisms, economic instruments and rule of law, and the Government is primarily doing the bottom-up and social stability of employees and ensuring a fair and fair market order.
The director stressed that the next step is to continue to catch up with capacity and ensure that the target mission of 100 million to 150 million tons of crude steel capacity is completed for five years.
On the afternoon of 10th, when the Chinese tourist police appeared in the red field in Moscow, immediately attracted attention, and Chinese tourists waved with surprises, and locals and foreign tourists were on their feet.
On that day, the first professional tourism police force in China, the Sanya City Public Security Bureau of Hainan Province, arrived at the Moscow Red Field and exchange studies with the local tourist police.
Moscow Tourism Police are in the red field, Nikoliski Walk Street, Gum department store, etc., divided into three teams on duty, and the Chinese tourist police are studying with the guard for over an hour.
She's in her 20s, she knows English and Spanish, and she just joined the tourist police last year.
He looked closely at the words and actions of his Russian colleagues and talked to her from time to time.
When Spanish tourists came to consult, the Moscow tourist police used fluent Spanish to speak each other patiently, which impressed Wang Ice.
"The Moscow tourist police have foreign languages, and some of them have more than two, which is very touching us. "
" Hainan, as an international tourist island, is gradually focusing on attracting international tourists, and we want to improve our capabilities to match the status of international tourism islands ... "
Before studying with the guard, the Chinese tourist police also went to Moscow City Travel Police to communicate with their Russian colleagues.
"I often deal with Chinese tourists and I'm very happy to see them travel to Russia."
"The question they usually ask for help is: where the road goes, where a monument is, how to rent, how to get back to the hotel."
According to the Moscow City Tourism Police Captain Resakov, the urban environment and tourism atmosphere in Moscow has become more and more attractive to foreign tourists in recent years.
To adapt to tourism development needs, a tourism police force was established in July 2014 to patrol and defend and guide tourists in major attractions.
Currently, all Moscow tourist police are skilled in English and some of them are Spanish and German.
The police force divided them into nine teams according to foreign language levels, two classes a week, studying self-defence, laws and regulations and foreign languages.
"There are two tourist police officers who are now studying Chinese, and we're going to continue to raise their Chinese level," said Resakov.
Resakov told reporters that Moscow Tourism Police has gained some experience since its inception, hoping to inspire Sanya's colleagues.
He believes that cooperation between the Russian and Chinese police departments will enhance the security of their citizens to travel to each other country.
"The recruitment of Moscow tourist police personnel, police patterns, equipment, and good interaction with tourists have inspired us," Chen Xiaokun said.
The Chinese New Net journalist has found that at least nine provinces and municipalities such as Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian, Beijing, etc. have introduced rules for the implementation of residence permits.
With regard to the conditions for applying for a residence permit, the above-mentioned areas are generally proposed that more than six months of residence are required to live and meet legal and stable employment, and one of the conditions for continuous study.
New and Chinese journalists noted that the range of public services and facilities provided by some regions has expanded in terms of the treatment of residence permits.
These areas have increased the facilities for children to participate in the mid-level examination under conditions related conditions.
In addition, Beijing and others clearly require that the scope of public services and facilities be gradually expanded and regularly published to society.
For example, Fujian suggested that the scope of public services and facilities enjoyed by holders of residence permits is published to society at least every three years.
The Provisional Regulations on Residence Certificates provide that public security organs shall produce and issue residence permits within 15 days of the date of admissibility.
For the time frame for the issuance of certificates, most regions agree with the national version, i.e. within 15 days.
Hebei has made it clear that the residence permit shall be issued within three working days of the date of admissibility for the conditions of application and the full material and the place of residence.
Jiangxi provides that the public security organs shall produce a residence permit within five working days of the date of admissibility.
According to the Provisional Regulations on Residence Certificates, the above-mentioned areas are clear that they apply for a residence permit for the first time and are exempt from the cost of the document.
For example, Sichuan requires that public security police stations or commissioned community service agencies in various locations strictly enforce approved fee projects and rates, which are strongly prohibited from over-range, overstandard or a ride fee.
It was checked that on 27 July 2016, Chen Yangxia, former Secretary of the Dingnan County Council of the State of the city, reported to work as Director of the Party's Winds Supervisory (Deputy Director, one year of probation).
The wine that was used that night was provided by LEE's personal, and the other expenses were borne by someone Liu.
The Jiangxi Provincial Disciplinary Commission informed that Chen Yangxia, Chen Zhi Liang and others organized and accepted a request for food at private clubs, violating the eight central spirit and violated the discipline of the party.
Bogba ate two yellow cards in the Italian cup last season, which will automatically ban the race according to the rules.
Although he's turned back to the British Super, the British always extended its cumulative ban to the British Super.
So, in August 14th, Bogba will be on the wall, and his first show will be extended to the main game with Southampton on August 14.
As the first show in 2014, Saric will officially land next season and join the 76th Philly team.
As a young European player, many fans don't know him well, but through this Olympic Games, I believe that Saric's performance has made a deep impression.
The last Croatian race won Spain, and Salic successfully sealed Paul Gassol at the last minute trying to drag the game under the extra basket.
Recently, the 76-man commander Brett Brown gave Sarridge a high rating, and the chief of the horse sting thought he saw the shadow of Manu-Ginobili when he saw the young manu-Ginobili.
Apparently, Saric has shown his talent and has made 76 people looking forward to him.
Croatia's first two games at the Olympics, Sarich received 24 points, 17 baskets and 12 snails.
In the first half, Saric showed his ability to pull space on the field, and after he was broken down with his teammates, he was able to shoot outside the three-point line.
Although the 76-person inner line has now accumulated a lot of talented young players, they don't have Sarridge's external power.
From the cap to the long-term quick attack and the completion of the attack, the inner players who can do this on the NBA field today are numerous.
Since the beginning of the Olympic Games, Saric has been given 13 points, eight baskets and 5 snails in three games, and it's a full-scale performance.
Since the decision to return to the Knights in the summer of 2014, James has signed two consecutive contracts of 1+1.
With the NBA today, this labour agreement is about to enter its last year, as vice president of the NBA Club, James will be at the forefront of the negotiations on the labour agreement.
Given the significant increase in the union's income, thanks to the new television transmission agreement and the fight between the boss and the players about how to handle the money, the outside world is worried that the NBA will be suspended next summer.
But for James, he doesn't worry about becoming a free player next summer because he's renewed a three-year contract with the Knights.
Whenever the 2017-18 season starts, James is in the contract.
Since the iPhoneSE was amazing, the mobile market has also been on the screen.
A few days ago, Nubian also launched its first piece of the Z11 series: NubiaZ11mini.
NubiaZ11mini continues its consistent excellent photo gene and has a more easy-to-hand 5.0-inch screen, easy to use backprint recognition, and has achieved its remarkable experience of use.
The small screen photo phone Z11mini, which was just listed under the banner of Nubia, was down $200, from $1499 to $1299.
In terms of appearance, Nubia Z11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen, still a classic "Small Red Circle" design below the front.
The medium box is metal material, with a symmetric design and configuration of the Type-C data interface at the bottom.
The future of the Portland Smelter is full of uncertainty due to the cancellation of the power supply contract.
As the power company that powered the plant revealed that a factory owner would terminate a supply contract, thus invalidating all supply contracts, hundreds of workers in Portland, Victoria, are currently facing an uncertain future.
This initiative took place after the Victorian government decided not to continue to issue subsidies for the operation of the guaranteed plant.
This 20-year fixed subsidy will be terminated in November.
2,000 workers at the Portland factory in Aluminium may face unemployment.
Once the factory is closed, as many as 2,000 people may be directly or indirectly unemployed.
And because the plant's electricity is about 10% of Victoria's total power output, there may also be a chain reaction.
In 2014, Aluminium closed the Horn of Hanley Smelter, which led to the closure of the Angelsi power plant last year.
Aluminium Portland Smelter is currently in loss and at risk of closing.
This was made after predicting the plant in the coming years, initially because of the strong Australian dollar, and recently because of the price of plant products.
AGL provides electricity to this large aluminium smelter through the old Eyan power plant in the Latrob Valley, which predicts that three other factory owners will terminate their agreement.
The largest shareholder of the factory is a joint venture of Aluminium and Aluminium Oxygen, while China's China Group and the Japanese Maroon Red Society also holds a small share.
The joint venture said, "AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, which means that the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand. "
AGL says these contracts are "scramble contracts" that should have entered into force since November 2016.
The termination period for the contract is 12 months, so they will terminate in 2017.
The power company said, "As a result, AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in fiscal year 2017. "
Any income impact on AGL since 2018 is now optimistic from futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL states that the company has reduced the contract value of $187 million in the "expected termination activity".
Aluminium said that the decision to terminate these contracts "do not affect the ability of Aluminium to operate the smelter or guarantee the power supply of the smelter".
The American company stated that it had signed a 20-year contract with Old Eyan in 2010, which would have entered into force in November this year, but it did not explain why it withdrew.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago factory near Newcastle will be closed down because of the poor economic situation in the industry.
In response to the analyst's comments earlier this week, Stephen Michaelson, the AGL operator, said Portland had about 600 MW per year and that the Tomago plant reached about 900 MW.
If the two factories are closed, the demand in the electricity market will be significantly reduced.
He said, "As a power company, it's not good news for us."
Community Law Centers shut down 160,000 people every year.
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups are rejected by community law centres every year, and the service has been covered by further financial cuts.
In Queensland, three out of five people were rejected in seeking free legal advice and agency services, most of whom were older persons, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who did not have the resources to combat unfair expulsion.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the limit and now faces further financial cuts.
Since June next year, federal funding for these legal centres will be reduced by 30 per cent.
According to James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Law Centre, thousands of people are denied each year according to the latest survey of the National Community Association Law Centre.
Mr. Farrell said that this would only get worse if the federal government did not change the current decision.
He said, "The community law centre in Queensland has long been underfunded, which means that thousands of people will not be able to access the important services they need. "
Those who need to stay away from violence, those who carry huge debt that cannot be repaid, face disaggregated families, squeezed workers, all face legal problems, and the report shows that they cannot obtain the help they need.
The federal government will cut another 30 per cent of its funding since June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland Congressman George Brandis to withdraw these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in the face of legal issues.
Last year, the state government committed to raising legal aid funds to the national average.
It is now important to focus on the needs of community law centres and their corresponding communities, and the Belaki government must also be involved in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign team was prosecuted for pulling guns by staff.
New York: Trump's campaign team was prosecuted for pulling guns to a staff member in February when his head of North California drove a jeep.
Vincent Bodini, a former software trainer of the state campaign team, described the incident on Wednesday in the state court in Charlotte.
Bodini said he wanted this thing to be solved internally, but after a few months he realized, "This can't happen."
According to Bodini's description, the head of Earl Phillips "takes a pistol, put his right hand finger on the plate and pointed the gun at Vincent's kneebone."
After complaining to local and regional campaign leaders, Bodini learned from the file that at least four more people had experienced the same thing.
In his complaint, Bodini said, "No shooting means no harm."
Just two days before the case, the Republican presidential candidate told the crowd in North Carolina that if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and chosen her favorite judge, then "the person who supported the Second Amendment", which could act with gun support and gun lovers, which triggered anger.
Trump's campaign team said the press had no idea what he said about him, and he didn't advocate violence.
Bodini, in his complaint, asked the campaign team to pay compensation for his own negligence of supervision, and Philip to pay for his attacks, beatings and mental injuries.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not respond immediately to this information.
I can't reach Philip.
According to a local news agency in Charlotte, Philip recently left the campaign team.
His consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, did not respond immediately to the call.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign team is controversial.
The two sides in this case are the general court of the High Court of Bodini and Trump, 16-CS-14300, the Meklenburg County (Charlot).
Britain must pass the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport.
Heathrow will also bring energy and prosperity to our communities, London and the whole country.
For me, it's Heathrow's charm, as we did in the 2012 London Olympics, we did everything we could to ensure that our countries and territories could benefit from these events.
The Olympics benefited Stratford and the East Side.
And we're going to benefit the area again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local community alone, we will create 10,000 new apprentices, 40,000 new jobs and free young people around the airport from unemployment.
As before the 2012 London Olympics, some people thought Heathrow's expansion was too large.
I was told Britain will not be ready for the Olympics and we will be ashamed of the world.
The questioners' suspicions about the 2012 Olympics are wrong and their suspicions about Heathrow's project will be proven wrong.
Although there are always obstacles to overcome, Heathrow is addressing every problem facing.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for most people, not a few.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs, bringing about Pound21.1 billion in economic growth, leaving a technology and employment wealth around the airport and across the United Kingdom.
We have a great Heathrow project team, which has completed an infrastructure investment project on time and within the budget, including the T5 terminal, which was elected to the best airport terminal in the world for five years in a row and T2 terminal between the two most busy runways in the world.
Now, they're going to build the third runway with 16 billion pounds of private investment.
Britain successfully organized the London Olympics in 2012, and I believe that Heathrow Airport Extension Project will be a great success.
It's time for us to pass on the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport so that we can protect our future and create a technology and employment wealth that makes Britain proud.
Lord Paul Dayton is the Chairman of the Heathrow Airport Board and former business Counsellor of the British Treasury.
A woman committed suicide and was killed on the Swiss highway.
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
The woman who tried to kill herself was run by cars on the highway on Thursday morning, and the police are looking for witnesses.
The accident took place on the A1 highway near Mor Day, W.W.
According to the state police, a woman was lying on the road in the middle of the night and was run by multiple cars.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman with a clear suicide intent.
The woman died on the spot.
Police have revealed that several of the drivers involved have been investigated, but some of the drivers are still not confirmed.
Counsel for Giles Hofstair has indicated to the Geneva Tribune that criminal investigations have been initiated, which is the routine process of such incidents.
But we have no idea if the pilot will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
Hofstein said, "This will be determined by the prosecutor."
According to the results of two other similar cases over the past five years, the pilot will not be held accountable.
According to the report, both cases were caused by someone walking to the highway late at night, and the final verdict was that the pilot could not expect pedestrians to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was accused of negligent death on the A1 highway near Payena and killed him in August 2014.
The court learned that the 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking.
After the investigation, the judge stated that the female police officer was completely legal at the time of driving, and that the man appeared on the road "unexpected and unpredictable" and that the female police called the emergency number after that.
Anyone who can provide information about the accident near Mor Day on Thursday should call the police by calling 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: It was suitable for human residence on Venus
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was suitable for human residence.
Scientists at NASA Goddard Space Institute developed a model that explores the past of Venus, which uses tools and algorithms that are very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus, with high temperatures, waterless and atmospheres filled with carbon dioxide had a similar environment to the Earth.
Previously, scientists thought Venus was slower because it was thicker in its atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have a thinner, similar atmosphere to the Earth and the rate of rotation was as slow as it was.
The model also shows the early terrain of Venus.
Venus may have more dry areas than Earth, but there was enough water and geographical changes to give birth to life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early, the sunlight on Venus was 30% darker than the Earth.
At a press conference, Anthony del Genio, a scientist at the Goddard Space Institute, explained: "In the model simulation of the Goddard Space Institute, Venus slowly rotated its side for almost two months in the daytime. "
It warms the surface and produces rain that can form thick clouds, and the thick clouds are like an umbrella that prevents most of the sun's heat.
The result of the simulation is that the average climate temperature of Venus is actually a few degrees lower than the Earth now.
The model simulates the evolution of Venus close to what former planetary scientists predicted.
Although life may have existed on Venus, in the course of billions of years, Venus was exposed to excessive temperatures and ultraviolet light.
The ocean on the planet evaporates, and the water steam is burned out of ultraviolet light.
As hydrogen escapes, only the thicker CO2 atmosphere and deadly greenhouse gas effects, thus forming the Venus we know today.
Researchers published simulations of new Venus climate models in the journal Geophysical Research Newsletter.
Patrick Roy resigned as the commander of the Avalanche.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey team, who said he had no say at the team's decision-making level.
Joe Sachs, Executive Vice President of Colorado, confirmed the news and said the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
In his statement, 50-year-old Roy said, "In the last three years, I have been alive, passionate and determined to perform my duties as coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche."
I've been thinking about how to improve this team all summer and make it more powerful.
To that end, the coach and vice president's goal must be consistent with the club's goals.
He also needs to have a say in decision-making that affects the team's performance.
But for now, these conditions are not yet met.
Sachs hired Roy on May 23, 2013, and he thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sacchis said, "Prick told me today about his decision."
We thank him for his contribution to the club and hope he's going well in the future.
Roy was nominated as the best coach of the Jack Adams Award Alliance in the first season of teaching the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He helped the club get 112 points, first in the central division, but Colorado was eliminated by Minnesota in the first round of the post-season race, and in the last two years, he lost his arm with the post-season race.
In the 2015-16 season, the Avalan team scored 39 to 39 squares, and eventually lost the second card in the Western Union area at a five-point difference.
As a doorman of the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley cups, and two for the Montreal Canadians and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil field workers stopped on strike and continued negotiations
The chief negotiator said that workers in the North Sea oil fields had stopped a strike on pay, and the parties to the dispute had begun a new round of negotiations.
The Royal Dutch Shell North Sea Oil Platform has been on several strikes against the oil field service company Wood Group.
According to a joint statement, "Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the current dispute resolution process."
We'll start earlier next week, and we'll have a full-day meeting in the coming weeks to re-examine these issues.
The union stated that its recent action was to protest the potential of a maximum of 30 per cent of the salary cuts, which was the first time that the union has taken in 25 years.
Wood Group reduced the remuneration of North Sea contractors by about 9% this year due to market pressure.
Before the reduction, the company reduced the remuneration of maritime contractors by 10 per cent in 2014.
The company said that a new salary reduction would help companies get through the market depression.
Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries because the company needs to streamline its operations after its merger with the British Energy Corporation British Gas Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from the decline in crude oil prices and the British decision in June.
Dave Anderson, a member of the Scottish Parliament, met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the largest labour dispute of the North Sea generation.
He said the North Sea was vital to the regional economy.
Dave said in his statement, "In the North Sea and the country as a whole, we need an economy that serves most people, not a few."
In 2016, expenditures for the new North Sea project were projected to exceed $1.4 billion, compared to about $7 billion in average project expenditure over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of the star group.
The latest mission of this Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers collect the most complete speed of the star group.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why the stars of the constellation have different rotation speeds and the connection between the rotation cycle and the planet.
Infrared Processing Analysis Centre, Pasadena Polytechnic Institute, research scientist, at the Infrared Processing Analysis Centre, said at a press conference: "We want to learn more about the relationship between star mass, age, or even its solar system history by comparing our results. "
The Stars are 445 light years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in the constellation were born about 125 million years ago, and are now just becoming adult.
They're at the highest rate of rotation in their lives.
When they reach the highest rate of rotation, these mature stars shoot a lot of star wind.
When these star wind passes through the magnetic field of stars, they produce action for stars.
As stars grow older, their rotation starts to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of stars by tracking the time when the visible star blacks appear.
The latest rotation speed data set shows that larger stars are turning faster than smaller stars.
Raber compared stars to dancers, larger dancers rotate slower than smaller dancers.
Raber says, "In the "Breat Show" of the Humps, we find that slow-turning stars are often of greater quality, while the fastest-turning stars are often the lightest stars."
Because of the close range of stars, it can be used as the ideal space laboratory to compare the mass and rotation speed of stars.
Rebble says, "The Humps laid the foundation for the two-way rotation theory model of young and old stars."
We still have a lot of knowledge about how stars slow and why they slow down and "stop our shoes."
In three new papers, Raber and her colleagues elaborate on their latest analysis of the speed of the rotation of the Hiroshi Group, which will soon be published in Astronomy Journal.
The head of the South Lake Park Water Management Section, Zheng Jianjun, introduced that the bottom of the South Lake is more than 10 metres below, and that water is likely to be in danger.
" Although the South Lake rescue team is very professional, it is hoped that the vast range of boating tourists will wear life jackets and do not do violations on the lake and play safely. " Zheng Jianjun said.
The village has a unique marine environment, with two main leisure tourism resources for natural ecology and human ecology.
"But individual owners who bought small spaces, afraid that it would affect the rental price of their parking space and suspected that others had a personal heart, so they had been destroyed behind their backs, resulting in the placement of the parking space on hold. "
The subject of when potatoes are introduced, the academic world still has different statements.
In the current more mainstream view, the introduction of potatoes has three main lines.
The three lines introduced by the potatoes were the most influential and the most widely spread were the introduction of Chen Jinlong from the Philippines to Fukuo.
The Beijing City Social Group Management Office will conduct a special examination of the use of uniform receipts for social groups.
The inspection is divided into self-checking and focused checks.
Presentation by the relevant head of the municipal association, which included social groups that received uniform receipts for social group contributions from 2013 to 2015.
In the Olympic communications strategy developed by the Rio Commission in 20'2 years, said, "The success of the Olympics is defined by people who share stories in social media."
From the Olympic Games, media have changed a lot more than ever in many ways of spreading, product patterns, language styles, news perspectives.
The IOC and media practitioners of the world seem to be meeting this round of challenges.
On August 11, the H shares of light securities entered the last day of the public sale. There are reports that the market response was flat on the first two days of the recruitment... and that it will be listed on August 18th at the Hong Kong Exchange.
A domestic voucher analyst says that Eastern securities are not well based on port, and that the management of the flag is the director of the East Certificate.
Experts noted that as the securities market returned to flat this year, many vouchers' performance has declined, but the company has been listed more about the development of the company ' s own business and cannot be generalized.
After this regulation, Suzhou will be the first second-line city in the country to restart the restricted purchase.
The second-line city that has introduced or is about to introduce a city regulation policy is not only Suzhou, but also cities like Fatty, Nanking.
Previously, Fat Fats had been the first to issue a limited loan policy, and banks would refuse to provide mortgage services for those with two rooms and with an unliquidated housing loan.
